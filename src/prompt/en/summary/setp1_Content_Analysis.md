*   The output content must meet the Markdown format requirements: clear hierarchy, standardized punctuation, and easy to read.

**5. Additional Instructions**

*   In practical use, if it is found that the text content has special formats or structures, the analysis dimensions can be flexibly adjusted according to the actual situation.
*   For complex or lengthy texts, it is recommended to gradually break down and describe the content of each part in detail to ensure the depth and completeness of the analysis.
