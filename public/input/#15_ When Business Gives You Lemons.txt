[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast, powered by Turnkey Coach, where we help business owners find freedom over fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matt Reynolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm his brother, Chris Reynolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us as we help build your business and move from fear to freedom together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Friday, Build Your Business listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your co-host, Matt Reynolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are actually going to take the week off this week because Chris and I are both business owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, we're like real life business owners, not just podcasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when you're a business owner, crap hits the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had a little bit of a weird week this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris and I love doing this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done incredibly well in the ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris was up all night last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were settled to record this this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was up all night last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: with an emergency tech situation with one of his clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that next week I can convince him to talk a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any of the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been incredibly sick with a stomach virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually down at a resort with my wife for our birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've pretty much stayed in the room while I was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll spare you the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between me being sick and Chris having some emergency issues where he had to work all through the night, we're going to take this week off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be back next Friday for a new episode of the build your business podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, hoping we can talk about, because I think it's a really great episode topic of how do we handle when crap hits the fan?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably use a different language at that point, but sometimes it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happens when you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: A real business owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to just act like everything is always great in our businesses and they always work incredibly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you hit those speed bumps or those roadblocks, we'll give you some tidbits about how we handle those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to ask Chris some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it feel like working entirely through the night?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that a couple of times, but not.
[SPEAKER_00]: probably as many times as he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it should be a good episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll also, I know we've got an episode coming up on the game plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of led into that last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: All new episode coming out next Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang on with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you guys next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys have a great weekend and a great week next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you on Friday.
