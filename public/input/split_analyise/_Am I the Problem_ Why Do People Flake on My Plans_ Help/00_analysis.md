## 现代社交焦虑：为何我们越来越难敲定朋友聚会？

### 原文内容

[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.

[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.

## 深度思考

### 多维视角
从这段对话中，我们可以看到一个独特的观察角度：**社交计划的复杂性往往源于个体对社交能量的管理，而非对关系的真实态度**。很多人并不是不想社交，而是因为社交焦虑、精力管理或生活节奏等原因，导致他们难以做出或履行社交计划。这种现象在现代社会中尤为普遍，尤其是在生活节奏快、压力大的环境中。

### 核心洞察：
1. **社交焦虑与精力管理**：许多人在面对社交计划时，会感到焦虑或不确定自己是否能在特定时间点有足够的精力参与。这种焦虑可能导致他们拖延或回避计划的确认。
2. **社交能力指数**：每个人的社交能力在不同生活阶段会有所波动。忙碌的生活、家庭责任或工作压力可能会降低一个人的社交能力，使其难以有效沟通或履行计划。
3. **社交动态的复杂性**：在涉及多人的社交计划中（如夫妻或家庭），个体的社交意愿和焦虑可能会相互影响，导致计划的难以落实。

### 简化解决方案：
1. **明确沟通**：在提出社交计划时，明确表达自己的期望和时间安排，减少不确定性。
2. **理解与包容**：理解对方可能面临的社交焦虑或生活压力，避免过度解读对方的行为。
3. **灵活安排**：尝试更灵活的社交方式，如短时间的聚会或非正式的活动，降低对方的心理负担。

通过这个角度，我们可以更轻松地理解社交计划中的种种“拖延”和“回避”，并找到更有效的沟通和安排方式。

### 思维激发
### 核心变量提取
1. **社交焦虑 (Social Anxiety) ≈ 计划制定困难**
   - 表现为对社交活动的过度思考和担忧
   - 导致无法果断确认或执行计划

2. **社交能力指数 (Social Competency Index) ≈ 计划沟通与执行能力**
   - 定义：清晰沟通社交计划并跟进执行的能力
   - 影响因素：生活阶段、个人状态、社交舒适度

3. **社交舒适度 (Social Comfort) ≈ 计划接受度**
   - 与熟悉度正相关：与亲密朋友的计划更容易接受
   - 与新认识的人的计划更容易引发焦虑

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **社交焦虑 → 计划制定困难**
   - 对社交活动的过度思考导致无法果断确认或执行计划
   - 表现为拖延、犹豫、最终取消计划

2. **社交能力指数 → 计划沟通与执行能力**
   - 生活阶段和个人状态影响社交能力指数
   - 高社交能力指数的人更容易清晰沟通并执行计划

3. **社交舒适度 → 计划接受度**
   - 与亲密朋友的计划更容易接受，因为社交舒适度高
   - 与新认识的人的计划更容易引发焦虑，因为社交舒适度低

### 知识精髓提炼
社交焦虑和社交能力指数是影响计划制定和执行的核心因素。社交舒适度则进一步决定了个人对不同类型计划的接受度。理解这些变量及其相互关系，可以帮助我们更好地应对社交计划中的挑战，减少误解和焦虑。

### 本质思考
从这段对话中，我们可以分析出几个本质性的问题：

1. **社交焦虑的本质**：社交焦虑不仅仅是对社交场合的恐惧，更是对不确定性和自我评价的过度关注。它源于对他人评价的敏感和对自我表现的担忧，导致人们在面对社交计划时产生犹豫和拖延。

2. **计划困难的核心**：计划困难的核心在于人们对时间和精力的不确定性。现代生活的忙碌和多重角色使得人们难以预测未来的状态，因此对计划的承诺变得犹豫不决。这种不确定性进一步加剧了社交焦虑。

3. **社交能力的动态性**：社交能力并非固定不变，而是随着生活阶段和环境的变化而波动。在高压或忙碌的时期，人们的社交能力会显著下降，导致计划难以落实。这种动态性使得社交互动变得更加复杂。

4. **社交互动的矛盾**：社交互动中存在一种内在矛盾：人们渴望连接，但又害怕被消耗。这种矛盾导致了社交计划中的推拉现象，即表面上表达兴趣，实际上却难以付诸行动。

5. **社交关系的本质**：社交关系的本质在于双方的匹配度。无论是个人还是夫妻，社交计划的成功与否取决于双方的需求和舒适度是否一致。这种匹配度决定了社交互动的深度和持续性。

总结来说，社交计划的困难源于人类对不确定性、自我评价和精力管理的复杂心理机制，而这些机制在现代社会中尤为突出。

### 类比思考
就像在玩一场永远无法结束的捉迷藏游戏，每个人都躲在各自的焦虑和忙碌中，互相寻找却总是错过。社交计划就像一场精心编排的舞蹈，但舞步总是错乱，节奏总是失调。有人害怕迈出第一步，有人担心踩到对方的脚，还有人干脆躲在角落里，假装自己不在场。这场舞蹈的规则复杂得像迷宫，而每个人都在迷宫中迷失，寻找着出口却总是绕回原点。

### 沉思者
这段对话揭示了现代社会中一个普遍但鲜少被深入探讨的现象：**社交焦虑与计划制定的复杂性**。表面上，这只是一场关于“为什么有些人总是难以制定计划”的讨论，但背后却折射出更深层次的社会心理问题。

### 1. **社交焦虑的隐形枷锁**
Katie提到，她对社交计划的犹豫源于**社交焦虑**。她害怕在社交场合中表现不佳，担心自己会说错话、不被喜欢，甚至担心自己会在计划的时间点突然“不想去”。这种焦虑并非个例，而是许多人在面对新关系或不熟悉的社交场合时的共同体验。社交焦虑像一种隐形的枷锁，束缚了人们主动建立联系的意愿，甚至让一些人在面对邀请时选择逃避或拖延。

然而，这种焦虑并非单向的。Jen的焦虑则表现为**对被拒绝的恐惧**。她担心别人不想和她见面，甚至将对方的拖延解读为“他们其实并不想和我交往”。这种“被拒绝”的恐惧与Katie的“社交表现焦虑”形成了一种恶性循环：一方因为焦虑而拖延，另一方则将拖延解读为拒绝，最终导致双方都陷入误解和失望。

### 2. **社会节奏与“社交能力指数”的下降**
Jason提出的“社交能力指数”概念非常有趣。他指出，现代生活的快节奏和高压力让许多人的社交能力“降级”了。即使一个人曾经擅长制定计划，在繁忙的生活中，他们也可能变得拖延或难以跟进。这种“降级”并非因为他们不再重视社交，而是因为他们的**精力被其他优先级更高的任务占据**。

这种“社交能力下降”的现象在对话中得到了印证。无论是Katie的犹豫，还是Jen的失望，都反映了现代人在社交中的挣扎。我们生活在一个信息过载、任务繁重的时代，社交计划往往被挤到了“待办事项”的末尾。即使我们想要维持关系，时间和精力的匮乏让我们难以付诸行动。

### 3. **社交中的“权力动态”与隐性规则**
对话中还揭示了一个更深层次的问题：**社交中的权力动态**。Jen提到，她总是主动发起计划，而对方却很少回应或跟进。这种“单方面努力”的现象让她感到沮丧，甚至怀疑自己是否“不够重要”。这种感受背后，隐藏着社交中的一种隐性规则：**谁主动，谁就处于“弱势”**。主动发起计划的人往往承担了更多的心理负担，而被动回应的人则掌握了“是否参与”的权力。

这种权力动态在夫妻关系中尤为明显。当一对夫妻与另一对夫妻交往时，如果其中一方对另一方不感兴趣，整个计划就可能被搁置。这种“夫妻社交”的复杂性让许多人感到疲惫，甚至选择放弃拓展社交圈。

### 4. **社交的未来：如何打破恶性循环？**
那么，如何打破这种恶性循环？对话中提供了一些线索：
- **理解与共情**：认识到对方的拖延或犹豫并非针对个人，而是源于他们的焦虑或生活压力。
- **简化社交**：减少对计划的期待，接受“临时安排”或“轻松见面”的可能性。
- **打破“夫妻社交”的束缚**：允许个人关系独立于夫妻关系存在，减少对“完美四人组”的执着。

### 5. **核心洞察**
这场对话的核心在于：**社交焦虑与计划制定的困难并非个人问题，而是现代社会的集体困境**。我们生活在一个充满不确定性和高压力的时代，社交能力被不断削弱，而社交中的权力动态则让许多人感到疲惫和失望。要解决这个问题，我们需要更多的理解、更少的期待，以及一种更灵活的社交方式。

最终，社交的本质并非“完美计划”，而是**人与人之间的真实连接**。即使计划被拖延、被取消，只要我们愿意理解彼此，这种连接依然可以存在。

### 质疑者
在这段对话中，我们可以看到几个关键问题围绕着社交计划的制定和执行展开。让我们通过休谟的怀疑之锥来解构这些问题：

1. **社交焦虑与计划制定**：
   - 对话中提到的社交焦虑如何影响人们制定和确认计划？
   - 这种焦虑是否普遍存在，还是特定于某些个体？

2. **社交能力指数**：
   - 提出的“社交能力指数”是否是一个有效的衡量标准？
   - 这个指数如何量化个人的社交能力，特别是在不同生活阶段的变化？

3. **计划制定的复杂性**：
   - 为什么有些人即使有意愿，也难以制定和确认社交计划？
   - 这种复杂性是否与个人的生活方式、工作压力或其他外部因素有关？

4. **社交互动的动态**：
   - 在社交互动中，如何平衡个人的舒适度与他人的期望？
   - 这种平衡如何影响长期的社交关系和计划制定？

5. **社交计划的执行**：
   - 为什么有些人在制定计划后难以执行，即使他们最初表现出兴趣？
   - 这种执行困难是否与个人的内在动机或外部压力有关？

通过这些问题，我们可以更深入地理解社交计划制定和执行中的复杂性，以及如何通过更好的沟通和理解来改善这些互动。

## 从投资到社交：当代人如何应对‘承诺恐惧症’？

### 原文内容

[P1] You're here for tips on leveling up your career, but here's a bonus tip on leveling up your investments.
[P2] Check out Public.
[P3] Public is an investing platform where you can invest in stocks, options, bonds, ETFs, and crypto all in one place.
[P4] Public is a modern brokerage and has brought innovation to aspects of investing that were dinosaur-y.
[P5] I'll give you an example.
[P6] Public is one of the only brokerages to offer self-directed investing in bonds, even treasuries, which have historically been sold primarily through a government website.
[P7] But with Public, you can invest in treasuries with just a few clicks right from your phone.
[P8] And public allows you to make fractional investments in bonds.
[P9] So before fractional bonds on public, you had to buy government bonds starting with a $1,000 investment at a minimum.
[P10] And if you wanted to invest in any more than that, you could only invest in $100 increments.
[P11] Now you can buy bonds for as little as $100 and for any dollar amount on public.
[P12] That's just one example of how public is making it easier to invest, but there are a ton more and you can explore them for yourself at public.com slash help wanted.
[P13] To get started with your portfolio today, go to public.com slash help wanted.
[P14] This is a paid endorsement for public investing.
[P15] Full disclosure and conditions can be found in the podcast description.
[P16] Doesn't it feel like every time you step out the door, you have to pay a fee?
[P17] I mean, it is nuts.
[P18] I've been traveling a lot for the holidays and the amount of fees I pay just to get from point A to point B, it is mind boggling.
[P19] And it makes it really hard to stick with my spending plan.
[P20] When we're trying to make progress, life's curve balls often feel like taking one step forward and two steps back.
[P21] A chime checking account makes financial progress easier with features like no maintenance fees, fee-free overdraft up to $200,
[P22] or getting paid up to two days early with direct deposit.
[P23] Learn more at chime.com slash help wanted.
[P24] And once you go to chime.com slash help wanted, you'll learn more about the fee-free overdraft up to $200.
[P25] And let me tell you, that is such a game changer.
[P26] Make progress towards a better financial future with Chime.
[P27] Open your account in two minutes at chime.com slash helpwanted.
[P28] That's chime.com slash helpwanted.
[P29] Chime.
[P30] Feels like progress.
[P31] Banking services and debit card provided by the BankCorp Bank N.A.
[P32] or Stride Bank N.A.
[P33] Members FDIC.
[P34] SpotMe eligibility requirements and overdraft limits apply.
[P35] Boosts are available to eligible Chime members enrolled in SpotMe and are subject to monthly limits.
[P36] Timing depends on submission of payment file.
[P37] Fees apply at out-of-network ATMs.
[P38] This is Help Wanted, the show that makes your work work for you.
[P39] I'm Jason Pfeiffer, editor-in-chief of Entrepreneur Magazine.
[P40] And I'm money expert, Nicole Lappin.
[P41] On Tuesdays, Jason and I answer the helpline and help callers solve their work problems.
[P42] And on Thursdays, I give you one way to improve your work and build a career or company you love.
[P43] And it starts now.

[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.

## 深度思考

### 多维视角
### 独特视角：**物理距离决定社交模式**

#### 分析：
1. **尺度转换**：将社交互动的微观行为放大到物理空间层面
2. **系统思维**：考虑空间布局对群体互动的系统性影响
3. **历史视角**：借鉴疫情期间的社交经验，发现物理距离的意外效果

#### 洞察：
- 物理距离是影响群体对话模式的关键变量
- 适当的距离能强制维持整体对话，防止自然分裂
- 这种模式可以主动设计，而不仅依赖偶然

#### 应用建议：
1. **空间设计**：在聚会时主动调整座位布局，创造适度距离
2. **规则制定**：明确"无侧聊"规则，保持对话统一
3. **场景创新**：借鉴疫情期间的经验，设计新型社交场景

#### 行动步骤：
1. 选择合适场地，确保座位间有适度距离
2. 提前告知参与者"无侧聊"规则
3. 设计引导话题，维持整体对话
4. 观察效果，持续优化

#### 总结：
通过主动设计物理空间和对话规则，可以创造更均衡、更有意义的群体互动体验。这种基于物理距离的社交设计，既借鉴了疫情期间的意外发现，又将其转化为可复制的社交策略。

### 思维激发
### 核心变量提取
1. **友情维护**：友情 ≈ 独立于夫妻关系
2. **对话模式**：对话 ↔ 分组（男 vs 女）→ 不均衡
3. **社交动态**：距离（10英尺）→ 对话模式（整体）≈ 均衡贡献
4. **对话管理**：对话管理（禁止分组）→ 整体参与

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **友情独立**：友情 - 夫妻依赖 ≈ 更纯粹
2. **对话分组问题**：默认分组 → 对话不均衡 + 社交体验差
3. **距离影响**：距离（10英尺）→ 对话无法分组 ≈ 整体参与
4. **管理策略**：禁止分组对话 → 整体参与 + 社交体验提升

### 知识精髓提炼
友情维护 ≈ 独立于夫妻关系 + 对话管理（禁止分组）→ 均衡贡献 + 社交体验提升

### 本质思考
从演化分析来看，社交对话的分裂现象源于人类早期群体生活中的分工需求，男性多从事狩猎等体力活动，女性多从事采集等细致工作，这种分工模式在潜意识中延续至今。从矛盾分析来看，群体对话中存在集体交流与个体交流的矛盾，每个人都希望参与整体对话，但又容易被特定话题吸引而陷入小范围交流。从存在理由来看，群体对话的分裂反映了人类社交中既渴望群体归属又追求个体表达的深层需求。通过现象学还原，我们发现群体对话的本质是信息交流与情感联结的统一过程。从属和种差来看，群体对话是一种多主体参与的、动态平衡的社交互动形式，其特殊性在于既要维持整体性又要包容个体性。

### 类比思考
就像一场音乐会，本该是四重奏，却常常变成两个二重唱。每个人都该在同一个舞台上演奏，而不是各自为政。保持距离反而让声音更和谐，这真是讽刺。就像疫情期间的社交距离，意外地创造了一个平等的对话空间。现在距离消失了，对话却分裂了。我们需要一个指挥家，时刻提醒大家保持合奏，而不是各自独奏。

### 沉思者
在这个看似简单的社交场景中，我们其实可以看到现代社会中人际关系的微妙变化和深层矛盾。表面上，我们讨论的是如何在四人聚会中避免对话分裂成男女两组的尴尬局面，但背后反映的却是我们对社交效率和深度的焦虑。

首先，让我们看看这个问题的根源。为什么在四人聚会中，对话会自然地分裂成男女两组？这不仅仅是性别差异的问题，更是我们内心深处对社交效率的追求。我们习惯了快速分类和标签化，以便在复杂的社交环境中找到自己的位置。这种分裂实际上是我们对社交效率的一种妥协，因为我们默认了性别是划分社交圈的最简单标准。

然而，这种分裂带来的问题显而易见。它限制了我们的社交深度，使得我们无法真正了解彼此的全貌。就像COVID期间，由于物理距离的限制，四人必须保持统一的对话，反而创造了一种更为平等和深入的交流方式。这让我们意识到，真正的社交深度往往需要打破我们习以为常的分类和标签。

那么，如何避免这种对话分裂呢？Jason提出的“禁止侧聊”策略看似简单，实则是对现代社交习惯的一种挑战。它要求我们在社交场合中保持更高的专注度和参与度，而不是任由对话自然分裂。这种策略的成功与否，取决于我们是否愿意放弃对社交效率的追求，转而追求更为真实和深入的交流。

然而，这种策略也暴露了现代社交的另一个深层矛盾：我们对社交深度的渴望与对社交效率的追求之间的矛盾。在快节奏的现代生活中，我们往往希望在最短的时间内获得最大的社交收益，这种心态使得我们难以真正投入到深度交流中。我们习惯了快速切换话题，习惯了在对话中寻找最有效的沟通方式，却忽略了真正的交流需要时间和耐心。

最终，这个看似简单的社交问题，其实反映了现代社会中人际关系的复杂性和矛盾性。我们渴望深度交流，却又追求社交效率；我们想要打破性别标签，却又习惯了快速分类。或许，真正的解决方案并不在于如何避免对话分裂，而在于我们是否愿意放下对社交效率的执着，真正投入到每一次交流中。只有这样，我们才能在四人聚会中创造出真正平等和深入的交流氛围，而不是被性别标签和社交效率所束缚。

### 质疑者
让我们对这个对话进行系统性分析：

1. **概念澄清**
   - 对话涉及两个主要话题：投资平台Public的推广和社交互动中的对话模式
   - 需要区分商业推广内容和真实社交场景讨论

2. **概念溯源**
   - Public平台的推广部分明显是付费广告，符合现代播客的商业模式
   - 关于社交对话模式的讨论源于疫情期间的特殊经历，反映了社交习惯的变迁

3. **解构假设**
   - 广告部分假设听众需要更便捷的投资方式
   - 社交讨论部分假设传统的"男女分组"对话模式存在问题
   - 需要质疑这些假设的普遍性和必要性

4. **辩证分析**
   - 投资平台的便利性确实重要，但也要考虑投资风险和教育
   - 社交对话模式既有传统惯性，也有创新可能，需要平衡
   - 疫情期间的特殊经历提供了新的社交视角，但不一定适用于所有场景

5. **刷新表述**
   - 商业推广需要更加透明和负责任，强调风险教育
   - 社交互动可以更加灵活，不必拘泥于特定模式
   - 关键是要建立真诚、平等的交流，而不是强制某种形式

6. **建设性建议**
   - 对于投资：在追求便利的同时，更要注重金融素养的提升
   - 对于社交：可以尝试新的对话方式，但不必完全否定传统模式
   - 最重要的是培养真诚交流的能力，而不是过度关注形式

这个分析展示了如何通过系统性怀疑达到更深入的理解，同时提出建设性的改进建议。

## 夫妻社交困境：当‘四人约会’变成心理博弈

### 原文内容

[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.

[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.

[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.

### 分析结果

## 总结分析

### 1.价值点提取
#### 一级提炼（基础层）
- **核心观点1**：在社交场合中，夫妻或情侣之间的互动可能会因为其中一方的舒适度问题而变得复杂。  
    - 论据1：当一方不愿意与另一对夫妻中的某个人相处时，另一方可能会感到尴尬，甚至需要为对方掩饰（P499-P505）。  
    - 论据2：这种不协调的互动会导致社交活动的重复性降低，甚至可能影响两对夫妻之间的友谊（P500-P503）。  
- **核心观点2**：在多人对话中，避免对话分裂成小群体是维持整体互动质量的关键。  
    - 论据1：在COVID期间，由于物理距离的限制，对话被迫保持整体性，从而创造了一种更平等的互动模式（P540-P543）。  
    - 论据2：当物理距离消失后，对话容易分裂成小群体，导致互动质量下降（P547-P548）。  

#### 二级提炼（传播层）
- **争议性观点1**：在社交场合中，是否应该强制要求所有人参与整体对话，而不是允许小群体对话？  
    - 可能的反对观点：强制要求所有人参与整体对话可能会让某些人感到不自在，尤其是当他们与某些人没有共同话题时（P509-P512）。  
    - 附加案例：在P509-P512中，作者提到自己不愿意与不喜欢的妻子进行对话，甚至拒绝参与这种互动。  
- **争议性观点2**：物理距离是否真的能够改善社交互动的质量？  
    - 可能的反对观点：物理距离可能只是暂时性的解决方案，长期来看，社交互动的质量仍然取决于个体的兴趣和性格匹配度（P547-P548）。  
    - 附加案例：在P547-P548中，作者提到COVID结束后，物理距离的消失导致对话再次分裂，表明物理距离并非根本解决方案。  

#### 三级提炼（爆点层）
- **情感共鸣点**：在社交互动中，面对不协调的关系时，许多人会感到尴尬和无奈，尤其是在需要为伴侣掩饰时（P503-P505）。这种情感共鸣点揭示了人们在社交场合中常见的心理压力。  

### 类比/隐喻
- **原概念**：在P510中，作者提到“pulling teeth”（拔牙）来比喻与不喜欢的人进行对话时的痛苦和困难。

## 深度思考

### 多维视角
### 简化社交困境的独特视角：**物理距离的魔力**

#### 问题核心
两对夫妇聚会时，对话容易分裂成“妻子对妻子”和“丈夫对丈夫”的单独交流，导致部分人感到不适或无聊。

#### 独特观察角度
**物理距离的调整**可以强制对话保持整体性，避免分裂。

#### 解决步骤
1. **保持适当距离**：在聚会时，确保所有人坐得足够远，无法自然形成小圈子对话。例如，10英尺的距离可以迫使大家保持整体交流。
2. **明确规则**：在聚会开始时，明确宣布“无侧聊”规则，提醒所有人保持整体对话。
3. **设计活动**：安排需要所有人参与的活动或游戏，避免对话分裂。例如，桌游或集体讨论话题。
4. **轮流引导**：指定一个人负责引导对话，确保每个人都有机会发言，避免某些人主导或沉默。
5. **反馈机制**：聚会结束后，询问大家的感受，调整下一次聚会的安排，确保所有人都感到舒适和参与。

#### 结论
通过调整物理距离和明确规则，可以有效地避免对话分裂，创造更和谐和有趣的聚会氛围。

### 思维激发
### 核心变量提取
- 社交互动 = 个体A + 个体B + 关系动态
- 不匹配 = 个体A ≈ 个体B - 共同兴趣
- 对话分裂 = 群体对话 → 子群体对话
- 强制统一 = 群体对话 ↔ 禁止子群体对话

### 逻辑链条构建
1. 社交互动中的不匹配（个体A ≈ 个体B - 共同兴趣）导致不适感
2. 不适感 → 个体A选择回避或掩盖真实感受
3. 对话分裂（群体对话 → 子群体对话）加剧不匹配
4. 强制统一（群体对话 ↔ 禁止子群体对话）试图解决分裂问题

### 知识精髓提炼
社交互动中的核心问题在于不匹配和对话分裂，强制统一是一种解决方案，但可能带来新的社交压力。关键在于找到平衡点，使得群体对话既能保持统一，又能容纳个体差异。

### 本质思考
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个社交互动的本质。从演化角度看，人类作为群居动物，社交互动是生存和繁衍的基本需求。然而，现代社交场景中的"分桌对话"现象，揭示了社交互动中一个深层的矛盾：群体归属感与个体舒适度之间的张力。

通过现象学还原，我们可以褪去表面的社交礼仪，看到这种现象的本质：它反映了人类在群体互动中寻求个人认同与群体和谐之间的永恒困境。当个体在群体中感到不适时，往往会本能地寻找更舒适的小群体互动，这实际上是一种自我保护机制。

从存在主义的角度看，这种现象的存在源于人类对真实交流的渴望。当个体感到无法在群体中找到共鸣时，就会自然地转向更小范围的交流。这既是人类追求真实连接的体现，也是个体在群体中寻求自我认同的表现。

因此，我们可以这样定义"分桌对话"现象：它是人类在群体社交中，为寻求个体舒适度和真实连接而产生的一种自发性的小群体互动模式，反映了群体归属感与个体认同感之间的内在矛盾。

这个本质定义揭示了现代社交互动中的一个核心困境：如何在保持群体和谐的同时，尊重每个个体的舒适度和交流需求。理解这一点，或许能帮助我们更好地设计社交场景，创造更和谐的群体互动体验。

### 类比思考
就像一场四重奏，每个乐器都要和谐共鸣，而不是各自为政。社交聚会也是如此，需要全体参与的交响乐，而非分裂的独奏。保持距离反而让对话凝聚，就像疫情时期的十英尺间隔，迫使大家共同演奏。要防止对话分裂，就得像指挥家一样，果断喊停旁枝末节，让主旋律始终清晰。没有旁白，只有合奏，这才是完美的社交乐章。

### 沉思者
### 现状分析
在现代社交中，两对夫妇聚会时，常常会出现一种尴尬的局面：妻子们和丈夫们各自形成小圈子，导致整体交流的割裂。这种现象不仅让参与者感到不适，还可能影响友谊的深度和质量。特别是在COVID期间，由于社交距离的限制，人们被迫保持一定的距离，反而促进了更均衡的群体交流。

### 个体剖析
从个体角度来看，每个人在社交场合中的舒适度和兴趣点各不相同。有些人可能不愿意与某些人交流，或者感到被迫参与不感兴趣的对话。这种不适感会导致他们在聚会中显得被动或冷漠，甚至可能选择回避未来的社交活动。此外，个体之间的化学反应也至关重要，缺乏共同话题或兴趣点会使得交流变得生硬和尴尬。

### 群体透视
从群体角度来看，社交活动的成功与否往往取决于群体动态的平衡。当交流被割裂成小圈子时，整体的互动质量会大打折扣。这种现象反映了社会中更深层次的社交习惯和性别角色分工。传统的性别角色分工可能使得妻子们和丈夫们在社交场合中自然而然地形成各自的圈子，而忽视了整体交流的重要性。

### 思考整合
要解决这种社交割裂的问题，首先需要意识到其存在并主动采取措施。例如，通过明确禁止小圈子对话，强制保持整体交流的连贯性。此外，创造一种平等的交流环境，鼓励每个人参与整体对话，而不是局限于性别或兴趣的小圈子。这不仅能够提升社交活动的质量，还能促进更深层次的友谊和理解。

### 核心洞察
社交割裂的根源在于传统的性别角色分工和个体舒适度的差异。要打破这种局面，需要主动调整社交习惯，创造平等的交流环境，确保每个人都能参与并享受整体对话。这不仅是对个体舒适度的尊重，也是对群体动态的优化。

### 质疑者
让我们从多个角度来解构这个社交困境：

1. **定义澄清**
- "社交分裂"指的是群体对话自然分成小团体的现象
- "无侧聊"是一种主动维持整体对话的策略

2. 概念溯源
- 社交分裂源于人类自然的群体互动模式
- COVID时期的物理距离无意中创造了一种新的对话模式

3. 解构假设
- 假设1：夫妻必须各自成对交流
   - 质疑：这种模式是否必要？是否存在更好的替代方案？
- 假设2：社交分裂不可避免
   - 质疑：是否有方法可以主动引导对话走向？

4. 辩证分析
- 正面：社交分裂让内向者更舒适，允许深度交流
- 反面：可能造成群体分裂，降低整体互动质量

5. 建设性建议
- 采用"无侧聊"策略，主动维护整体对话
- 创造物理环境（如圆桌）促进群体互动
- 设计引导性问题，吸引所有人参与
- 定期切换话题，保持对话活力

6. 更深层思考
- 这种社交困境反映了现代社会中的人际关系复杂性
- 我们需要在个人舒适与群体和谐之间寻找平衡
- 也许应该重新思考传统社交模式，探索更灵活的互动方式

最终结论：
社交分裂并非不可改变的自然法则。通过主动引导和适当策略，我们可以创造更富有成效、更包容的群体互动体验。关键在于平衡个体需求与群体和谐，同时保持开放和灵活的态度。

## 社交能力指数：你的‘计划执行力’及格了吗？

### 原文内容

[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.

[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.

## 深度思考

### 多维视角
### 从"社交能力指数"到"社交能量管理"

你提出的"社交能力指数"概念很有意思，但让我们换个角度思考——与其把社交能力看作一个固定的指数，不如把它视为一种"社交能量"的管理问题。

想象每个人都有一个"社交能量账户"。在忙碌的创造期（如建立家庭或专注事业），我们的社交能量会自然消耗得更快。这不是能力下降，而是能量分配的问题。

**解决思路：**
1. **能量评估**：定期检查自己的社交能量水平
2. **优先级排序**：把有限的社交能量用在最重要的关系上
3. **质量替代数量**：减少社交频率，但提高每次社交的质量
4. **明确沟通**：直接告知朋友当前的能量状态，设定合理的期望
5. **能量补充**：找到适合自己的社交充电方式

你最后成功安排了聚会，正是因为你找到了适合自己的社交节奏。这不是社交能力的问题，而是你学会了如何在当前生活阶段有效管理社交能量。

记住：社交不是比赛，而是找到适合自己的平衡点。你的"社交能量管理"方式，正是你独特的生活智慧。

### 思维激发
### 核心变量提取
- 社交能力指数（Social Competency Index）≈ 清晰沟通社交计划并执行的能力
- 生活阶段（Life Phase）≈ 忙碌创造期
- 社交能力下降（Social Competency Drop）≈ 生活阶段 * 2-3点

### 逻辑链条构建
1. 社交能力指数定义：沟通 + 执行 = 社交能力
2. 生活阶段影响：忙碌创造期 → 社交能力下降
3. 自我认知偏差：过去能力 * 当前状态 → 低估当前能力

### 知识精髓提炼
社交能力指数（SCI） = 沟通能力 + 执行力 - 生活阶段影响 * 2-3点
自我认知 ≈ 过去能力 * 当前状态 → 低估当前能力

### 本质思考
让我们从最基本处开始思考"社交能力指数"这个概念的本质。

从演化角度看，社交能力源于人类作为社会性动物的生存需求。在原始部落中，有效沟通和协作是生存的关键。这种能力在演化过程中被保留并发展，成为人类的基本特质。

从矛盾分析，社交能力的主要矛盾在于：个体自我认知与实际表现之间的差距。人们往往高估或低估自己的社交能力，这种认知偏差导致了社交中的诸多问题。

从存在主义视角，社交能力的存在理由是维系社会关系、实现自我价值。它是人类在社会中生存和发展的基本工具。

通过现象学还原，褪去表象，我们看到社交能力的本质是：个体在社会互动中有效表达、理解并回应他人需求的能力。

因此，社交能力指数的本质定义是：衡量个体在社会互动中有效沟通、协调和执行社交计划的能力水平，反映了个体在社会关系中的适应性和效能。

这个定义揭示了社交能力的核心要素：沟通、协调和执行，以及其作为社会适应性的衡量标准。它帮助我们理解为什么在不同生活阶段，人们的社交能力会发生变化，以及如何客观评估和提升自己的社交能力。

### 类比思考
就像一辆车在高速公路上行驶，我们每个人都有一个社交能力的"档位"。有些人天生就是五档，轻松自如；有些人则是三档，略显吃力。但当我们进入人生的"施工区"——忙于事业或家庭时，档位会自动降两档。五档的人变成了三档，三档的人可能就只剩一档了。有趣的是，我们往往还误以为自己仍在原来的档位上，就像司机忘记已经换挡，还在期待同样的速度。但意识到这一点，就像看到仪表盘上的档位显示，能让我们更好地理解彼此，调整期待。最终，当我们找到合适的档位，社交就像顺畅的换挡，变得轻松自然。

### 沉思者
### 现状分析

在这个快节奏的社会里，我们每个人都像是被卷入了一场无休止的马拉松。工作、家庭、社交，各种责任和期待压得我们喘不过气来。尤其是在这个“创造”的阶段，我们都在拼命地往前冲，仿佛停下来就意味着失败。这种忙碌和压力，无形中削弱了我们的社交能力，让我们在与人交往时显得力不从心。

### 个体剖析

你提到的“社交能力指数”这个概念，确实戳中了很多人的痛点。我们每个人都有自己的社交能力基线，但在某些特定的生活阶段，这个指数会大幅下降。比如，你原本是个“五”，但在忙碌的生活中，你可能已经降到了“二”。问题是，我们往往意识不到这一点，还以为自己依然是那个“六”或“七”。这种自我认知的偏差，导致了我们在社交中的种种尴尬和误解。

### 群体透视

从更广泛的社会视角来看，这种现象并不是个例。我们生活在一个高度连接但又极度疏离的时代。社交媒体让我们可以随时随地和他人保持联系，但真正的面对面交流却变得越来越少。我们都在忙着“创造”，忙着追求所谓的成功，却忽略了人与人之间最基本的情感连接。这种社会发展的动力，某种程度上加剧了我们的社交困境。

### 思考整合

综合来看，社交能力的下降并不是我们个人的问题，而是整个社会结构和生活方式的产物。我们都在拼命往前跑，却忘了停下来看看身边的人。你提到的“社交能力指数”提醒我们，需要重新审视自己的社交状态，意识到自己在忙碌生活中的变化。只有这样，我们才能真正理解彼此，找到一种更健康、更平衡的社交方式。

### 金句

“我们都在拼命往前跑，却忘了停下来看看身边的人。”

### 质疑者
让我们用怀疑之锥来解构这个"社交能力指数"理论：

1. **概念定义问题**
   - "社交能力"被狭隘地定义为"制定和履行社交计划的能力"，这忽略了其他重要维度，如共情、倾听、建立深层关系等。
   - 将复杂的人类社交能力简化为1-10的线性评分，可能过度简化了现实。

2. **假设的合理性**
   - 认为"忙碌时期社交能力会下降2-3分"这一论断缺乏实证支持。
   - 假设人们无法准确评估自己的社交能力，这本身也需要验证。

3. **逻辑推理漏洞**
   - 从"忙碌"直接推导出"社交能力下降"，忽略了个人差异和适应能力。
   - 将社交困难归因于"能力指数下降"，可能忽视了其他因素，如优先级选择或个人偏好。

4. **实践中的矛盾**
   - 对话最后展现的轻松社交互动，与理论中描述的"能力下降"形成鲜明对比。
   - 这种自相矛盾表明，该理论可能无法全面解释现实中的社交现象。

5. **建设性建议**
   - 建议采用更全面、多维度的社交能力评估框架。
   - 考虑将环境因素、个人发展阶段等纳入分析，而非简单归因于"能力指数"。
   - 重视个体差异，避免将复杂的人类社交行为过度简化为线性评分。

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们不仅识别了理论中的问题，也为更深入理解社交能力提供了新的思考方向。
