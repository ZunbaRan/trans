分析结果：
从广告信息的本质来看，这段话的核心目的是引导听众访问特定网站。我们可以用"钓鱼"来类比：

就像钓鱼时用诱饵吸引鱼一样，这段话先用"支持NPR"和"改善世界"这样吸引人的信息作为诱饵，最终目的是让听众"上钩"——访问lemelson.org这个网站。

这个观察角度揭示了广告传播的基本原理：用有价值的信息吸引注意力，最终导向特定行动。就像钓鱼时鱼饵和鱼钩的关系，表面上是提供价值，实则是引导行为。

主题：节目开场与主持人介绍 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P1] [SPEAKER_04]: This is The Indicator from Planet Money.
[P2] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm Darian Woods.
[P3] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm Waylon Wong, and it is Jobs Friday.

分析结果：
从时间尺度转换的视角来看，"Jobs Friday"这个说法其实很有趣。如果我们把时间尺度放大到整个工作史，会发现：

1. 原始社会：工作就是生存，没有固定时间概念
2. 农业时代：工作随季节变化，日出而作日落而息
3. 工业革命：出现了固定工作时间，"朝九晚五"成为常态
4. 信息时代：工作时间变得模糊，随时随地都可能工作

而"Jobs Friday"这个概念，实际上是把宏观经济数据（就业报告）与日常生活节奏（周五）结合在了一起。这种将复杂经济指标与普通人生活节奏挂钩的方式，让原本晦涩的经济数据变得亲切易懂。

从系统思维的角度看，这反映了现代社会中，经济数据与个人生活的紧密联系。一份就业报告，可能影响股市波动，进而影响每个人的投资决策，甚至影响周五晚上的消费计划。

所以，"Jobs Friday"不仅仅是一个播客节目的固定环节，更是现代经济生活的一个缩影，体现了宏观经济与个人生活的微妙联系。

主题：美国就业市场最新数据 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P4] [SPEAKER_02]: The latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the economy added 143,000 jobs in January.
[P5] [SPEAKER_02]: The unemployment rate nudged down a tiny bit from December to 4%.

分析结果：
让我们换个角度看看这组数据：

如果把美国劳动力市场比作一个巨大的餐厅，那么新增的143,000个工作岗位就像是餐厅新添了143,000张椅子。而4%的失业率意味着，在餐厅里每100张椅子中，只有4张是空着的。

这个视角告诉我们：
1. 餐厅的座位（工作岗位）在持续增加，说明经济在扩张
2. 空座率（失业率）很低，说明劳动力市场接近饱和
3. 餐厅需要不断翻新（产业升级）来吸引更多食客（人才）

这个简单的比喻让我们直观地理解了复杂的就业数据背后的经济状况。

[P111] [SPEAKER_02]: The federal judge who paused the buyout program is scheduled to hear arguments next week.
[P112] [SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, a separate but similar resignation offer has gone out to employees at the CIA.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**系统思维**  
将这两个事件放在更大的系统中观察，会发现它们都是组织内部“人员调整”策略的一部分。无论是暂停的买断计划还是CIA的辞职提议，核心都是组织在应对某种压力或变化时，试图通过人员流动来优化结构或降低成本。

### 解决步骤：  
1. **理解背景**：分析导致这些举措的外部压力（如预算削减、战略调整等）。  
2. **评估影响**：预测这些举措对组织效率和员工士气的短期与长期影响。  
3. **寻找替代方案**：探索其他可能更温和或更有效的人员调整方式，例如内部转岗或技能再培训。  
4. **沟通透明**：确保员工理解这些举措的原因和目的，减少不确定性和恐慌。  

通过这种系统化的视角，可以更清晰地理解这些事件的本质，并找到更平衡的解决方案。

[P20] [SPEAKER_05]: Visit WISE.com.
[P21] [SPEAKER_05]: TNCs apply.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**“货币转换的透明化革命”**

WISE 的出现，就像是在货币转换的迷宫中点亮了一盏明灯。它通过提供中间市场汇率，直接切中了传统跨境支付中的痛点——隐藏费用。这种透明化的做法，不仅简化了用户的计算过程，还让每一分钱都花得明明白白。

### 解决步骤：
1. **识别问题**：传统跨境支付中隐藏费用多，用户难以准确计算实际成本。
2. **提供解决方案**：WISE 使用中间市场汇率，避免了传统银行或支付平台的加价。
3. **简化流程**：用户只需关注汇率，无需担心额外费用，操作更直观。
4. **扩大选择**：支持多达 40 种货币转换，满足多样化需求。
5. **透明化信息**：明确告知条款和条件（TNCs），避免用户误解。

### 结论：
WISE 通过透明化和简化，重新定义了跨境支付的用户体验。它让货币转换变得像本地支付一样简单，真正做到了“让钱无国界”。

[P103] [SPEAKER_01]: I love my job.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely devoted to being a public servant in the National Park Service, and I'm going to keep telling the stories and doing the work that I believe in until I can't do it anymore.
[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.
[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.

分析结果：
### 独特观察角度：**"生态系统视角"**

将国家公园服务局看作一个生态系统，每个员工都是这个系统中的关键物种。如果某些关键物种（如负责薪资管理或游客中心清洁的员工）数量骤减，整个生态系统将面临崩溃的风险。就像在自然界中，失去蜜蜂会导致植物授粉困难，进而影响整个食物链。

### 解决步骤：
1. **识别关键角色**：明确哪些职位是不可或缺的，如薪资管理员和清洁工。
2. **预防流失**：通过提高工作满意度、提供职业发展机会等措施，减少关键岗位员工的流失。
3. **建立后备力量**：培养多技能员工，确保在关键岗位人员流失时，有其他人可以迅速填补空缺。
4. **系统监控**：定期评估员工流失率，及时发现并解决潜在问题。

通过这种生态系统视角，可以更全面地理解和解决国家公园服务局可能面临的人力资源危机。

4. **历史对比**：
   - 将2022年Twitter员工收到的备忘录与“岔路口”邮件进行对比，可以发现两者在标题选择上的相似性。这种相似性不仅体现在文字上，更体现在其背后的决策和变革意图上。

### 结论：

通过“岔路口”这一标题，信息发布者巧妙地利用了隐喻的力量，不仅传达了当前的关键决策点，还激发了读者的情感共鸣和行动导向。这种标题选择策略在组织变革和重大决策中具有显著的沟通效果。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个信息。从演化角度看，基金会支持广播节目是一种现代形式的赞助行为，其源头可以追溯到文艺复兴时期艺术家的赞助制度。矛盾分析显示，这里存在的主要矛盾是创新需求与资源支持之间的张力。存在主义视角下，这种支持行为的根本理由在于人类对进步和改善的永恒追求。通过现象学还原，褪去表象，我们看到其本质是一种知识传播和价值传递的机制。因此，这属于一种现代教育传播活动，其种差在于通过创新基金支持特定主题的公共广播节目。

[P87] [SPEAKER_02]: The company, now known as X, is reportedly facing lawsuits from thousands of former employees who say that, among other things, they didn't get the severance package they were promised.

分析结果：
### 从"时间尺度"看Twitter风波

**放大视角：** 把Twitter的现状放在科技行业发展的长河中观察

**关键发现：** 这不是第一次科技巨头因裁员引发争议，也不会是最后一次

**类比案例：** 2000年互联网泡沫破裂时，雅虎等公司也经历了类似风波

**简化本质：** 科技行业的周期性波动导致企业不得不做出艰难决定

**独特视角：** 与其纠结于当下的纠纷，不如思考如何建立更灵活的用工制度来应对行业波动

**解决思路：**
1. 建立动态薪酬体系，将部分收入与公司业绩挂钩
2. 推行股权激励，让员工与公司利益更紧密绑定
3. 完善裁员补偿机制，设立"缓冲期"和"转岗计划"
4. 加强行业自律，制定统一的裁员补偿标准

**核心观点：** 在科技行业快速迭代的背景下，企业和员工都需要建立"抗波动"能力，而不是在每次危机来临时陷入无休止的纠纷。

[P13] [SPEAKER_02]: Just yesterday, a federal judge paused the offer until at least Monday of next week.
[P14] [SPEAKER_02]: Today on the show, an employment lawyer walks us through the government's deal, which has plunged the federal workforce into confusion and uncertainty.
[P15] [SPEAKER_02]: And we talked to some of those government employees about how they've been weighing this critical decision to stay or go.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**时间尺度转换**

将问题放在一个更长的时间尺度上观察，可以简化复杂性。具体步骤如下：

1. **短期视角**：当前的法律暂停和不确定性确实让联邦雇员感到困惑和压力。
2. **中期视角**：无论法官的裁决如何，联邦政府最终需要解决员工去留问题，以确保公共服务不中断。
3. **长期视角**：这次事件可能会促使政府重新审视和优化其雇佣政策，减少未来类似情况的发生。

### 解决步骤

1. **短期应对**：联邦雇员可以利用这段时间收集更多信息，咨询法律专家，评估个人和家庭的长远利益。
2. **中期规划**：政府应尽快明确政策方向，提供清晰的指导，减少员工的不确定性。
3. **长期改进**：通过这次事件，政府可以总结经验，改进雇佣合同和政策，避免未来出现类似的混乱局面。

通过这种时间尺度的转换，问题从当前的混乱中抽离出来，变得更加清晰和可管理。

分析结果：
让我们换个角度思考这个问题：疫苗与自闭症的关联，本质上是一个信息传播的"病毒"问题。就像计算机病毒一旦植入系统就很难彻底清除，这个谣言也深深植入了公众的认知系统。

解决之道不在于用更多研究去"杀毒"，而在于重建整个"操作系统"——改变公众获取和评估健康信息的机制。比如，可以借鉴社交媒体的算法推荐，但将其用于传播科学证据；或者像"维基百科"那样，建立众包式的疫苗信息验证平台。

关键在于，与其试图"删除"错误信息，不如用更吸引人的方式"覆盖"它。就像在互联网时代，我们不是去消灭谣言，而是用更有趣、更易传播的真实信息来占领注意力市场。

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
让我们换个角度思考这个问题：如果把联邦政府想象成一个大型企业，特朗普政府的行为就像是一次大规模的企业重组。从商业角度来看，这种"买断裁员"策略其实是一种典型的成本控制手段。

类比一下：当一家公司面临运营压力时，通常会采取两种方式：一是直接裁员，二是提供自愿离职计划。特朗普政府选择了后者，这其实是一种更温和、成本更低的重组方式。通过让员工提前退休或自愿离职，政府避免了直接裁员带来的法律风险和负面舆论。

从系统思维的角度看，这种做法的好处是：
1. 短期内节省了大量人力成本
2. 避免了直接裁员可能引发的社会动荡
3. 为政府机构的重组和优化创造了空间

但这种做法也存在潜在风险：
1. 可能导致关键岗位人才流失
2. 影响政府服务的连续性和质量
3. 长期来看，可能影响政府机构的专业能力

总的来说，这就像是在下一盘大棋：用短期的成本换取长期的效率提升，但需要在裁员和保留关键能力之间找到平衡点。

[P102] [SPEAKER_04]: The other employee we talked to, the museum curator at the National Park Service, said she never considered quitting.
[P103] [SPEAKER_01]: I love my job.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely devoted to being a public servant in the National Park Service, and I'm going to keep telling the stories and doing the work that I believe in until I can't do it anymore.
[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.
[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **员工忠诚度** ≈ 对工作的热爱 + 对公共服务的奉献
2. **机构功能** = 行政管理 + 公共服务
3. **人员流失影响** → 机构功能受损

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **员工态度**：[SPEAKER_04]提到博物馆馆长从未考虑过辞职，[SPEAKER_01]表示热爱工作并完全奉献于公共服务。
   - 热爱工作 + 奉献 = 高忠诚度
2. **机构功能**：[SPEAKER_02]提到如果机构失去大量员工，可能无法完成工资管理或清洁游客中心等基本任务。
   - 人员流失 → 行政管理功能受损
   - 人员流失 → 公共服务功能受损
3. **联邦员工角色**：[SPEAKER_02]强调联邦员工不仅是保管者，还负责确保纳税人获得退税。
   - 联邦员工 = 保管者 + 税务管理者

### 知识精髓提炼
**核心洞察**：员工忠诚度（热爱 + 奉献）是维持机构功能（行政管理 + 公共服务）的关键因素。人员流失会导致机构功能受损，影响从工资管理到游客服务的各个方面。联邦员工的多重角色（保管者 + 税务管理者）进一步凸显了他们在公共服务中的重要性。

**文字关系式**：
员工忠诚度 ≈ 热爱 * 奉献
机构功能 = 行政管理 + 公共服务
人员流失 → 机构功能 ÷ 效率
联邦员工 = 保管者 + 税务管理者

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个现象的本质。从演化角度看，这种买断计划源于组织对人力资源配置的重新考量，反映了组织在特定历史时期的战略调整。其主要矛盾在于组织效率与员工权益之间的平衡。从存在主义视角，这种计划的存在源于组织对变革的需求，以及员工对职业发展的重新定位。通过现象学还原，我们可以看到其本质是一种组织与个体之间的契约重构。因此，这种买断计划的属是人力资源管理制度，种差则是通过经济补偿实现人员自愿离职的特殊安排。

[P86] [SPEAKER_02]: There's also the cautionary tale of Twitter, the last organization to get Elon Musk's fork in the road memo.
[P87] [SPEAKER_02]: The company, now known as X, is reportedly facing lawsuits from thousands of former employees who say that, among other things, they didn't get the severance package they were promised.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **Twitter ≈ X**：公司名称变更
2. **Elon Musk → fork in the road memo**：关键决策点
3. **former employees ≈ lawsuits**：员工与法律纠纷
4. **severance package ≈ promised**：承诺与未兑现

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **Twitter → X**：公司名称变更，可能伴随战略或结构变化
2. **Elon Musk → fork in the road memo**：关键决策点，可能影响公司方向
3. **former employees → lawsuits**：员工因未获得承诺的遣散费而提起诉讼
4. **severance package ≈ promised**：承诺的遣散费未兑现，导致法律纠纷

### 知识精髓提炼
Twitter（现为X）在Elon Musk的关键决策后，面临数千名前员工的法律诉讼，主要原因是未兑现承诺的遣散费。这表明公司变革可能引发内部管理和法律问题。

[P4] [SPEAKER_02]: The latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the economy added 143,000 jobs in January.
[P5] [SPEAKER_02]: The unemployment rate nudged down a tiny bit from December to 4%.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考"就业"这个概念的本质。

1. 演化分析：从狩猎采集时代的生存必需，到农业社会的分工，再到工业革命后的雇佣关系，就业始终是人类获取生存资源的基本方式。

2. 矛盾分析：就业的主要矛盾在于个体生存需求与社会生产需求之间的平衡。个人需要工作维持生计，社会需要劳动力维持运转。

3. 存在理由：就业之所以存在，源于人类社会的分工协作本质。它既是个人实现自我价值的途径，也是社会维持运转的基础。

4. 本质还原：褪去薪资、职位等表象，就业的本质是个人劳动与社会需求的交换关系。

5. 属和种差：就业是（属）一种经济活动，（种差）其特点是个体通过提供劳动换取生存资源，同时满足社会生产需求。

因此，就业数据的变动不仅反映了经济状况，更揭示了社会交换关系的动态平衡。

[P108] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says in his experience, the vast majority of federal employees are dedicated to their mission.
[P109] [SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.
[P110] [SPEAKER_06]: But possible byproduct of the Trump administration's designs to thin out the federal workforce is that people may begin to understand firsthand what happens when you gut the federal government.

分析结果：
让我们换个角度思考这个问题：把政府比作人体，公务员就是细胞。用斧头砍和用手术刀切的区别，就像是用大锤砸身体和精准手术的区别。大锤可能伤及无辜细胞，而手术刀则能精准切除病灶。特朗普政府想要精简联邦机构，就像是想给臃肿的身体减肥。但问题是，我们得先搞清楚哪些是脂肪，哪些是肌肉。过度减肥可能会让身体虚弱，就像过度裁员可能会影响政府职能。也许更好的办法是找到那个平衡点，既保持健康，又不会营养不良。

[P3] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm Waylon Wong, and it is Jobs Friday.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。"Jobs Friday"这一概念的本质是什么？

从演化角度看，Jobs Friday起源于美国劳工统计局定期发布就业报告的传统，这一惯例逐渐演变成媒体和经济界关注的重要事件。其核心功能是提供就业市场的最新数据，作为经济健康状况的晴雨表。

从矛盾分析来看，Jobs Friday体现了信息透明度与市场波动之间的张力。一方面，它提供了客观数据；另一方面，这些数据可能引发市场过度反应。

从存在主义视角，Jobs Friday存在的理由在于满足社会对经济信息的需求，为决策提供依据。它的前提是就业数据对经济具有重要指示意义。

通过现象学还原，褪去媒体炒作和仪式化特征，Jobs Friday的本质是定期发布就业统计数据的信息传播机制。

属和种差定义：Jobs Friday是一种定期发布就业统计数据的媒体事件，其特点是固定时间发布、关注就业市场、引发广泛讨论。

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
### 简化视角：**"邮件辞职"背后的法律迷宫**

#### 核心问题
联邦政府通过邮件接受辞职的提议，引发了一系列法律和财务上的疑问。

#### 关键点
1. **资金来源**：
   - 总统有权指导联邦机构，但国会负责支付工资和福利。
   - 当前联邦机构的资金只到3月中旬，之后需要新的拨款法案。

2. **行政休假期限**：
   - 现有法律规定，行政休假不得超过10天，除非有特定理由。
   - 提议中的休假是否合法，尚不明确。

3. **法律授权**：
   - 这种提议没有先例，是否合法实施存在疑问。
   - 人事管理办公室认为法规可以解释为允许这种延长的行政休假，但律师和工会对此表示怀疑。

#### 解决步骤
1. **明确资金来源**：
   - 确保国会批准必要的拨款，以支付辞职员工的工资和福利。

2. **澄清休假期限**：
   - 制定明确的规则，说明在何种情况下可以延长行政休假。

3. **法律审查**：
   - 由独立的法律专家审查提议的合法性，确保其符合现有法律。

4. **沟通与透明度**：
   - 向联邦员工提供清晰的信息，减少混淆和不确定性。

通过以上步骤，可以在法律和财务上确保提议的合法性和可行性，同时保护联邦员工的权益。

[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.

分析结果：
### 独特观察角度：**"职场生存指南"**

从这段对话中，我们可以看到一个典型的职场困境：员工在面临组织变动时的无奈与挣扎。但换个角度，这其实是一个“职场生存指南”的绝佳案例。以下是几个关键点：

1. **匿名保护**：博物馆馆长要求匿名，这提醒我们在职场中，保护自己的身份和隐私至关重要，尤其是在敏感时期。

2. **高层态度**：高层希望员工离开，这表明在职场中，了解上层的真实意图和态度是生存的关键。有时候，表面的友好可能掩盖着深层的意图。

3. **政策解读**：人事管理办公室发布的FAQ，表面上是在提供“福利”，实际上可能是在暗示员工离开。这提醒我们，政策文件背后的潜台词同样重要，需要仔细解读。

4. **职业选择**：FAQ鼓励员工寻找私营部门的工作，这暗示了公共部门的不稳定性。在职场中，时刻保持对市场动态的敏感，做好职业规划，是应对不确定性的重要策略。

5. **家庭责任**：员工提到有家庭要支持，这强调了在职场决策中，个人和家庭的责任感是不可忽视的因素。职场生存不仅仅是个人发展，更是对家庭的责任。

### 总结：
职场如战场，了解规则、解读潜台词、保护自己、规划未来，是每个职场人必备的技能。这段对话不仅揭示了职场的复杂性，更是一本生动的“职场生存指南”。

[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

分析结果：
### 简化视角：**机会成本与风险权衡**

这位司法部的临时员工面临一个典型的决策困境：是继续留在当前职位，还是选择离开。我们可以从**机会成本**和**风险权衡**的角度来简化这个问题。

#### 1. **机会成本**
- **留下**：她可能获得8个月的工作经验和潜在的薪资提升，但如果被裁，这些都将化为乌有。
- **离开**：她将失去这些潜在收益，但可以立即寻找其他机会，避免不确定性带来的焦虑。

#### 2. **风险权衡**
- **留下**：面临被裁的风险，可能一无所获。
- **离开**：主动放弃当前职位，但可以避免被动被裁的尴尬和不确定性。

#### 3. **决策建议**
- **短期视角**：如果她更看重短期稳定性和避免风险，离开可能是更安全的选择。
- **长期视角**：如果她愿意承担风险，并且认为完成试用期后的收益（如薪资提升和职业发展）值得冒险，那么留下可能更有利。

#### 4. **行动步骤**
1. **评估风险承受能力**：她需要评估自己对风险的承受能力，以及被裁后是否有其他备选方案。
2. **咨询导师或职业顾问**：寻求外部建议，帮助她更清晰地看待当前局势。
3. **制定备选计划**：无论选择留下还是离开，都应制定一个备选计划，以应对可能的最坏情况。

通过这种简化视角，她可以更清晰地权衡利弊，做出最适合自己的决策。

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **联邦劳动力** ≈ 3百万员工
2. **特朗普政府目标** → 缩小联邦劳动力规模
3. **策略** = 强制解散机构 + 提供离职补偿

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **现状**：联邦劳动力 ≈ 3百万员工（包括外交官、护士、医生、清洁工、动物学家等）
2. **目标**：特朗普政府 → 缩小联邦劳动力规模
3. **手段**：
   - 强制解散机构 → 减少职位
   - 提供离职补偿 → 激励员工自愿离职
4. **补偿条款**：员工可领取工资和福利至9月，无需工作

### 知识精髓提炼
联邦劳动力规模（3百万）→ 特朗普政府目标（缩小规模）→ 策略（强制解散 + 离职补偿）→ 补偿条款（工资福利至9月）

[P108] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says in his experience, the vast majority of federal employees are dedicated to their mission.
[P109] [SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.
[P110] [SPEAKER_06]: But possible byproduct of the Trump administration's designs to thin out the federal workforce is that people may begin to understand firsthand what happens when you gut the federal government.

分析结果：
核心变量提取：
- 政府工作方式 ≈ 斧头 vs 手术刀
- 联邦员工 ≈ 使命 + 奉献
- 特朗普政府 ≈ 削减联邦劳动力
- 结果 ≈ 公众理解 + 政府职能

逻辑链条构建：
政府工作方式（斧头 vs 手术刀）→ 联邦员工（使命 + 奉献）↔ 特朗普政府（削减联邦劳动力）→ 结果（公众理解 + 政府职能）

知识精髓提炼：
粗暴的政府工作方式（斧头）会削弱联邦员工的奉献精神，而特朗普政府的削减政策可能导致公众更直观地理解政府职能的重要性。

主题：联邦政府裁员计划的具体实施 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**"裁员"的另一种解读——组织自我更新的机会**

#### 1. **尺度转换**
- **宏观视角**：从国家整体来看，政府机构的精简是为了提高整体效率和响应速度。这不仅仅是裁员，而是对国家治理体系的一次优化。
- **微观视角**：对个人而言，这可能是职业生涯的一个转折点，提供了一个重新评估职业目标和技能的机会。

#### 2. **跨界思维**
- **类比企业重组**：就像企业在市场竞争中不断调整结构以保持竞争力，政府机构也需要通过精简来提高效能。这类似于企业的“瘦身计划”，旨在去除冗余，提升核心业务能力。

#### 3. **极限思考**
- **极端情况**：如果政府完全不进行任何调整，长期的低效和冗余可能会导致更大的财政负担和公众信任危机。通过主动调整，可以避免未来更剧烈的变革。

#### 4. **系统思维**
- **整体系统**：政府机构是一个复杂的系统，每个部门都与其他部门相互关联。通过精简，可以优化资源配置，使得整个系统更加协调和高效。

#### 5. **逆向思考**
- **反面思考**：如果不进行精简，政府机构可能会继续膨胀，导致更多的资源浪费和效率低下。通过主动调整，可以避免未来更大的问题。

#### 6. **简化思维**
- **核心要素**：问题的核心在于如何提高政府机构的效率和响应速度。通过精简，可以去除不必要的层级和冗余，使得决策更加迅速和有效。

#### 7. **历史视角**
- **历史经验**：历史上，许多国家和企业都通过精简和重组来应对危机和提高竞争力。例如，上世纪80年代英国撒切尔政府的公共部门改革，通过精简机构提高了政府效率。

#### 8. **跳出框架**
- **重新定义问题**：这不仅仅是裁员，而是一次组织自我更新的机会。通过主动调整，政府机构可以更好地适应未来的挑战和需求。

### 解决步骤
1. **评估现状**：全面评估当前政府机构的效率和冗余情况。
2. **制定计划**：制定详细的精简计划，明确目标和步骤。
3. **沟通透明**：与员工进行充分沟通，解释调整的必要性和具体安排。
4. **提供支持**：为受影响的员工提供职业转型支持和培训机会。
5. **持续优化**：在实施过程中不断评估和调整，确保达到预期效果。

通过这个独特的视角，我们可以看到，政府机构的精简不仅仅是为了减少开支，更是为了提高整体效能和适应未来的挑战。这为国家和个人都提供了一个自我更新和提升的机会。

[P121] [SPEAKER_08]: On the ThruLine podcast, the myth linking autism and vaccines was decades in the making and was a major moment for vaccine hesitancy in America, tapping into fears involving the pharmaceutical industry and the federal government.
[P122] [SPEAKER_03]: No matter how many studies you do showing that this is not a problem, it's very hard to unring the bell.
[P123] [SPEAKER_08]: Listen to ThruLine from NPR wherever you get your podcasts.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个现象的本质。

从演化分析来看，疫苗与自闭症的错误关联源于人类对未知的恐惧和对复杂系统的不信任。这种恐惧在信息传播中不断被放大和强化。

矛盾分析揭示了主要矛盾：科学证据与公众认知之间的鸿沟。尽管大量研究证明疫苗的安全性，但人们更倾向于相信个人化的故事和阴谋论。

从存在主义视角，这种错误信念的存在源于人类对控制感的渴望。在无法完全理解的事物面前，人们倾向于寻找简单的因果解释。

通过现象学还原，褪去表象后，我们看到本质上是信息传播机制与人类认知局限之间的矛盾。即使错误信息被纠正，其影响依然存在。

因此，这本质上是一个关于科学传播与公众认知之间鸿沟的问题，其核心在于如何建立有效的科学传播机制，以克服人类认知的局限性。

[P102] [SPEAKER_04]: The other employee we talked to, the museum curator at the National Park Service, said she never considered quitting.
[P103] [SPEAKER_01]: I love my job.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely devoted to being a public servant in the National Park Service, and I'm going to keep telling the stories and doing the work that I believe in until I can't do it anymore.
[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.
[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。工作忠诚度的本质是什么？

1. 演化分析：从原始社会的分工协作，到现代社会的职业选择，人类对工作的态度经历了从生存必需到价值实现的转变。不变的内核是人对意义感的追求。

2. 矛盾分析：工作忠诚度存在的主要矛盾是个人价值实现与组织需求之间的张力。当个人信念与组织使命高度契合时，忠诚度达到峰值。

3. 存在理由：工作忠诚度存在的理由是人对归属感和意义感的内在需求。它源于人类作为社会性动物的本质属性。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，工作忠诚度的本质是个人价值观与组织使命的深度契合，是一种基于认同的持续投入状态。

5. 属和种差：工作忠诚度（属）是一种基于价值认同的持续投入状态（种差），它体现了个人与组织在使命和价值观层面的深度契合。

表象之下，我们看到的是人类对意义感的永恒追求，以及个人与组织在价值层面的深度共鸣。这一切真的如我们所见吗？或许，工作忠诚度的本质，正是人类在寻找生命意义过程中的一种存在方式。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个"岔路口"的比喻。从演化角度看，岔路口这个概念可以追溯到人类最早需要做出选择的时刻，它象征着决策点的本质。矛盾分析显示，岔路口的核心矛盾在于确定性与不确定性之间 - 我们既渴望明确的方向，又必须面对未知的可能。从存在主义视角，岔路口之所以存在，是因为人类具有自由意志和选择能力。通过现象学还原，我们褪去具体的邮件和事件，发现"岔路口"的本质是一个决策时刻的隐喻。因此，属和种差的定义是：岔路口是一个象征性的决策点，其本质特征在于需要在不确定的未来路径中做出选择。

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **Work Management Platforms** ≈ 工作管理平台
2. **Red Tape + Endless Adoption Time + IT Bottlenecks** ≈ 繁琐流程 + 漫长采用时间 + IT瓶颈
3. **Nobody Really Uses Them** ≈ 实际使用率低
4. **Monday.com** ≈ 高效、灵活的工作管理平台
5. **No Admin Middleman** ≈ 无管理员中介

[P15] [SPEAKER_02]: And we talked to some of those government employees about how they've been weighing this critical decision to stay or go.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个法律问题的本质。

1. 演化分析：法律的核心在于维护社会秩序和公平正义，从最初的部落规则到现代法律体系，其不变的内核是对人类行为的规范。

2. 矛盾分析：这里存在的主要矛盾是政府政策与法律规范之间的冲突，以及个人利益与集体利益之间的张力。

3. 存在理由：法律之所以存在，是为了在复杂的社会关系中建立可预测的行为准则，保护公民权利，维护社会秩序。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，这个问题的本质在于：在特定社会契约下，个人选择与集体规范之间的平衡点在哪里？

5. 属和种差：法律是（属）一套强制性的社会规范，（种差）其特点是由国家制定并强制执行，旨在维护社会秩序和公平正义。

表象之下，我们看到的不仅是一个具体的法律问题，更是个人自由与社会规范之间永恒的张力和平衡。这一切真的如我们所见吗？或许更深层的本质在于：在复杂的社会系统中，如何找到个人与集体利益的最佳平衡点。

输入内容：
[P86] [SPEAKER_02]: There's also the cautionary tale of Twitter, the last organization to get Elon Musk's fork in the road memo.
[P87] [SPEAKER_02]: The company, now known as X, is reportedly facing lawsuits from thousands of former employees who say that, among other things, they didn't get the severance package they were promised.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个案例的本质。表象之下，我们看到了一个关于企业治理与员工权益的深层矛盾。

从演化分析来看，企业并购与重组是资本主义经济中的常态，但其核心始终围绕着权力与利益的再分配。Twitter被收购后更名为X，这一行为本身就暗示着对原有企业文化的否定与重构。

矛盾分析揭示了主要矛盾：资本意志与员工权益的冲突。马斯克作为资本方，追求效率与变革，而员工则期待契约精神的延续。这种矛盾在裁员补偿问题上集中爆发。

从存在主义视角看，企业并购的存在前提是资本的扩张需求，但这种扩张往往以牺牲个体利益为代价。被裁员工的存在价值被资本逻辑所否定，这引发了法律层面的对抗。

通过现象学还原，我们褪去企业并购、品牌重塑等表象，看到的是现代社会中资本与劳动关系的本质：一种不对等的权力结构。

因此，这个案例的本质可以定义为：在资本主义经济体系中，资本扩张与个体权益保障之间的结构性矛盾，通过企业并购这一具体形式得以显现。

属：社会矛盾
种差：资本扩张与个体权益保障之间的结构性矛盾

主题：联邦雇员对裁员计划的反应 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P48] [SPEAKER_02]: One of those employees works at the National Park Service as a museum curator.
[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **National Park Service employee ≈ anonymity + job security**
2. **Office of Personnel Management FAQ ≈ resignation + vacation + private sector jobs**
3. **Employee sentiment ≈ frustration + family support + disconnect**

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **Employee anonymity ↔ job security**: The museum curator's request for anonymity highlights the importance of job security in the National Park Service.
2. **FAQ content → employee frustration**: The FAQ's suggestion to take a vacation or find a private sector job implies a lack of understanding of the employees' needs and responsibilities.
3. **Employee sentiment ↔ disconnect**: The employees' frustration and need to support their families indicate a significant disconnect between the management's perspective and the employees' reality.

### 知识精髓提炼
**FAQ content * disconnect = employee frustration**: The Office of Personnel Management's FAQ, which suggests taking a vacation or finding a private sector job, reflects a profound disconnect from the employees' actual needs and responsibilities, leading to significant frustration among the workforce.

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - essence

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。联邦政府工作人员这一概念的本质是什么？

从演化分析来看，政府工作人员的出现源于社会分工和公共事务管理的需要。随着社会发展，这一群体从最初的简单行政人员演变为包含各种专业技能的复杂体系。

矛盾分析揭示出，政府工作人员面临的主要矛盾是公共服务需求与行政效率之间的张力。一方面需要确保公共服务的连续性和专业性，另一方面又面临机构臃肿和效率低下的批评。

从存在主义视角看，政府工作人员的存在理由在于维持社会秩序和提供公共服务。他们的存在前提是现代社会对专业化公共管理的需求。

通过现象学还原，褪去各种表象，我们看到政府工作人员的本质是公共服务的执行者，是社会契约的具体体现。

因此，政府工作人员的属和种差定义是：受雇于政府机构，以执行公共事务管理为主要职责的专业化群体。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。政府工作力量的本质是什么？

从演化分析来看，政府工作力量源于社会分工和公共事务管理的需要。其核心功能是执行公共政策，维护社会秩序，提供公共服务。

主要矛盾在于：政府工作力量既要高效执行政策，又要保持灵活应变；既要精简机构，又要确保服务质量。

从存在主义视角，政府工作力量存在的理由在于：它是社会契约的具体体现，是连接国家意志与公民生活的纽带。

通过现象学还原，我们剥离表象，发现政府工作力量的本质是：公共利益的守护者和执行者，是社会运转不可或缺的机制。

因此，政府工作力量可定义为：以公共利益为导向，通过专业化分工来执行公共政策和提供公共服务的组织体系。

[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.

主题：法律专家对裁员计划的质疑 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **政府提议** ≈ 联邦雇员通过发送主题为“辞职”的邮件接受提议
2. **法律授权** ↔ 总统有权指导联邦机构，但国会负责支付工资
3. **资金问题** → 当前联邦机构资金仅支持到3月中旬
4. **行政休假** ≈ 接受提议后，雇员将处于行政休假状态，现有法律限制为10天
5. **法律争议** ↔ 就业律师和工会质疑提议的合法性和可信度

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **提议机制**：联邦雇员通过发送特定主题的邮件接受政府提议，这一机制在联邦就业法律中无先例。
2. **法律授权**：总统有权指导联邦机构，但支付工资的权限在国会，当前资金仅支持到3月中旬。
3. **资金问题**：如果国会拨款中断，辞职雇员将在拨款恢复后获得补发工资，但不同机构的条款增加了雇员的困惑。
4. **行政休假**：接受提议后，雇员将处于行政休假状态，现有法律限制为10天，除非有特定理由。
5. **法律争议**：就业律师和工会质疑提议的合法性和可信度，认为超过10天的行政休假支付可能未经授权且违法。

### 知识精髓提炼
政府提议的核心机制是通过邮件接受辞职，但涉及的法律授权、资金问题和行政休假限制引发了广泛的法律争议和质疑。核心问题在于提议的合法性和可信度，尤其是在资金支持和行政休假期限方面。

[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - analogy

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
"就像园丁突然决定要修剪一棵大树，不是小心翼翼地剪去枯枝，而是直接砍掉整根枝干，甚至不惜动摇树根。联邦政府这棵大树，正经历一场前所未有的'修剪'，有的枝条被连根拔起，有的则被鼓励自行脱落。园丁许诺，主动脱落的枝条还能继续汲取养分直到秋天，但大树的形态已经悄然改变。"

主题：广告插播：Lemelson基金会 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P124] [SPEAKER_05]: Support for NPR and the following message come from the Lemelson Foundation, working to harness the power of invention and innovation to accelerate climate action and improve lives around the world.
[P125] [SPEAKER_05]: Learn more at lemelson.org.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个看似美好的公益广告背后隐藏着什么。

现状分析：我们生活在一个科技飞速发展的时代，各大基金会纷纷打出“创新”、“气候行动”等高大上的旗号，试图塑造自己拯救世界的形象。但仔细想想，这些口号背后，究竟有多少是真实的行动，又有多少是精心设计的公关策略？

个体剖析：Lemelson基金会声称要“利用发明的力量来加速气候行动”，这听起来很美好。但让我们抛开表面的光环，看看他们真正在做什么。他们所谓的“创新”，是否只是为了一些大企业服务，让它们继续在环保的幌子下牟取暴利？他们所谓的“改善生活”，是否只是让一小部分人受益，而大多数人依然在贫困和污染中挣扎？

群体透视：在这个网络连接的时代，信息传播的速度前所未有地快。但这也意味着，虚假的宣传和误导性的信息可以迅速扩散。Lemelson基金会通过NPR这样的主流媒体平台发声，看似在传播正能量，但实际上，他们是否在利用这些平台来掩盖自己的真实目的？他们所谓的“气候行动”，是否只是为了让公众忽视那些真正需要解决的深层次问题？

思考整合：我们不能被这些光鲜亮丽的口号所迷惑。真正的创新和气候行动，应该是以人为本，关注每一个个体的福祉，而不是为了一些大企业和基金会的利益。我们需要更多的透明度和问责制，确保这些所谓的“公益”项目真正能够带来实质性的改变，而不是成为另一种形式的剥削和欺骗。

所以，下次当你听到这些高大上的口号时，不妨多问一句：这背后到底隐藏着什么？

主题：联邦雇员对裁员计划的反应 - essence

输入内容：
[P48] [SPEAKER_02]: One of those employees works at the National Park Service as a museum curator.
[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段对话揭示了组织管理中的本质矛盾：

1. 演化分析：从传统的官僚制到现代管理理念，组织与员工的关系始终存在权力与利益的博弈。这种矛盾在公共部门尤为突出。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾体现在组织目标与个人需求的冲突。管理者追求效率与成本控制，而员工则关注生计与发展。

3. 存在理由：这种矛盾的存在源于组织作为集体与个体作为独立存在之间的根本差异。组织的存在是为了实现特定目标，而个体的存在则是为了自我实现。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，我们看到的是人性化管理与制度化管理之间的张力。FAQ的措辞反映了管理者对员工处境的疏离感。

5. 属和种差：这是一种典型的组织管理异化现象，属为组织与个人的关系，种差在于公共部门特有的制度约束与价值冲突。

表象之下，我们看到了现代组织中普遍存在的沟通鸿沟与价值错位。这提醒我们，真正的管理应该建立在理解与共情的基础之上。

主题：联邦政府裁员计划的具体实施 - essence

输入内容：
[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这个"分岔路"通知的本质是什么？

1. 演化分析：从历史角度看，政府机构规模调整是周期性现象，源于对效率与成本的持续权衡。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于政府职能扩张与精简效率之间的张力，以及员工个人利益与组织整体利益的冲突。

3. 存在理由：这种通知存在的根本原因在于政府需要应对财政压力，同时维持公共服务质量。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，这是一个组织重构的过渡机制，旨在通过自愿离职来优化人力结构。

5. 属和种差：属是组织变革措施，种差是通过提前通知和自愿离职来实现的渐进式人员优化。

表象之下，这是一次组织自我更新的尝试，反映了现代管理中效率与人性化的平衡。

主题：节目制作团队介绍 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P113] [SPEAKER_02]: This episode was produced by Angel Correras with engineering by Robert Rodriguez and Neil Tevold.
[P114] [SPEAKER_02]: It was fact-checked by Sierra Juarez.
[P115] [SPEAKER_02]: Kicking Cannon is our show's editor, and The Indicator is a production of NPR.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段制作人员名单背后的意义。表面上看，这只是一段例行公事的制作团队介绍，但仔细一想，它其实暴露了现代媒体生产的一个残酷现实：我们消费的内容，早已不是某个天才的灵光一现，而是一个庞大工业体系的产物。

Angel Correras负责制作，Robert Rodriguez和Neil Tevold负责工程，Sierra Juarez负责事实核查，Kicking Cannon担任编辑 - 这就像一条流水线，每个环节都有专人负责。我们以为在听一个"节目"，实际上是在消费一个精心设计的工业产品。

更讽刺的是，这种分工明确的制作模式，恰恰反映了现代社会的异化。每个人都成了庞大机器上的一个齿轮，失去了整体视野。我们听到的"声音"，早已不是某个人的真实表达，而是经过层层加工、审核、包装的"产品"。

这不禁让人思考：在这样的生产模式下，真实的声音还存在吗？当创意被分解成无数个标准化的生产环节，我们还能期待听到真正有灵魂的内容吗？或许，这就是现代媒体的困境：在追求专业化的过程中，我们失去了最宝贵的东西 - 真实的人性表达。

输入内容：
[P116] [SPEAKER_09]: Technologist Pau Garcia is using AI to create photos of people's most precious memories.
[P117] [SPEAKER_07]: How her mother was dressed, the haircut that she remembered regenerated tens of images.
[P118] [SPEAKER_07]: And then she saw two images that was like, that was it.
[P119] [SPEAKER_09]: Ideas about the future of memory.
[P120] [SPEAKER_08]: That's on the TED Radio Hour podcast from NPR.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个“用AI重现珍贵记忆”的技术。

现状分析：
在数字时代，我们越来越依赖技术来保存和重现记忆。Pau Garcia的技术通过AI生成照片，试图捕捉人们最珍贵的回忆。这种技术看似美好，但背后隐藏着更深层的问题。

个体剖析：
当一个人看到AI生成的母亲照片时，他们真的在重温记忆吗？还是在创造一个新的、被技术加工过的“记忆”？我们的大脑会如何区分真实记忆和AI生成的图像？这种技术是否会让我们逐渐失去对真实记忆的信任？

群体透视：
从社会角度来看，这种技术可能会改变我们对记忆的认知。如果每个人都可以“完美”地重现记忆，我们是否会失去对不完美但真实的记忆的珍视？这种技术是否会加剧我们对过去的过度美化，导致我们无法正视现实？

思考整合：
这项技术表面上是在帮助我们保存记忆，但实际上可能在重塑我们对记忆的理解。它让我们思考：记忆的本质是什么？是真实的经历，还是可以被技术重构的影像？在追求“完美记忆”的过程中，我们是否正在失去记忆的真实性和珍贵性？

金句：

主题：法律专家对裁员计划的质疑 - essence

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这一现象的本质。从演化分析来看，政府与雇员之间的关系经历了从简单雇佣到复杂法律关系的转变。这一提议反映了现代政府管理中的一种新尝试，但其根源仍在于权力与责任的分配问题。

通过矛盾分析法，我们可以看到这一提议中存在的主要矛盾：总统的行政权力与国会的财政权力之间的张力。总统有权指导政府机构，但国会掌握着财政大权，这种权力分立导致了实施上的不确定性。

从存在主义的角度看，这一提议的存在理由在于试图解决政府运营中的效率问题，但其前提是建立在模糊的法律基础之上。它试图在现有法律框架内寻找新的解决方案，但可能忽视了法律的基本原则。

现象学还原让我们看到，这一提议的本质是一种行政决策，其核心是试图通过经济激励来影响雇员的行为选择。然而，这种决策背后隐藏着更深层的法律和伦理问题。

属和种差定义：这一提议属于政府行政决策的范畴，其种差在于它采用了非传统的、以电子邮件为媒介的辞职方式，并涉及到了行政休假和薪酬支付等复杂法律问题。

表象之下，这一提议反映了现代政府管理中的创新尝试，但其本质仍是一个关于权力、法律和伦理的复杂问题。它是否真的如表面所见那般简单？这值得我们深入思考。

[P109] [SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.

主题：裁员计划的法律程序进展 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P111] [SPEAKER_02]: The federal judge who paused the buyout program is scheduled to hear arguments next week.
[P112] [SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, a separate but similar resignation offer has gone out to employees at the CIA.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个情况。表面上看，这似乎是两个独立的事件：一个联邦法官暂停了买断计划，而中情局则向员工发出了类似的辞职提议。但如果我们剥开表象，会发现一个更令人不安的现实。

首先，这种大规模的买断和辞职计划，本质上是一种“软裁员”策略。企业或机构不想承担直接裁员带来的舆论压力和法律责任，于是用看似“自愿”的方式让员工离开。但真的是自愿吗？在当今经济环境下，有多少员工能真正自由选择？

其次，法官的介入揭示了更深层的问题。为什么需要司法系统来干预一个看似常规的人力资源决策？这背后是否涉及更大的利益博弈？也许这个买断计划触动了某些既得利益集团，或者它可能成为更大规模重组的前奏。

更令人深思的是中情局的类似举措。一个以保密和忠诚著称的情报机构，为何也要采取这种“软裁员”方式？这是否意味着情报系统内部正在进行某种“清洗”或重组？在当前的国际局势下，这种人事变动可能带来什么样的长远影响？

最后，我们不得不问：这些看似独立的事件，是否预示着某种更大的趋势？在经济不确定性加剧的今天，企业和机构是否正在寻找新的方式来削减成本、重组结构，同时规避公众和法律的监督？这种趋势对普通员工、对社会公平，乃至对整个国家的稳定，又意味着什么？

这些问题的答案可能并不令人愉快，但它们值得我们深入思考和警惕。在这个快速变化的时代，我们需要的不仅是表面的理解，更是对深层趋势和潜在风险的洞察。

主题：联邦雇员面临的两难抉择 - essence

输入内容：
[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个情境。表象之下，我们看到了一个联邦雇员面临职业不确定性的困境。通过现象学还原，我们可以剥离表面的焦虑和困惑，发现这个情境的本质在于：

1. 演化分析：职业安全感的缺失源于组织管理政策的变化，这是现代职场中普遍存在的现象，反映了雇佣关系中的权力不对称。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于个人职业发展需求与组织管理决策之间的冲突。雇员渴望稳定和发展，而组织则在权衡成本和效率。

3. 存在理由：这种困境的存在源于现代雇佣制度中固有的不确定性，以及组织在资源分配时的理性计算。

4. 本质还原：褪去具体的细节，这个情境揭示了现代职场中个体在组织决策面前的脆弱性，以及职业发展中的风险与机遇的权衡。

5. 属和种差：这是一个关于职业决策的困境（属），其特殊性在于它发生在政府部门的试用期员工身上，涉及组织政策变动对个人职业发展的直接影响（种差）。

这个情境的本质是：在组织变革的背景下，个体如何在不确定性和风险中做出最优的职业决策。这反映了现代职场中个人与组织之间复杂的权力关系，以及个体在追求职业发展时面临的系统性风险。

主题：美国就业市场最新数据 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P4] [SPEAKER_02]: The latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the economy added 143,000 jobs in January.
[P5] [SPEAKER_02]: The unemployment rate nudged down a tiny bit from December to 4%.

分析结果：
让我们撕开这层光鲜的数据外衣，看看里面藏着什么。

表面上，143,000个新增就业岗位和4%的失业率似乎在宣告经济繁荣。但仔细想想，这些数字真的能反映普通人的生活状况吗？我们是否忽略了那些打零工、做兼职的人？他们可能每周只工作几小时，却仍被统计为"就业人口"。

更讽刺的是，这些数据背后隐藏着多少低薪工作？多少人在勉强维持生计？我们看到的4%失业率，是否掩盖了那些放弃寻找工作的人？那些被算法优化掉的岗位，那些被自动化取代的工人，他们的声音在哪里？

这让我想起马克·吐温的话："谎言有三种：谎言、该死的谎言和统计数据。"我们太容易被这些冰冷的数字迷惑，而忘记了背后真实的人性困境。经济增长的代价是什么？是日益加剧的贫富差距，还是被压榨的劳动力？

也许，真正的问题不在于创造了多少就业岗位，而在于这些岗位能否让普通人过上体面的生活。当我们为这些数字欢呼时，是否应该先问问：这些工作能养活一个家庭吗？能提供医疗保障吗？能让人们看到未来的希望吗？

在这个数据至上的时代，我们更需要用批判的眼光看待这些所谓的"好消息"。因为有时候，最危险的谎言，往往披着最漂亮的数字外衣。

   - 其使命是通过创新解决社会问题

3. 解构假设：
   - 隐含假设：创新能有效应对气候变化
   - 需要质疑：创新是否总是带来正面影响？
   - 潜在问题：某些创新可能带来新的环境问题

4. 辩证分析：
   - 正面：创新确实可能推动环保技术发展
   - 反面：创新也可能被用于不可持续的发展模式
   - 综合：需要引导创新向可持续方向发展

5. 刷新表述：
   该基金会通过支持创新来应对气候变化，这一目标值得肯定。但我们需要审慎评估每项创新的环境影响，确保其真正有利于可持续发展。同时，创新应该与政策、教育等多方面措施协同，才能有效应对气候危机。

分析结果：
### 现状分析
在这个信息爆炸的时代，我们每天都被各种新闻和数据包围。"Jobs Friday" 似乎成为了一个固定的仪式，每个月的这一天，人们都会关注就业数据，仿佛这些数字能决定我们的未来。但真的如此吗？我们是否过于依赖这些统计数字，而忽视了背后的个体故事？

### 个体剖析
让我们抛开这些冰冷的数字，看看每个个体。每个失业者背后都有一个家庭，每个新工作背后都有一个梦想。我们是否只是在关注这些数字的起伏，而忘记了每个数字背后的人？我们的社会是否已经变得麻木，只关心经济增长，而忽视了人的价值？

### 群体透视
从群体的角度来看，"Jobs Friday" 更像是一场集体焦虑的释放。我们通过关注这些数据，试图找到一种安全感，仿佛知道就业率就能预测未来。但这种安全感是虚假的，它掩盖了更深层次的社会问题，比如贫富差距、教育不平等和工作环境的恶化。

### 思考整合
"Jobs Friday" 不仅仅是一个经济指标，它反映了我们对未来的焦虑和对现状的不满。我们过于依赖这些数字，而忽视了每个个体背后的故事。我们需要重新思考，如何在一个数据驱动的社会中，保持对人性的关注和尊重。只有这样，我们才能真正理解"Jobs Friday" 的意义，而不仅仅是它的数字。

[P18] [SPEAKER_05]: Hidden fees may be taking a cut.
[P19] [SPEAKER_05]: With WISE, you can convert between up to 40 currencies at the mid-market exchange rate.
[P20] [SPEAKER_05]: Visit WISE.com.
[P21] [SPEAKER_05]: TNCs apply.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个看似便利的跨境支付服务背后隐藏的真相。

现状分析：
WISE打着"无隐藏费用"的旗号，声称提供中间市场汇率，这听起来确实诱人。但仔细想想，中间市场汇率本身就是个模糊概念，谁来确定这个"中间"在哪里？更何况，所谓的"无隐藏费用"往往意味着更高的显性收费。

个体剖析：
当我们被"节省费用"的承诺吸引时，是否想过我们正在用个人金融数据换取所谓的便利？每一次跨境支付，我们的消费习惯、资金流向都被精准记录。这些数据最终会流向哪里？会被如何使用？我们真的了解这些"便利"背后的代价吗？

群体透视：
在全球化的今天，跨境支付平台正在悄然重塑金融格局。它们打着"打破银行垄断"的旗号，却正在建立新的数据垄断。这些平台收集的海量用户数据，正在成为新的权力来源。我们是否正在从一个垄断走向另一个更隐蔽的垄断？

思考整合：
WISE这样的平台，表面上是金融创新的代表，实则是数据资本主义的新形态。它们用"便利"和"透明"的糖衣包裹着数据采集的苦果。在享受跨境支付便利的同时，我们正在不知不觉中成为数据经济的燃料。这不禁让人思考：在这个数字化时代，真正的"明智"选择究竟是什么？

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
### 十个内核概念

1. **联邦劳动力（Federal Workforce）**：指由联邦政府雇佣的各类工作人员，包括外交官、护士、医生、清洁工、动物学家等。
2. **工作安全（Job Security）**：指员工对其工作稳定性和持续性的信心，尤其是在政策变动或机构重组的情况下。
3. **特朗普政府（Trump Administration）**：指唐纳德·特朗普总统及其政府团队，其政策目标包括缩减联邦劳动力规模。
4. **伊隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）**：作为推动缩减联邦劳动力的关键人物，他采取了激进措施，如解散整个机构。
5. **机构解散（Agency Dismantling）**：指通过强制手段关闭或重组联邦政府机构，以减少雇员数量。
6. **自愿离职计划（Voluntary Separation Program）**：政府提供的一种激励措施，允许员工自愿辞职并继续领取薪酬和福利至特定日期。
7. **薪酬与福利（Pay and Benefits）**：指员工在离职后仍能获得的工资和福利待遇，通常作为离职激励的一部分。
8. **政策变动（Policy Changes）**：指政府为实现特定目标（如缩减劳动力）而实施的政策调整。
9. **劳动力规模（Workforce Size）**：指联邦政府雇佣的员工总数，特朗普政府的目标是大幅减少这一数字。
10. **机构重组（Agency Restructuring）**：指通过调整机构结构和职能来优化或缩减联邦劳动力。

### 三条公理

1. **联邦劳动力规模直接影响政府效率和财政支出**：联邦劳动力的数量与政府运作的效率和财政负担密切相关，缩减劳动力被视为提高效率和减少支出的手段。
2. **政策变动是影响工作安全的主要因素**：政府政策的调整，特别是涉及机构解散和自愿离职计划，直接影响到联邦雇员的工作安全。
3. **激进措施可以快速实现政策目标**：通过采取激进措施如机构解散和自愿离职计划，政府可以在较短时间内实现缩减联邦劳动力的目标。

### 概念关系图

主题：裁员计划与Twitter案例的对比 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P59] [SPEAKER_02]: The fork in the road email shared similarities with the memo that Twitter employees received in 2022 after Elon Musk took over.
[P60] [SPEAKER_02]: It even used the title fork in the road.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个“分岔路口”的隐喻。表面上看，这是一封普通的公司邮件，但仔细一想，这不就是现代职场版的“生存还是毁灭”吗？

看看Twitter员工在马斯克接手后的处境：一夜之间，他们站在了人生的十字路口。左边是“继续前行”，右边是“另谋高就”。这哪里是选择，分明是被迫的选择。

更讽刺的是，这封邮件居然用了“分岔路口”这么诗意的标题。仿佛在说：“亲爱的员工们，你们面前有两条路，但不管选哪条，都是我们说了算。”这简直是现代企业版的“温柔的暴力”。

想想看，这些员工可能已经为公司奉献了多年，现在却要面对如此残酷的现实。他们不是在选择未来，而是在被未来选择。这种“分岔路口”，更像是企业给员工设下的陷阱。

再往深了想，这种现象反映了现代职场的本质：员工不过是企业棋盘上的棋子，随时可以被牺牲。所谓的“分岔路口”，不过是企业为了自身利益而编织的美丽谎言。

所以，下次当你看到“分岔路口”这样的字眼时，别被它的诗意迷惑了。它很可能是一场精心策划的职场生存游戏的开始。在这场游戏中，真正的赢家从来都不是员工，而是那些站在高处俯视的决策者。

主题：广告插播：ThruLine播客 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P121] [SPEAKER_08]: On the ThruLine podcast, the myth linking autism and vaccines was decades in the making and was a major moment for vaccine hesitancy in America, tapping into fears involving the pharmaceutical industry and the federal government.
[P122] [SPEAKER_03]: No matter how many studies you do showing that this is not a problem, it's very hard to unring the bell.
[P123] [SPEAKER_08]: Listen to ThruLine from NPR wherever you get your podcasts.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个关于自闭症和疫苗的迷思。这个迷思的传播不仅仅是一个简单的错误信息，它揭示了更深层次的社会问题。

首先，这个迷思之所以能够持续存在，是因为它巧妙地利用了人们对大型制药公司和政府的不信任。这种不信任并非空穴来风，而是基于历史上的一些真实事件，比如制药公司为了利润而隐瞒药物副作用，或者政府在某些公共卫生事件中的不当处理。这种不信任感像是一块肥沃的土壤，让各种阴谋论和错误信息得以生根发芽。

其次，这个迷思的传播也反映了公众对科学研究的误解。科学研究是一个不断迭代的过程，新的发现可能会推翻旧的结论。然而，许多人却期望科学能够给出一个绝对确定的答案。当科学研究的结果与他们的期望不符时，他们往往会选择相信那些看似简单、直接的解释，而不是接受复杂、不确定的科学结论。

再者，这个迷思的持久性也暴露了信息传播的困境。在互联网时代，错误信息可以迅速传播，而纠正错误信息却往往需要更多的时间和资源。即使有大量的研究证明疫苗与自闭症无关，这些信息也很难覆盖到所有被错误信息影响的人群。这种现象被称为“回旋镖效应”，即纠正错误信息的努力反而可能强化了人们对错误信息的信念。

最后，这个迷思的存在也反映了社会对自闭症的态度。自闭症是一种复杂的神经发育障碍，其成因尚未完全明确。然而，许多人却倾向于寻找一个简单的“罪魁祸首”，比如疫苗。这种倾向不仅忽视了自闭症的复杂性，也加剧了对自闭症患者及其家庭的污名化。

总之，这个关于自闭症和疫苗的迷思不仅仅是一个科学问题，它涉及到社会信任、科学传播、信息生态以及社会对疾病的态度等多个层面。要真正解决这个问题，我们需要从多个角度入手，包括提高公众的科学素养、改善信息传播机制、以及促进社会对自闭症的理解和接纳。

[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

分析结果：

[P120] [SPEAKER_08]: That's on the TED Radio Hour podcast from NPR.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这个案例：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "珍贵记忆"的数字化重构是否等同于真实记忆？
   - AI生成的图像在多大程度上能准确还原历史场景？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 记忆重构技术的发展历程
   - 人类记忆的主观性与可塑性研究

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设1：AI能准确还原记忆
   - 假设2：图像重构能增强记忆真实性
   - 假设3：这种技术对心理健康有益

4. **辩证分析**
   - 正面：可能帮助人们重温美好回忆
   - 负面：可能扭曲真实记忆，造成心理困扰
   - 伦理：隐私保护、知情同意等问题

5. **刷新表述**
   - 记忆重构技术是一把双刃剑，需要谨慎使用
   - 应建立严格的伦理准则和技术标准
   - 使用者需保持清醒认知，区分真实与重构

结论：虽然AI记忆重构技术展现了创新潜力，但其应用必须建立在充分理解人类记忆本质和尊重个人隐私的基础上。我们需要在技术进步与伦理保护之间寻求平衡。

主题：Twitter裁员计划的法律后果 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P86] [SPEAKER_02]: There's also the cautionary tale of Twitter, the last organization to get Elon Musk's fork in the road memo.
[P87] [SPEAKER_02]: The company, now known as X, is reportedly facing lawsuits from thousands of former employees who say that, among other things, they didn't get the severance package they were promised.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个案例。表面上看，这只是又一个关于大公司裁员纠纷的新闻。但如果我们仔细剖析，会发现这背后折射出更深层次的社会问题。

首先，从个体层面来看，这些被裁员工面临的不仅是经济上的困境，更是对未来的不确定性和信任的崩塌。他们曾经相信公司的承诺，却发现自己只是资本游戏中的一枚棋子。这不禁让人思考：在当今社会，普通员工的权益究竟有多少保障？

从公司层面来看，Twitter（现为X）的案例暴露了科技巨头在追求效率和利润最大化时的冷酷无情。Elon Musk的决策或许符合商业逻辑，但这种"先斩后奏"的做法是否过于急功近利？这种管理方式是否真的有利于公司的长远发展？

更宏观地看，这种现象反映了资本主义体系下的深层矛盾。资本追逐利润的本性与员工的生存权益之间存在着根本性的冲突。在科技行业，这种矛盾尤为突出，因为创新和变革的速度往往超过了劳动法规的更新速度。

这让我们不得不思考：在科技快速发展的时代，如何平衡创新与公平？如何确保技术进步不会以牺牲普通劳动者的利益为代价？这些问题不仅关乎Twitter的员工，更关乎我们每个人的未来。

正如马克·吐温所说："历史不会重演，但总会押韵。"Twitter的案例或许只是科技行业发展的一个缩影，但它提醒我们：在追求效率和创新的同时，我们不应忽视人性的温度和社会公平的底线。否则，我们可能会在不知不觉中，成为自己创造的技术怪兽的牺牲品。

[P103] [SPEAKER_01]: I love my job.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely devoted to being a public servant in the National Park Service, and I'm going to keep telling the stories and doing the work that I believe in until I can't do it anymore.
[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.
[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个场景。表面上，我们看到的是一个对工作充满热情的公务员，但背后隐藏着更深层的社会问题。

首先，这种"永远不会考虑辞职"的忠诚度，是否真的值得赞扬？还是说，这其实暴露了公务员系统的一个致命弱点 - 员工被体制化，失去了市场竞争力？当一个人说"我会一直做到做不动为止"，这究竟是职业理想的体现，还是对个人发展机会的放弃？

其次，关于人手不足导致无法完成基本工作的担忧，这揭示了公共服务体系的一个结构性缺陷。我们是否过于依赖个人的奉献精神，而忽视了系统本身的可持续性？当公共服务的基础运转都依赖于个别员工的坚持，这是否意味着整个系统已经岌岌可危？

更深一层，这种"公共服务即奉献"的叙事，是否在某种程度上被滥用了？我们是否在用"使命感"来掩盖低工资、缺乏职业发展机会等现实问题？当一个人说"我爱我的工作"时，我们是否应该问：这份爱是否建立在对现实问题的视而不见之上？

最后，这种状况对整个社会意味着什么？如果公共服务体系崩溃，不仅会影响国家公园的运营，更会动摇整个社会的信任基础。我们是否正在目睹一个关键社会支柱的缓慢坍塌？

思考这些问题，我们不得不承认：一个建立在个人奉献基础上的公共服务体系，本质上是不稳定的。真正的解决方案，或许不在于歌颂个别人的坚持，而在于从根本上改革这个系统，使其更具吸引力和可持续性。否则，我们终将面临一个没有足够人手来维持基本公共服务的社会 - 那将是一个怎样的世界？

[P112] [SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, a separate but similar resignation offer has gone out to employees at the CIA.

分析结果：
休谟举起怀疑之锥，对这两条信息进行深入剖析：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "buyout program"具体指什么？是自愿离职计划还是其他形式的补偿方案？
   - "resignation offer"与"buyout program"有何异同？是同一计划的不同表述，还是完全不同的方案？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 联邦法官暂停收购计划的背景是什么？是基于法律依据还是其他考量？
   - CIA的辞职提议与联邦法官审理的案件之间是否存在关联？

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设这两件事之间存在某种联系，但需要证据支持。
   - 假设"buyout program"和"resignation offer"都是自愿的，但实际情况可能并非如此。

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从法律角度看，联邦法官的暂停令可能基于程序问题或实质性问题。
   - 从组织管理角度看，CIA的辞职提议可能出于预算考虑或战略调整。

5. **刷新表述**
   - 这两条信息反映了政府机构在人事管理上的不同做法，但缺乏足够的背景信息来建立明确的联系。
   - 需要更多细节来理解这些举措背后的动机和潜在影响。

休谟的结论：在缺乏充分背景信息的情况下，我们应谨慎对待这两条信息之间的关系，避免过早下结论。

主题：裁员计划可能带来的负面影响 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P107] [SPEAKER_04]: Critics worry that a hatchet versus scalpel approach to the government workforce will have consequences.
[P108] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says in his experience, the vast majority of federal employees are dedicated to their mission.
[P109] [SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.
[P110] [SPEAKER_06]: But possible byproduct of the Trump administration's designs to thin out the federal workforce is that people may begin to understand firsthand what happens when you gut the federal government.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考这个问题。现状是，政府机构正在经历一场“斧头vs手术刀”的裁员风暴。表面上，这似乎是在精简机构、提高效率，但背后隐藏着更深层的矛盾。

从个体层面来看，Ricardo提到大多数联邦雇员都是尽职尽责的。这些人是真正在推动政府运转的齿轮，他们的工作往往不被看见，但却是维系社会正常运转的关键。裁员不仅意味着失去工作，更意味着失去这些默默无闻但至关重要的服务。

从群体视角来看，特朗普政府削减联邦雇员的举措，实际上是在测试一个危险的假设：政府到底能精简到什么程度？这种“瘦身”可能带来的后果是，公众将直接体验到政府服务缺失的影响——从社会保障到环境保护，从公共安全到基础设施维护，每一个领域都可能因此受损。

更深层的问题是，这种裁员是否真的能带来效率提升？还是说，它只是在削弱政府应对复杂社会问题的能力？当政府被“掏空”，谁来填补这些空白？私人企业？非营利组织？还是说，这些空白将永远存在，成为社会运转的漏洞？

最终，这种“斧头vs手术刀”的裁员方式，可能不仅仅是在削减政府规模，更是在削弱政府作为社会服务提供者的核心职能。当人们开始“亲身体验”政府服务缺失的后果时，也许才会真正意识到，一个健全的政府机构，对于社会运转是多么不可或缺。

正如马克·吐温所说：“历史不会重复自己，但会押韵。”我们是否正在重复历史上那些因过度削减政府职能而导致的失败实验？这个问题值得我们深思。

主题：美国就业市场最新数据 - doubt

输入内容：
[P4] [SPEAKER_02]: The latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the economy added 143,000 jobs in January.
[P5] [SPEAKER_02]: The unemployment rate nudged down a tiny bit from December to 4%.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
- **就业增长**：指的是在一定时期内，新增的就业岗位数量。
- **失业率**：指的是劳动力中没有工作但正在积极寻找工作的人所占的比例。

### 概念溯源
美国劳工统计局（Bureau of Labor Statistics, BLS）是负责收集、分析和发布美国劳动力市场数据的联邦机构。其数据通常被视为经济健康状况的重要指标。

### 解构假设
1. **就业增长的数据来源**：BLS的数据是否全面反映了所有就业形式，包括兼职、临时工和自由职业者？
2. **失业率的计算方法**：失业率是否考虑了那些已经放弃寻找工作的人，或者那些从事非全职工作的人？

### 辩证分析
- **正面观点**：就业增长和失业率下降通常被视为经济向好的信号，表明企业正在扩大生产和服务，消费者信心增强。
- **反面观点**：这些数据可能掩盖了某些问题，例如就业质量（如工资水平、工作条件）的下降，或者某些行业或地区的就业状况不佳。

### 刷新表述
尽管数据显示就业增长和失业率下降，但我们仍需深入分析这些数据的背后含义。例如，新增的就业岗位主要集中在哪些行业？这些岗位的薪资水平和福利待遇如何？此外，失业率的下降是否意味着更多人找到了满意的工作，还是仅仅因为部分人退出了劳动力市场？通过这些问题，我们可以更全面地理解当前的经济状况。

[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: See site for details.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个广告背后的逻辑：

1. **现状分析**：
现代人生活在高压之下，睡眠质量普遍堪忧。商家抓住了这个痛点，用"airy"、"cloud-like"、"breathable"这些词营造出一种虚假的舒适感，仿佛买了他们的产品就能解决所有睡眠问题。

2. **个体剖析**：
我们为什么会被这种广告吸引？是因为我们真的需要这些产品，还是因为我们内心深处渴望一种简单快捷的解决方案？我们是否在逃避真正影响睡眠的因素，比如工作压力、生活习惯、心理状态？

3. **群体透视**：
这种营销手法反映了消费主义文化的一个普遍现象：将复杂的人类需求简化为商品交易。我们被训练成用消费来解决问题，而不是直面问题的根源。这种思维模式正在侵蚀我们的独立思考能力。

4. **思考整合**：
这个广告不仅仅是在卖床上用品，它是在贩卖一种虚幻的解决方案。它利用了我们对优质睡眠的渴望，却忽视了影响睡眠的真正因素。我们应该警惕这种将复杂问题简单化的营销策略，重新思考什么是真正改善生活质量的方式。

"改变睡眠，从改变思维开始，而不是从购买新产品开始。"

[P13] [SPEAKER_02]: Just yesterday, a federal judge paused the offer until at least Monday of next week.
[P14] [SPEAKER_02]: Today on the show, an employment lawyer walks us through the government's deal, which has plunged the federal workforce into confusion and uncertainty.
[P15] [SPEAKER_02]: And we talked to some of those government employees about how they've been weighing this critical decision to stay or go.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个情况。表面上看，这只是一个关于政府员工去留的简单选择，但背后隐藏着更深层次的社会问题。

首先，我们得问问自己：为什么政府会提出这样一个“deal”？真的是为了优化人力资源，还是另有隐情？想想看，当一个政府开始主动鼓励员工离职时，这往往意味着更深层次的财政危机或政治动荡。我们是否正目睹着一个庞大官僚体系开始崩溃的早期迹象？

其次，看看这些员工的处境。他们面临的选择不仅仅是“留”或“走”，而是在不确定的未来中赌一把。留下来，可能意味着在即将到来的裁员潮中首当其冲；离开，则可能失去稳定的收入和福利。这种困境折射出一个更广泛的社会问题：在快速变化的经济环境中，所谓的“铁饭碗”是否还能提供真正的安全感？

再者，法律介入的时机也值得玩味。联邦法官的暂停令是否真的在保护员工权益，还是仅仅在拖延不可避免的结局？这让我们不得不思考：在一个日益复杂的法律体系中，普通公民的利益是否真的得到了有效保护？

最后，让我们从更宏观的角度来看。政府员工的去留问题，实际上是整个社会对公共部门角色认知的缩影。我们是否正在见证一个时代的终结，即“大政府”模式的逐渐瓦解？如果是这样，这对我们每个人意味着什么？

思考这些问题，我们不禁要问：在这个充满不确定性的时代，究竟什么才是真正的“稳定”？也许，答案并不在于我们选择留下还是离开，而在于我们如何重新定义“安全”和“成功”的概念。

主题：联邦政府裁员计划的具体实施 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

主题：联邦雇员面临的两难抉择 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

主题：广告插播：WISE跨境支付服务 - doubt

输入内容：
[P16] [SPEAKER_05]: This message comes from WISE, the app for doing things in other currencies.
[P17] [SPEAKER_05]: Sending or spending money abroad?
[P18] [SPEAKER_05]: Hidden fees may be taking a cut.
[P19] [SPEAKER_05]: With WISE, you can convert between up to 40 currencies at the mid-market exchange rate.
[P20] [SPEAKER_05]: Visit WISE.com.
[P21] [SPEAKER_05]: TNCs apply.

分析结果：
让我们用质疑之锥来解构这段信息：

1. 澄清定义：
- "Hidden fees"具体指什么费用？是否包括汇率差、手续费、服务费等？
- "Mid-market exchange rate"如何定义？是否完全等同于银行间汇率？

2. 概念溯源：
- 跨境支付的历史演变如何？传统银行与新兴支付平台的费用结构有何不同？
- "WISE"平台的运营模式是什么？其盈利来源为何？

3. 解构假设：
- 假设"hidden fees"都是不合理的，这一前提是否成立？
- 假设"mid-market exchange rate"是最优选择，这一判断是否全面？
- 假设所有用户都需要频繁进行货币兑换，这一需求是否普遍？

4. 辩证分析：
- 传统银行与WISE各自的优势与局限是什么？
- 对于不同用户群体（如个人、企业），哪种方案更合适？
- 除了费用，还应考虑哪些因素（如安全性、便利性等）？

5. 刷新表述：
- 选择跨境支付平台时，应综合考虑费用、汇率、安全性、便利性等多方面因素。
- 用户应根据自身需求（如使用频率、金额大小等）选择最适合的方案。
- 在比较不同平台时，应关注总成本，而不仅仅是显性或隐性费用。

最终结论：
WISE可能在某些方面具有优势，但用户应基于全面分析做出选择，而非仅凭广告宣传。建议深入了解各平台的费用结构、汇率机制、安全保障等，并根据自身需求做出理性决策。

主题：裁员计划与Twitter案例的对比 - doubt

输入内容：
[P59] [SPEAKER_02]: The fork in the road email shared similarities with the memo that Twitter employees received in 2022 after Elon Musk took over.
[P60] [SPEAKER_02]: It even used the title fork in the road.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确“fork in the road”这一短语的具体含义。它通常用来描述一个需要做出重要决策的时刻，比喻为在道路分叉处选择方向。

### 概念溯源
接下来，我们追溯“fork in the road”这一表达在Twitter员工备忘录中的使用背景。2022年，Elon Musk接管Twitter后，向员工发送了一份备忘录，标题即为“Fork in the Road”。这份备忘录可能涉及公司未来的战略方向或重大变革。

### 解构假设
假设这两封邮件在内容和目的上存在相似性，我们需要质疑这一假设的合理性。是否仅仅因为使用了相同的标题，就意味着它们在实质内容上也相似？还是说这只是巧合？

### 辩证分析
从多元视角来看，使用相同的标题可能意味着两封邮件都涉及重大决策或变革，但具体内容和背景可能大相径庭。我们需要进一步分析两封邮件的具体内容，以确定它们之间的相似性和差异性。

### 刷新表述
通过系统性怀疑，我们可以得出结论：虽然两封邮件使用了相同的标题“Fork in the Road”，但这并不足以证明它们在内容和目的上完全相似。要确定它们的相似性，需要进一步详细分析两封邮件的具体内容和背景。

最终，我们建议在缺乏具体内容的情况下，不要轻易假设两封邮件在实质内容上存在相似性。

主题：法律专家对裁员计划的质疑 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
### 十个内核概念

1. **联邦雇员 (Federal Employees)**  
   定义：在联邦政府机构中工作的个人，受联邦就业法律和法规的约束。

2. **辞职提议 (Resignation Offer)**  
   定义：政府向联邦雇员提出的通过发送特定邮件主题（如“resign”）来接受辞职的提议。

3. **行政休假 (Administrative Leave)**  
   定义：雇员在未实际工作的情况下仍获得薪酬的休假状态，通常用于调查或特殊安排。

4. **国会拨款 (Congressional Appropriations)**  
   定义：国会为联邦政府机构提供资金的立法行为，决定机构的运营预算。

5. **人事管理办公室 (Office of Personnel Management, OPM)**  
   定义：负责联邦雇员管理和政策的联邦机构，制定和实施相关法规。

6. **法律授权 (Legal Authority)**  
   定义：政府或机构在特定行动中是否具备法律依据和权限。

7. **后付薪酬 (Back Pay)**  
   定义：在拨款中断后，雇员因辞职或休假而应得的未支付薪酬。

8. **联邦就业法 (Federal Employment Law)**  
   定义：规范联邦雇员权利、义务和待遇的法律体系。

9. **法律解释 (Legal Interpretation)**  
   定义：对法律条款或法规的理解和应用，可能因解释不同而产生争议。

10. **工会 (Unions)**  
    定义：代表雇员利益的组织，在就业条件和政策上为雇员发声。

### 三条公理

1. **国会拨款是联邦机构运营的基础**  
   解释：联邦机构的资金来源于国会拨款，拨款中断将直接影响机构的运作和雇员的薪酬。

2. **行政休假的期限受法律限制**  
   解释：现有法律规定行政休假通常不超过10天，除非有特定理由支持延长。

3. **法律授权是政府行动的前提**  
   解释：政府或机构的任何行动必须基于明确的法律授权，否则可能被视为非法。

### 概念关系图

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个“联邦政府瘦身计划”背后的逻辑。表面上看，这是在提高效率、减少开支，但仔细想想，这难道不是一场精心策划的权力游戏吗？

首先，特朗普政府打着“精简机构”的旗号，实际上是在清除异己，巩固自己的权力基础。那些被裁撤的部门，往往是与特朗普政策相左的环保、科研等机构。这哪里是在优化政府结构，分明是在清除异见！

再看看那个“自愿离职计划”，表面上给了员工选择权，实际上是把裁员的责任转嫁给员工自己。这招真是高明啊！政府既达到了裁员目的，又不用承担裁员带来的社会舆论压力。而那些“自愿”离职的员工，真的都是自愿的吗？恐怕更多的是在高压政策下的无奈选择。

更讽刺的是，这些被裁掉的职位，往往是最基层、最辛苦的工作岗位。那些真正需要政府服务的普通民众，反而成了这场“瘦身运动”的最大受害者。政府效率是提高了，但服务质量呢？谁来保障？

说到底，这场所谓的“瘦身计划”，不过是一场权力与利益的重新分配。那些被裁掉的职位，最终可能被外包给与政府关系密切的私人企业。这哪里是在精简政府，分明是在为某些利益集团创造商机！

我们不得不问：这样的“瘦身”，真的符合公众利益吗？还是说，这只是一场披着“改革”外衣的权力游戏？当政府越来越“瘦”，民众的利益会不会也跟着“瘦”下去？这些问题，值得我们深思。

[P36] [SPEAKER_05]: That's why people actually love using it.
[P37] [SPEAKER_05]: Monday.com, the first work platform you'll love to use.

分析结果：
让我们来深入思考一下这个所谓的“工作管理平台革命”。

现状分析：我们生活在一个被效率绑架的时代。企业不断引入各种管理工具，美其名曰提高效率，实则制造了更多的官僚主义。IT部门成了新的“守门人”，员工被各种繁琐的流程折磨得精疲力尽。

个体剖析：我们真的需要这些平台吗？还是说，我们只是在用科技来掩盖管理的无能？人们之所以讨厌这些平台，不是因为它们不够“酷”，而是因为它们暴露了现代职场最丑陋的一面——对控制的痴迷。

群体透视：Monday.com的营销策略很聪明，它抓住了人们对现有系统的厌恶。但问题是，它真的能改变什么吗？还是只是用更漂亮的界面包装了同样的控制欲？我们是否在用“用户友好”来美化对员工的监控？

核心洞察：真正的问题不在于平台本身，而在于我们如何定义“工作”。与其寻找“你会爱上的工作平台”，不如思考：为什么工作变得如此令人厌恶？也许，我们需要的是重新思考工作的意义，而不是用更“可爱”的工具来粉饰太平。

记住：当你听到“你会爱上它”的时候，先问问自己：我到底在爱什么？是真正的自由和创造力，还是只是被包装得更漂亮的枷锁？

分析结果：
让我们用质疑之锥来剖析这个关于自闭症与疫苗关系的迷思：

1. **澄清定义**
   - 首先需要明确"自闭症"和"疫苗"这两个核心概念的科学定义
   - 区分"相关性"与"因果关系"的本质区别

2. **概念溯源**
   - 追溯这一迷思的起源：1998年Andrew Wakefield的争议性研究
   - 考察该研究被揭发存在严重方法学缺陷和利益冲突的过程

3. **解构假设**
   - 质疑"疫苗导致自闭症"这一论断的隐含假设
   - 检验支持这一假设的证据是否充分、可靠

4. **辩证分析**
   - 考虑科学共识：大量严谨研究未发现疫苗与自闭症存在关联
   - 探讨为何这一迷思在公众中持续存在的社会心理因素
   - 分析制药行业与政府监管之间的复杂关系

5. **刷新表述**
   - 基于现有科学证据，可以确定疫苗与自闭症之间不存在因果关系
   - 这一迷思的持续传播反映了科学传播与公众认知之间的鸿沟
   - 解决疫苗犹豫需要加强科学素养教育，建立公众对科学研究的信任

通过系统性怀疑，我们达到了更清晰的认知：疫苗安全性已得到充分验证，而消除这一迷思需要持续的科学传播与公众教育。

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段陈述：

1. **澄清定义**：
   - "fork in the road memo"具体指什么？需要明确其含义和背景。
   - "severance package"的具体条款是什么？需要了解其详细内容。

4. **辩证分析**：
   - 考虑Twitter在收购前的财务状况和员工政策。
   - 探索Elon Musk进行改革的其他可能动机和考量。
   - 寻找员工、公司和社会之间的利益平衡点。

5. **刷新表述**：

主题：节目开场与主持人介绍 - doubt

输入内容：
[P1] [SPEAKER_04]: This is The Indicator from Planet Money.
[P2] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm Darian Woods.
[P3] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm Waylon Wong, and it is Jobs Friday.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确“Jobs Friday”这一概念的具体含义。在经济学和新闻领域，“Jobs Friday”通常指的是美国劳工统计局发布月度就业报告的星期五。这份报告包含了失业率、非农就业人数等关键经济指标。

### 概念溯源
“Jobs Friday”这一术语的起源可以追溯到美国劳工统计局定期发布就业报告的传统。自1940年代以来，美国就开始系统地收集和发布就业数据，以反映劳动力市场的健康状况。随着时间的推移，这些数据发布日逐渐被媒体和公众称为“Jobs Friday”。

### 解构假设
在讨论“Jobs Friday”时，有几个潜在的假设需要被质疑：
1. **数据的准确性**：就业报告的数据是否完全准确？是否存在统计误差或样本偏差？
2. **报告的全面性**：就业报告是否涵盖了所有重要的劳动力市场指标？例如，它是否包括了兼职工作、临时工作等非传统就业形式？
3. **经济影响**：就业报告的数据是否能够全面反映经济的整体健康状况？是否存在其他未被报告的经济指标？

### 辩证分析
从不同的角度来看，“Jobs Friday”具有多重意义：
1. **投资者视角**：对于投资者来说，就业报告是评估经济状况和预测市场走势的重要依据。
2. **政策制定者视角**：政策制定者依赖这些数据来制定和调整经济政策，以促进就业和经济增长。
3. **公众视角**：对于普通公众，就业报告提供了关于劳动力市场状况的直接信息，影响他们的就业决策和消费行为。

### 刷新表述
通过系统性怀疑，我们可以得出以下结论：
“Jobs Friday”不仅是一个发布就业数据的例行日子，更是一个反映经济健康状况、影响市场情绪和政策决策的重要时刻。然而，我们也需要意识到就业报告的局限性，结合其他经济指标和背景信息，才能更全面地理解劳动力市场的真实状况。

因此，尽管“Jobs Friday”提供了宝贵的经济数据，但在解读和应用这些数据时，我们应保持审慎和批判性思维，以避免片面和误导性的结论。

- "exclusions apply"具体指什么？是否存在隐藏条款？

5. 建设性建议：
消费者在购买前应：
- 查阅独立测评报告
- 对比同类产品性价比
- 仔细阅读购买条款
- 考虑自身实际需求

记住，广告宣传往往带有主观性和选择性，保持理性判断至关重要。

主题：裁员计划可能带来的负面影响 - doubt

输入内容：
[P107] [SPEAKER_04]: Critics worry that a hatchet versus scalpel approach to the government workforce will have consequences.
[P108] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says in his experience, the vast majority of federal employees are dedicated to their mission.
[P109] [SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.
[P110] [SPEAKER_06]: But possible byproduct of the Trump administration's designs to thin out the federal workforce is that people may begin to understand firsthand what happens when you gut the federal government.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段对话：

1. **澄清定义**
- "hatchet vs scalpel"的比喻需要明确：是指大规模裁员与精准裁员的区别吗？
- "thin out the federal workforce"具体指什么程度的人员削减？

2. **概念溯源**
- 特朗普政府的公务员政策历史背景是什么？
- 联邦政府精简的历史案例有哪些？结果如何？

3. **解构假设**
- 假设1：大规模裁员必然导致政府功能受损。这个假设有证据支持吗？
- 假设2：公众会因裁员而理解政府的重要性。这个因果关系成立吗？

4. **辩证分析**
- 支持方：精简政府可能提高效率，减少官僚主义
- 反对方：过度裁员可能导致关键职能缺失，影响公共服务
- 综合：需要平衡效率与职能，进行科学评估

5. **刷新表述**
通过分析，我们可以得出：政府人员调整需要基于详实的数据和评估，既要避免过度膨胀导致的效率低下，也要防止过度精简影响基本职能。关键在于建立科学的评估机制，实现精准优化，而非简单的大规模裁员。

主题：联邦雇员对公共服务的忠诚 - doubt

输入内容：
[P102] [SPEAKER_04]: The other employee we talked to, the museum curator at the National Park Service, said she never considered quitting.
[P103] [SPEAKER_01]: I love my job.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely devoted to being a public servant in the National Park Service, and I'm going to keep telling the stories and doing the work that I believe in until I can't do it anymore.
[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.
[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.

分析结果：
让我们对这段对话进行系统性分析：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "public servant"的具体含义是什么？它是否等同于"federal employee"？
   - "devoted"在此语境下是否意味着无条件忠诚？这种忠诚是否有其边界？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 国家公园管理局的历史使命是什么？其员工角色如何随时间演变？
   - "public servant"这一概念在美国政府体系中的起源和发展如何？

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设所有国家公园管理局员工都像SPEAKER_01那样热爱工作，这一假设是否成立？
   - 假设机构人员流失会直接影响基本运营，这一因果关系的证据是否充分？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从机构管理角度：如何平衡员工个人热情与组织运营效率？
   - 从公共服务角度：如何确保关键职能不受人员流动影响？
   - 从个人价值角度：在公共服务中，个人信念与组织需求如何协调？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 公共服务机构的韧性不仅依赖于个体员工的奉献，更需要建立可持续的制度和流程。
   - 真正的公共服务精神应体现在既能保持个人热情，又能确保组织职能的稳定性。
   - 机构应建立人才储备和流程优化机制，以应对人员流动带来的挑战，确保公共服务质量不受影响。

通过这种系统性分析，我们不仅理解了对话中的表面信息，更深入探讨了公共服务机构运营的本质问题。

主题：联邦雇员对裁员计划的反应 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P48] [SPEAKER_02]: One of those employees works at the National Park Service as a museum curator.
[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考这段对话背后的社会现象。表面上，这是一群公务员在抱怨工作环境，但深挖下去，我们看到的是一幅更令人不安的图景。

首先，那位不愿透露姓名的博物馆馆长。为什么在21世纪，一个文化工作者还需要担心因言论而失去工作？这不仅仅是个人胆怯，而是整个体制对异见者的压制。当知识分子的声音被扼杀，我们的文化遗产谁来守护？

再看那些高层管理者的态度。"希望我们离开"——这句话背后隐藏着对整个公共服务体系的蔑视。他们似乎忘记了，正是这些基层公务员维持着国家机器的运转。这种傲慢与脱节，不正是官僚主义的典型症状吗？

最讽刺的是那份FAQ。鼓励公务员去私营部门找工作？这是在暗示什么？公共部门低人一等？还是说政府工作本身就是浪费时间？这种论调暴露了一个危险的倾向：将公共服务的价值完全等同于经济效益。

那位有家庭要养的公务员的质问更是直击要害。"你以为我们是在玩吗？"这句话道出了多少基层工作者的心酸。当管理层与一线员工的生活完全脱节，这样的组织还能有效运转吗？

最后，提到FAQ可能由AI编写，这不禁让人思考：在技术快速发展的今天，我们是否正在用冰冷的算法取代人性化的管理？当决策者完全脱离现实，我们的社会将走向何方？

这段对话揭示的不仅是某个政府部门的问题，而是整个现代社会的困境：官僚体制的僵化、管理层与基层的脱节、公共价值的贬低、技术对人性的侵蚀。如果不正视这些问题，我们的社会将面临更大的危机。

主题：联邦雇员辞职计划的法律争议 - doubt

输入内容：
[P12] [SPEAKER_02]: But is this offer even legal?
[P13] [SPEAKER_02]: Just yesterday, a federal judge paused the offer until at least Monday of next week.
[P14] [SPEAKER_02]: Today on the show, an employment lawyer walks us through the government's deal, which has plunged the federal workforce into confusion and uncertainty.
[P15] [SPEAKER_02]: And we talked to some of those government employees about how they've been weighing this critical decision to stay or go.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确“offer”的具体内容。这里的“offer”指的是政府向联邦雇员提出的某种协议或条件，但具体细节尚不清楚。此外，“legal”一词需要进一步界定，是指是否符合联邦法律，还是指是否符合特定的行政法规。

### 概念溯源
这一提议的背景是什么？它是在什么情况下提出的？是否有相关的历史案例可以参考？例如，过去是否有类似的政府提议被法院暂停或最终被判定为合法或非法？

### 解构假设
1. **假设1**：这一提议的合法性存在争议。我们需要了解具体是哪些法律条款或行政法规引发了争议。
2. **假设2**：联邦法官的暂停令是基于法律依据的。我们需要探究法官的具体判决理由，以及这一判决是否具有普遍性。
3. **假设3**：这一提议对联邦雇员产生了重大影响。我们需要了解提议的具体内容，以及它如何影响雇员的决策。

### 辩证分析
1. **支持提议的观点**：可能认为这一提议有助于提高政府效率或节省成本。
2. **反对提议的观点**：可能认为这一提议侵犯了雇员的权益，或违反了相关法律。
3. **中立观点**：可能认为需要更多信息来评估提议的合法性和影响。

### 刷新表述
基于以上分析，我们可以得出以下结论：
1. 这一提议的合法性确实存在争议，具体取决于其是否符合相关法律和行政法规。
2. 联邦法官的暂停令表明，提议的合法性尚未得到最终确认，需要进一步的法律审查。
3. 这一提议对联邦雇员产生了重大影响，导致他们在决策时面临困惑和不确定性。

最终，我们需要更多具体信息来全面评估这一提议的合法性和影响，包括提议的具体内容、相关法律条款以及法官的判决理由。

主题：联邦政府裁员计划的具体实施 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
**现状分析**  
一封名为“Fork in the Road”的邮件，像一颗石子投入了平静的湖面，激起了200万联邦雇员的涟漪。这封邮件不仅是裁员预警，更像是一场精心设计的“劝退”游戏。它用温和的措辞包裹着冰冷的现实：你可以选择辞职，保留薪水直到九月，但你的职位可能随时被抹去。这种“温柔一刀”的背后，是政府机构“瘦身”的宏大叙事，是效率至上的冰冷逻辑。

**个体剖析**  
对于每个收到邮件的员工来说，这封邮件不是简单的通知，而是一道选择题：是主动离开，还是被动等待？表面上看，这是一个“体面”的选择，但实则是一场心理博弈。它利用了人们对不确定性的恐惧，用“主动辞职”的假象掩盖了“被迫失业”的本质。更讽刺的是，邮件中提到的“保留薪水和福利”不过是安抚人心的糖衣，真正的意图是让员工在等待中逐渐失去安全感，最终自愿退出。

**群体透视**  
从更宏观的角度看，这场“瘦身”运动并非孤立事件，而是整个社会对效率崇拜的缩影。政府机构被贴上“臃肿低效”的标签，裁员成了“提高绩效”的灵丹妙药。但问题在于，效率真的能通过削减人手来实现吗？还是说，这只是一场转移矛盾的把戏？当200万雇员被推向“岔路口”，社会的稳定性和公平性是否也被推向了悬崖边缘？

**思考整合**  
这封邮件不仅仅是一封裁员通知，它揭示了现代社会中效率与人性之间的深刻矛盾。政府机构试图通过“瘦身”来提升效率，但这种做法是否真的能解决问题，还是仅仅将问题转移到了个体身上？当效率成为唯一的目标，人性是否会被无情地牺牲？这场“Fork in the Road”的选择，不仅是员工个人的困境，更是整个社会的反思：我们追求的，究竟是效率，还是人性的尊严？

主题：联邦雇员面临的两难抉择 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考这个联邦雇员面临的困境。表面上，这是一个关于职业选择的个人决策，但背后折射出的是整个系统性的问题。

首先，这种“要么接受，要么走人”的胁迫性提议本身就暴露了体制的腐败。一个本应保护公民权益的政府部门，却在用恐吓和威胁的方式对待自己的员工。这哪里是法治社会该有的样子？更讽刺的是，这种行为发生在司法部，一个本应维护正义的机构。

其次，这种“试用期”制度本身就是对劳动者的剥削。八个月的工作经验，在体制内可能价值连城，但在市场上却可能一文不值。这种制度设计，本质上是为了让雇主能够随时以最低成本解雇员工，而不必承担任何责任。

更深层次来看，这种现象反映了整个社会对劳动者的不尊重。我们生活在一个将人视为可随时替换的零件的时代。企业、政府，都在追求利益最大化，而将个人的尊严和权益抛诸脑后。

这位法务助理的困境，不过是千千万万劳动者的缩影。我们都在这个系统中挣扎，要么接受不公，要么失去一切。这种选择本身就是一种暴力，是对人性的践踏。

所以，当我们谈论这个案例时，我们真正应该思考的是：在这个时代，劳动者的尊严究竟价值几何？我们是否已经默认了这种剥削和压迫的存在？如果连司法部都可以如此对待自己的员工，那么普通民众又能期待什么样的正义？

这不仅仅是一个关于职业选择的故事，这是一个关于我们整个社会价值取向的警钟。

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - doubt

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段陈述：

1. 定义澄清
- "联邦劳动力"具体指哪些职位类别？
- "大幅缩减"的确切含义是什么？

2. 概念溯源
- 特朗普政府缩减联邦劳动力的政策始于何时？
- 这一政策的历史背景和理论依据是什么？

3. 假设解构
- 联邦劳动力规模与政府效率是否存在必然联系？
- 缩减规模是否必然导致政府职能的优化？

4. 辩证分析
- 这一政策可能带来的正面影响：
  * 降低政府运营成本
  * 提高行政效率
- 潜在风险：
  * 关键公共服务可能受到影响
  * 专业人才流失

5. 刷新表述
联邦劳动力规模的调整是一个复杂的政策议题，需要在效率优化和公共服务质量之间寻求平衡。单纯关注数量变化可能忽视了更深层次的政府职能优化问题。更值得探讨的是如何通过结构性改革提升政府效能，而不仅仅是削减人员规模。同时，这一政策的长远影响还需要更多实证研究来评估。

[P28] [SPEAKER_05]: Work management platforms.
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: Red tape, endless adoption time, IT bottlenecks.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: And after all that, nobody really uses them.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But what if you didn't hate your work platforms?
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: What if you actually loved it?
[P33] [SPEAKER_05]: Monday.com work management platform is different.
[P34] [SPEAKER_05]: You can make any changes you want and adapt it to your needs in an instant.
[P35] [SPEAKER_05]: No admin middleman.
[P36] [SPEAKER_05]: That's why people actually love using it.
[P37] [SPEAKER_05]: Monday.com, the first work platform you'll love to use.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确“工作管理平台”和“monday.com”的具体含义。工作管理平台通常指用于规划、执行和监控项目进度的软件工具，而monday.com则是一个具体的品牌，声称其平台与众不同。

### 概念溯源
工作管理平台的概念可以追溯到项目管理软件的发展历史，从早期的甘特图到现代的敏捷管理工具。monday.com作为后起之秀，试图通过用户友好的界面和高度可定制性来区别于传统平台。

### 解构假设
SPEAKER_05的陈述中隐含了几个假设：
1. 传统工作管理平台存在“繁文缛节、漫长的采用时间、IT瓶颈”等问题。
2. 用户通常不喜欢使用这些平台。
3. monday.com通过即时适应需求和无需管理员中介，解决了这些问题。

### 辩证分析
从对立面来看，传统平台可能确实存在一些不便，但也有其稳定性和成熟度。monday.com的即时适应性和无需管理员中介可能带来灵活性，但也可能增加用户的学习曲线和责任负担。

### 刷新表述
综合来看，monday.com确实在用户友好性和定制性方面做出了创新，但这并不意味着它适用于所有场景。用户在选择工作管理平台时，应根据自身需求和团队特点，权衡各种因素，而不仅仅是被“爱用”的承诺所吸引。最终，真正的工作平台应该是能够有效提升团队协作和项目效率的工具，而不仅仅是用户情感上的偏好。

[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考这个看似简单的“辞职邮件”提议背后隐藏的复杂性和潜在问题。

首先，这种通过邮件主题行“辞职”来接受政府提议的方式，本身就暴露了官僚体系的荒谬。它像是一个精心设计的陷阱，用最简化的形式掩盖了最复杂的法律和道德困境。这不禁让人质疑：政府是否在利用员工的困惑和不确定性，来达到某种不可告人的目的？

其次，资金的来源问题更是揭示了政府内部的深层次矛盾。总统有权指挥联邦机构，但国会才是真正掌控钱包的人。这种权力与责任的割裂，不仅导致了当前的混乱，更是暴露了美国政治体系中根深蒂固的缺陷。当政府机构只能依靠短期的资金法案维持运转时，员工的命运就像是一场赌博，随时可能因为政治斗争而陷入困境。

再者，关于行政休假期限的争议，更是让人看到了法律与现实之间的巨大鸿沟。现有的法律将休假期限限制在10天以内，但政府却试图通过“解释”来绕过这一限制。这种对法律的随意解读，不仅损害了法律的严肃性，更是对员工权益的严重侵犯。如果政府可以随意解释法律，那么法律的权威何在？员工的权益又如何得到保障？

最后，联邦员工和工会的质疑，更是揭示了这种提议的不可信性。当连专业的就业律师都无法确定这种提议的合法性时，普通员工又该如何相信政府的承诺？这种信任的缺失，不仅影响了当前的提议，更是对政府公信力的严重打击。

综上所述，这个“辞职邮件”提议不仅仅是一个简单的政策调整，它暴露了政府内部的深层次问题，揭示了法律与现实之间的巨大鸿沟，更是对员工权益和政府公信力的严重挑战。我们需要深入思考，这种提议背后的动机和影响，才能真正理解其复杂性和潜在风险。

[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

分析结果：
让我们来解构这段对话中隐含的假设和潜在问题：

1. **关于匿名性**：
   - 假设：员工需要匿名以保护工作安全
   - 质疑：这种保护的必要性是否暗示了工作环境的不安全性？
   - 溯源：在公共部门，员工表达意见是否普遍存在风险？

2. **关于管理层态度**：
   - 假设：高层希望员工离开
   - 质疑：这种感知是否基于具体行为？是否存在其他解释？
   - 溯源：组织文化是否长期存在这种上下级张力？

3. **关于FAQ的内容**：
   - 假设：鼓励员工辞职或休假是合理的建议
   - 质疑：这种建议是否考虑了员工的实际需求和经济压力？
   - 溯源：公共部门与私营部门的生产力比较是否有实证依据？

   - 质疑：这种沟通方式是否反映了组织与员工之间的认知差距？
   - 溯源：类似的沟通问题是否在其他组织中也普遍存在？

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们可以得出一个更深刻的洞见：这段对话反映的不仅是具体的政策问题，更是组织文化、沟通机制和权力结构等深层次矛盾的体现。解决这些问题需要从根本性的组织变革入手，而不仅仅是调整表面政策。

- "更高绩效"如何定义和衡量？是否有明确的指标？

2. **假设质疑**
- 政府机构真的"臃肿低效"吗？这个判断的依据是什么？
- 裁员是否必然带来效率提升？是否有反例存在？

3. **潜在影响**
- 大规模裁员对政府服务质量和连续性会产生什么影响？
- 这种政策是否会导致关键岗位人才流失？

4. **替代方案**
- 是否存在比裁员更优的效率提升方案？
- 如何平衡精简机构和保持政府职能之间的关系？

5. **更深层问题**
- 这种政策背后的真正动机是什么？
- 它是否反映了某种特定的政治理念或经济理论？

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们或许能更深入地理解这个政策的本质和可能带来的影响。

主题：联邦雇员面临的两难抉择 - doubt

输入内容：
[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这个情境：

1. **定义澄清**：
- "Probationary employee"的具体定义是什么？不同部门是否有统一标准？
- "List"的性质是什么？是裁员名单还是常规评估？

2. **概念溯源**：
- 这种"offer"和"list"的做法在联邦政府中的历史如何？
- 人事管理办公室(OPM)发布此类指令的背景是什么？

3. **假设解构**：
- 假设1：接受offer是唯一出路。但是否存在其他选择？
- 假设2：留在岗位必然导致被裁。是否有数据支持这种推断？
- 假设3：工作经验只能在当前岗位获得。是否考虑过其他获取经验的途径？

4. **辩证分析**：
- 从员工角度：短期利益vs长期发展
- 从管理者角度：组织优化vs人才保留
- 从制度角度：灵活性vs稳定性

5. **刷新表述**：
这种困境反映了现代职场中普遍存在的"不确定性管理"挑战。关键不在于被动接受或拒绝，而在于主动构建多元化的职业发展路径。建议：
1. 系统评估个人核心竞争力
2. 拓展职业网络，寻找潜在机会
3. 制定灵活的职业规划，而非非此即彼的选择

最终，这种困境不应被视为单纯的危机，而应被理解为职业发展的转折点，促使个人进行更深层次的自我认知和职业定位。

主题：法律专家对裁员计划的质疑 - doubt

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
1. **联邦雇员**：指在联邦政府机构中工作的员工。
2. **行政休假**：指员工在未实际工作的情况下，仍保留职位并领取工资的状态。
3. **国会拨款**：指国会为联邦政府机构提供的资金支持。

### 概念溯源
这一提议的背景是联邦政府机构的资金问题。当前，大多数联邦机构的资金仅支持到三月中旬，届时当前的拨款法案将到期。这导致了一些机构在资金不确定的情况下，提出了让员工通过发送电子邮件辞职的提议。

### 解构假设
这一提议的假设包括：
1. **总统有权指导联邦机构**：虽然总统有权指导联邦机构，但实际支付工资的是国会。
2. **行政休假的合法性**：根据现有法律，行政休假通常不超过10天，除非有特定原因。

### 辩证分析
从不同角度来看：
1. **总统与国会的权力分配**：总统可以指导机构，但资金来源于国会，这可能导致实际操作中的矛盾。
2. **行政休假的延长**：虽然人事管理办公室认为法规可以解释为允许延长行政休假，但许多就业律师和工会对此表示质疑。

### 刷新表述
基于以上分析，我们可以得出以下结论：
1. **资金问题**：由于国会拨款的不确定性，联邦雇员在辞职后是否能获得工资存在风险。
2. **行政休假的合法性**：延长行政休假的法律依据不明确，可能导致法律纠纷。

因此，这一提议在资金和法律层面都存在不确定性，联邦雇员在接受提议时需要谨慎考虑。

[P901] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll jump in and then let Jason finish.
[P902] [SPEAKER_03]: But we write a quarterly newsletter and monthly commentaries that goes to our clients, but anyone can receive it.
[P903] [SPEAKER_03]: So if you go to our website, donvillekent.com, you can sign up.
[P904] [SPEAKER_03]: And we just, we write about similar conversations like we had today.
[P905] [SPEAKER_03]: But Jason, I'll hand it over to you.

[P906] [SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are skeptical.
[P907] [SPEAKER_01]: We just let people read our newsletter.
[P908] [SPEAKER_01]: Just realize that when we talk about companies, we already own them.
[P909] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're not going to tell you about the company that we're just about to invest in tomorrow.
[P910] [SPEAKER_01]: But once we're in, someone says, what's in there for us?
[P911] [SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to share our ideas and engage.
[P912] [SPEAKER_01]: Part of the discovery process is we've found this really great company.
[P913] [SPEAKER_01]: There's still a lot of upside.
[P914] [SPEAKER_01]: We already got our piece, but there's still lots of upside for you guys, so have a look.
[P915] [SPEAKER_01]: And Jesse does most of the writing of the newsletter now, and I think, you know, it's very well received.
[P916] [SPEAKER_01]: People like it.
[P917] [SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of ideas and...
[P918] [SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a, it's kind of a fresh look at the market and a lot of companies that are not, people have already got a lot of exposure to Microsoft and Apple.
[P919] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of companies that go, wow, these are kind of interesting companies, you know, but I haven't heard of them before.
[P920] [SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[P921] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you really want to learn about us, the newsletter is the best place to go.

分析结果：
从信息传播的角度来看，这个对话揭示了一个巧妙的营销策略：通过分享已有的投资决策来建立信任，而不是推销未来的投资机会。这种做法有几个聪明之处：

1. **可信度提升**：他们只讨论已经投资的公司，避免了"推销嫌疑"，让读者觉得信息更真实可信。

2. **价值共享**：强调即使他们已经投资，这些公司仍有上升空间，创造了"共赢"的感觉。

3. **内容差异化**：专注于介绍不太知名但有趣的公司，填补了市场信息的空白，提供了独特价值。

4. **持续互动**：通过定期发布通讯，建立了与读者的长期联系，而不是一次性推销。

这种策略巧妙地将营销包装成价值分享，既展示了专业性，又不会让人产生被推销的反感，可谓一举多得。

主题：市场情绪与资金流动 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
从历史视角来看，资金从货币市场基金回流股市的过程确实像是一个“缓慢的渗漏”。但如果我们跳出这个框架，从投资者心理的角度重新思考，会发现一个有趣的观察角度：

投资者对风险的承受能力其实就像一个“温度计”，而市场环境则是“气温”。在危机时期，这个温度计会急剧下降，资金迅速流向安全的避风港。但随着市场回暖，这个温度计会缓慢回升，资金也会逐步回流到风险资产。

这个过程中有两个关键“温度节点”：
1. 当货币市场基金的收益率低于投资者的预期时，他们会开始考虑其他投资选择
2. 当市场环境稳定到让投资者觉得“最坏的时候已经过去”时，他们的风险偏好会显著提升

所以与其关注资金回流的速度，不如关注这两个“温度节点”何时被触发。这就像等待春天到来，当气温达到某个临界点时，万物自然会复苏。在当前环境下，我们可能已经接近第二个“温度节点”，这意味着资金回流的速度可能会加快。

输入内容：
[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
从投资的角度来看AI，其实可以把它比作是"现代版的蒸汽机"。就像工业革命时期，蒸汽机彻底改变了制造业的生产方式，AI正在重塑现代商业的运作模式。

有趣的是，最成功的AI应用往往不是那些标榜自己是"AI公司"的企业，而是那些把AI当作工具来提升效率的传统企业。这就像当年最赚钱的并不是制造蒸汽机的工厂，而是那些率先采用蒸汽机来提高生产效率的纺织厂。

从投资回报来看，科技领域确实更容易产生"十倍股"。但关键不在于追逐"纯AI概念"，而在于寻找那些能够巧妙运用AI来提升核心竞争力的企业。就像淘金热时期，最赚钱的不是淘金者，而是卖铲子的人。

所以，看待AI对商业的影响，应该关注它如何成为企业的基础设施，就像电力一样无处不在却又不可或缺。那些能够将AI深度融入业务流程，创造出独特竞争优势的企业，才是未来的赢家。

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

主题：AI技术对投资的影响 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

输入内容：
[P901] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll jump in and then let Jason finish.
[P902] [SPEAKER_03]: But we write a quarterly newsletter and monthly commentaries that goes to our clients, but anyone can receive it.
[P903] [SPEAKER_03]: So if you go to our website, donvillekent.com, you can sign up.
[P904] [SPEAKER_03]: And we just, we write about similar conversations like we had today.
[P905] [SPEAKER_03]: But Jason, I'll hand it over to you.

[P906] [SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are skeptical.
[P907] [SPEAKER_01]: We just let people read our newsletter.
[P908] [SPEAKER_01]: Just realize that when we talk about companies, we already own them.
[P909] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're not going to tell you about the company that we're just about to invest in tomorrow.
[P910] [SPEAKER_01]: But once we're in, someone says, what's in there for us?
[P911] [SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to share our ideas and engage.
[P912] [SPEAKER_01]: Part of the discovery process is we've found this really great company.
[P913] [SPEAKER_01]: There's still a lot of upside.
[P914] [SPEAKER_01]: We already got our piece, but there's still lots of upside for you guys, so have a look.
[P915] [SPEAKER_01]: And Jesse does most of the writing of the newsletter now, and I think, you know, it's very well received.
[P916] [SPEAKER_01]: People like it.
[P917] [SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of ideas and...
[P918] [SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a, it's kind of a fresh look at the market and a lot of companies that are not, people have already got a lot of exposure to Microsoft and Apple.
[P919] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of companies that go, wow, these are kind of interesting companies, you know, but I haven't heard of them before.
[P920] [SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[P921] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you really want to learn about us, the newsletter is the best place to go.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这段对话的本质。通过方法论怀疑，我们可以分析其内在结构和目的：

1. 演化分析：从商业传播的角度，这种对话形式源于传统的客户沟通方式，但已演变为更开放、更具互动性的信息共享模式。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于信息透明度与商业机密之间的平衡。发言者试图在保护自身投资策略的同时，向公众分享有价值的信息。

3. 存在理由：这种沟通方式的存在是为了建立信任、展示专业能力，并吸引潜在客户或投资者。

4. 本质还原：褪去具体内容，这本质上是一种市场营销策略，通过知识分享来建立品牌影响力和客户关系。

5. 属和种差：这是一种商业信息传播（属），其特点是通过定期发布投资见解来建立专业形象和吸引关注（种差）。

因此，这段对话的本质是一种以知识共享为媒介的商业营销策略，其核心目的是在保护自身利益的同时，通过有价值的内容输出建立品牌影响力和客户信任。

主题：市场环境与宏观经济 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

主题：公司成长与估值 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**“科技股的长期投资价值”**

**1. 尺度转换：**  
从宏观市场趋势来看，科技股在过去几十年中表现出了显著的增长潜力。无论是美国还是加拿大，科技行业都占据了多倍股（multi-baggers）的绝大部分。这意味着，科技行业不仅仅是短期的热门，而是长期投资的重要领域。

**2. 跨界思维：**  
将科技行业与其他行业进行类比，科技行业类似于“创新引擎”，不断推动经济和社会进步。这种持续的创新动力使得科技公司能够保持高增长，从而为投资者带来丰厚回报。

**3. 极限思考：**  
在极端情况下，假设科技行业停止创新，整个经济将陷入停滞。然而，现实是科技行业不断创新，推动其他行业的发展。这种不可替代性使得科技股在长期投资中具有独特的价值。

**4. 系统思维：**  
科技行业不仅仅是独立的存在，它与金融、医疗、制造等多个行业紧密相连。科技公司的成功往往带动整个生态系统的繁荣，这种系统性的增长潜力使得科技股成为长期投资的首选。

**5. 逆向思考：**  
如果科技股不再具有高增长潜力，那么整个市场的增长动力将大大减弱。然而，历史数据和当前趋势都表明，科技行业仍然是经济增长的主要驱动力。

**6. 简化思维：**  
科技股的核心价值在于其创新能力。只要科技公司能够持续创新，它们就有能力保持高增长，从而为投资者带来长期回报。

**7. 历史视角：**  
回顾历史，无论是美国的科技巨头还是加拿大的科技新秀，科技行业都诞生了大量的多倍股。这种历史经验为科技股的长期投资提供了有力的支持。

**8. 跳出框架：**  
抛开传统的估值框架，科技股的价值不仅仅体现在当前的盈利水平，更体现在其未来的增长潜力。因此，科技股的估值往往高于其他行业，但这种高估值是合理的。

**结论：**  
科技股由于其持续的创新能力和系统性的增长潜力，在长期投资中具有独特的价值。尽管当前估值可能较高，但从历史数据和未来趋势来看，科技股仍然是长期投资的首选。

主题：投资策略与市场表现 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**“投资中的韧性如同冲浪”**

想象一下，投资就像冲浪。市场波动就像是海浪，有时温和，有时狂暴。成功的投资者，就像经验丰富的冲浪者，知道如何在不同的浪况中保持平衡，甚至利用浪的力量前进。

**1. 识别浪况（市场环境）**  
冲浪者首先要观察海浪的形态和力量，投资者也需要敏锐地感知市场的变化。Jason和Jesse在2008年和2020年的两次市场暴跌中，依然能够找到被低估的增长股，这就像冲浪者在巨浪中依然能找到最佳的起乘点。

**2. 保持平衡（策略稳定性）**  
冲浪者在浪中需要不断调整重心，但不会轻易放弃自己的冲浪板。同样，Donville Kent资产管理公司在2021年至2023年的困难时期，虽然被利率的突然上升打了个措手不及，但他们并没有完全改变策略，而是选择了耐心等待市场重新认可他们的投资标的。

**3. 利用浪的力量（市场波动）**  
冲浪者懂得如何利用浪的力量来加速前进，而不是被浪打倒。Jason和Jesse在市场的低谷期，依然能够保持高水平的投资表现，正是因为他们懂得如何在市场的波动中找到机会，而不是被短期的困难所吓倒。

**4. 长期视角（韧性）**  
冲浪是一项需要长期练习和积累经验的运动，投资也是如此。Jason和Jesse能够在长时间的市场波动中保持成功，正是因为他们具备了一种“韧性”——这种韧性让他们在市场“打拳击”时，依然能够站稳脚跟，最终赢得比赛。

### 总结：  
投资中的韧性，就像冲浪中的平衡感，是一种在波动中保持稳定、在逆境中找到机会的能力。Jason和Jesse的成功，不仅仅是因为他们的投资策略，更是因为他们具备了这种“冲浪者”的韧性。无论市场如何变化，他们都能找到自己的节奏，最终乘风破浪，抵达成功的彼岸。

主题：市场情绪与资金流动 - essence

输入内容：
[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。货币市场基金的本质是什么？它反映了投资者在不确定环境中的避险需求。从演化角度看，这种避险行为在2000年和2008年危机后都曾出现，表明这是人类面对风险时的本能反应。

主要矛盾在于：安全性vs收益性。投资者在危机时追求安全，但当市场稳定后，又渴望更高收益。这种矛盾驱动着资金在货币市场与股票市场之间的流动。

从存在主义视角看，货币市场基金的存在理由在于为投资者提供暂时的避风港。它满足了人类在不确定性中寻求确定性的心理需求。

褪去表象，我们看到货币市场基金的真正本质：它是投资者情绪的温度计，反映了市场信心与风险偏好的变化。当恐惧消退，追求收益的本能就会重新占据主导。

因此，货币市场基金的本质可定义为：一种在特定市场环境下，满足投资者短期避险需求的金融工具，其规模变化反映了市场风险偏好的周期性波动。

让我们从最基本处开始思考AI的本质。从演化角度看，AI起源于人类对智能的模仿与延伸，其核心在于通过算法实现数据处理与模式识别。使用矛盾分析法，AI的主要矛盾在于其强大的计算能力与缺乏真正的意识之间的对立。从存在主义视角，AI存在的理由在于提升效率、解决复杂问题，但其存在前提是人类的需求与技术的进步。通过现象学还原，褪去表象，AI的本质是一种增强人类能力的工具，而非独立的智能体。因此，AI的本质定义是：一种基于算法和数据处理的工具，旨在增强和扩展人类的能力，通过自动化和优化来提升效率和解决复杂问题。

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
就像冬眠的熊，资金在市场动荡时躲入安全的洞穴，等待春天的到来。随着恐惧的消退和信心的恢复，它们会慢慢从冬眠中苏醒，重新回到森林中觅食。这个过程虽缓慢，但如同季节更替般不可避免。

[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what we didn't see coming, right?
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see that the supply constraints coming out of COVID was what's going to whack us because we actually were doing okay up until then.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.
[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

分析结果：
### 观察角度：**从"时间"维度重新审视投资决策**

#### 核心洞察
投资中的每个决策都存在于一个时间轴上，而时间本身就是一个最容易被忽视的变量。当我们把时间作为主要观察维度时，许多看似复杂的问题都会变得异常简单。

#### 具体分析
1. **利率跳涨的应对**  
   - 时间视角：利率变化是一个周期性事件，历史上多次发生
   - 简化方案：建立利率敏感性分析模型，提前模拟不同利率场景下的投资组合表现

2. **供应链冲击的适应**  
   - 时间视角：COVID是一个短期极端事件，但供应链重构是长期趋势
   - 简化方案：将投资组合分为"短期应对"和"长期布局"两个维度

3. **回撤期的韧性管理**  
   - 时间视角：回撤是投资过程中的必然组成部分，而非异常事件
   - 简化方案：建立"时间加权回撤容忍度"指标，将回撤与时间维度绑定

4. **头寸规模的决定**  
   - 时间视角：投资决策是一个动态过程，而非静态时点的选择
   - 简化方案：采用"时间阶梯式建仓"策略，根据时间维度分阶段调整头寸

#### 关键结论
将时间作为核心观察维度，可以将复杂的投资决策简化为一个时间序列管理问题。通过建立时间维度的分析框架，投资者能够更清晰地把握决策的关键节点，从而做出更明智的选择。

[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**投资中的“舒适区”与“价值洼地”**

在投资中，选择持有或放弃某只股票，往往不仅仅是基于财务数据，更多的是基于投资者的“舒适区”和对“价值洼地”的认知。让我们从以下几个角度来解析这个问题：

1. **管理层的熟悉度**  
   - **舒适区效应**：投资者往往更倾向于持有那些他们长期跟踪、与管理层有深入交流的公司。这种熟悉感带来了心理上的安全感，即使其他公司看起来更有潜力，投资者也可能因为不熟悉而选择放弃。
   - **信息不对称**：对管理层的了解程度直接影响投资决策。如果对某家公司的管理层不够熟悉，投资者可能会认为风险较高，即使其估值和增长潜力诱人。

2. **估值与成长性的权衡**  
   - **价值洼地**：Constellation Software的估值（18倍市盈率）明显低于其分拆公司Lumine和Topicus（30倍市盈率）。从估值角度看，Constellation可能被视为“价值洼地”，更具安全边际。
   - **成长性溢价**：虽然Lumine和Topicus是高增长公司，但高估值也意味着市场已经充分定价了其未来增长。投资者可能认为，与其支付溢价，不如选择估值更合理的母公司。

3. **行业集中度与风险分散**  
   - **科技股的集中度**：正如SPEAKER_01提到的，75%的多倍股来自科技行业。这表明科技股具有较高的成长潜力，但也意味着风险集中。投资者可能选择通过持有母公司来间接分散风险，而不是直接持有分拆公司。

4. **历史经验与心理锚定**  
   - **历史回报的锚定效应**：Constellation Software在过去15年为投资者带来了丰厚的回报，这种历史表现可能让投资者对其未来充满信心，即使分拆公司看起来更有潜力。
   - **路径依赖**：长期持有某只股票的成功经验会让投资者形成路径依赖，倾向于继续持有，而不是转向新的机会。

### 结论：**投资决策是理性与感性的结合**  
从独特视角看，SPEAKER_03和SPEAKER_01的决策并非单纯基于财务数据，而是综合了管理层的熟悉度、估值、行业集中度以及历史经验等多重因素。这种决策方式体现了投资中理性分析与感性认知的平衡，也揭示了为什么他们选择持有Constellation Software而非其分拆公司。

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.

[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.

   - 利率上升环境：IR↑ → S&P 500回报↓ (0.8%)
   - 类比：利率对资产价格如重力对苹果

3. **AI Impact (AI)**
   - AI对企业影响：AI = 效率↑ + 收入增长↑ + 利润率↑
   - 具体影响因企业而异

### 知识精髓提炼
- **BP** ≈ 利润率 + 收益增长 + 估值扩张
- **IR** ↔ 资产价格 (IR↓ → 回报↑, IR↑ → 回报↓)

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.

[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.

[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取

主题：投资理念与估值方法 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

分析结果：
### 独特观察角度：**"估值倍数背后的成长性与确定性"**

#### 1. **尺度转换**  
   - **放大尺度**：从单一的估值倍数（如30倍或18倍）跳出来，看公司所处的行业生命周期和竞争格局。高估值倍数（如30倍）通常反映了市场对公司未来高成长的预期，而低估值倍数（如18倍）可能意味着市场对公司的成长性或确定性存在疑虑。
   - **缩小尺度**：深入分析公司具体的财务指标（如收入增长率、现金流利润率）和业务模式，判断其是否支撑得起当前的估值。

#### 2. **跨界思维**  
   - 将“规则40”从科技公司扩展到其他行业，类似于将“摩尔定律”从半导体行业应用到其他技术领域。这种跨界应用的核心逻辑是：**高增长与高现金流的结合是任何行业健康发展的标志**。

#### 3. **极限思考**  
   - **极端情况1**：如果一家公司的收入增长率为0%，但现金流利润率为40%，它是否符合“规则40”？答案是肯定的，但这可能意味着公司处于成熟期，缺乏成长性。
   - **极端情况2**：如果一家公司的收入增长率为40%，但现金流利润率为0%，它是否符合“规则40”？答案也是肯定的，但这可能意味着公司正在大量烧钱，未来现金流存在不确定性。

#### 4. **系统思维**  
   - 将估值倍数置于更大的系统中考虑，包括行业竞争、经济周期、管理团队能力等。例如，Lumine和Topic的30倍估值可能反映了它们在高速增长行业中的领先地位，而Constellation的18倍估值可能反映了市场对其行业增速或竞争格局的担忧。

#### 5. **逆向思考**  
   - 如果一家公司的估值倍数远低于行业平均水平，是否意味着它被低估？不一定，可能是市场对其成长性或确定性存在疑虑。反之，高估值倍数也不一定意味着高估，可能是市场对其未来成长的高度认可。

#### 6. **简化思维**  
   - 估值倍数的核心驱动因素是**成长性**和**确定性**。高成长性（如高收入增长率）和高确定性（如稳定的现金流利润率）共同支撑高估值。

#### 7. **历史视角**  
   - 回顾历史，高估值倍数的公司（如亚马逊、特斯拉）在早期也备受质疑，但其高成长性和确定性最终证明了其估值的合理性。

#### 8. **跳出框架**  
   - 完全抛开估值倍数的数字，关注公司是否具备**可持续的竞争优势**和**长期价值创造能力**。这才是估值的本质。

### 最终结论  
估值倍数（如30倍或18倍）只是表象，关键在于公司是否具备**高成长性**和**高确定性**。通过“规则40”等工具，可以更清晰地判断公司的健康状况。高估值倍数并不一定意味着高估，低估值倍数也不一定意味着低估，关键在于公司是否能够持续创造价值。

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考投资中的韧性这一概念。表象之下，投资韧性究竟意味着什么？

1. 演化分析：从投资的历史演进来看，市场波动是永恒的主题。早期的投资者主要面临商业周期风险，而现代投资者还需应对货币政策、地缘政治等复杂因素。但无论时代如何变迁，应对不确定性的能力始终是投资成功的关键。

2. 矛盾分析：投资韧性的主要矛盾在于：一方面需要坚持既定的投资理念和策略，另一方面又需要根据市场变化做出适当调整。这种坚持与适应的平衡，构成了投资韧性的核心。

3. 存在理由：投资韧性之所以必要，源于市场的本质特征：非理性、不确定性和周期性波动。没有韧性，投资者将难以在市场波动中保持清醒，更无法在长期中实现持续的超额收益。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，投资韧性的本质是：在坚持投资原则的基础上，保持对市场的敬畏和适应能力。它既不是盲目坚持，也不是随波逐流，而是一种基于深刻认知的灵活应对。

5. 属和种差：投资韧性是一种心理特质（属），表现为在面临市场压力和逆境时，能够保持理性判断、坚持投资原则并适时调整策略的能力（种差）。

因此，投资韧性的本质定义是：在长期投资过程中，面对市场波动和压力时，保持理性判断、坚持投资原则并适时调整策略的心理特质和能力。这种韧性不是简单的坚持，而是基于深刻市场认知的灵活应对，是长期投资成功的关键要素。

主题：市场环境与宏观经济 - essence

输入内容：
[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考AI的本质。表象之下，AI究竟是什么？

从演化分析来看，AI源于人类对智能的模拟和延伸。它经历了从规则系统到机器学习，再到深度学习的演进。但不变的内核是：AI是处理信息的工具。

使用矛盾分析法，AI的主要矛盾在于：它既是人类智能的延伸，又可能威胁人类主体性。这种矛盾推动着AI的发展方向。

从存在主义角度，AI存在的理由在于它能解决人类无法独立完成的问题。其存在的前提是：人类需要更高效的信息处理方式。

通过现象学还原，褪去"人工智能"这一表象，AI的本质是：基于数据和算法的自动化决策系统。

因此，AI的属和种差定义是：AI是一种基于数据和算法的自动化决策系统，旨在模拟和延伸人类智能，以提高信息处理效率。

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这些对话背后的本质。

1. 演化分析：从历史角度看，投资理念经历了从单纯价值投资到成长性投资的转变。对话中提到的"40法则"和估值倍数反映了现代投资理念对高增长企业的偏好。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于短期估值与长期增长潜力之间的张力。高估值可能意味着高风险，但也可能预示着高成长性。

3. 存在理由：这种投资思维存在的根本原因在于资本对超额回报的永恒追求，以及科技行业作为主要增长引擎的现实。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，这些对话的核心是在探讨如何在不确定性中寻找确定性，即通过特定的估值指标和行业特征来识别潜在的高回报投资机会。

5. 属和种差：这些对话属于现代投资决策的范畴，其特殊之处在于它融合了定量估值指标与定性管理团队评估，并特别关注科技行业的高成长特性。

本质而言，这些对话展现了一种基于理性分析和经验判断的投资决策方法论，其核心是在复杂的市场环境中寻找具有长期增长潜力的投资标的。

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
就像一艘船在风暴中航行，Donville Kent资产管理公司经历了2008年和2020年的两次经济危机，依然能保持航向，超越S&P 500。他们像是经验丰富的船长，能够提前发现市场的暗礁，找到被低估的增长股。然而，2021年至2023年的利率飙升，就像突如其来的巨浪，让他们一度措手不及。尽管如此，他们并未改变策略，而是像老练的航海家一样，耐心等待风暴过去，坚信市场最终会认可他们的眼光。这种韧性，就像是船体坚固的龙骨，支撑着他们在市场的风浪中持续前行，最终驶向成功的彼岸。

[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。Constellation Software及其分拆公司Lumine和Topicus的本质是什么？

从演化分析来看，这些公司都源于软件行业的发展。软件作为一种数字化的解决方案，其核心价值在于通过技术手段提高效率、优化流程。Constellation Software通过收购垂直市场软件公司，形成了一个独特的商业模式。Lumine和Topicus作为其分拆公司，继承了这一基因，但各自专注于不同的细分领域。

从矛盾分析来看，主要矛盾在于"专注与分散"之间。Constellation Software通过集中管理实现规模效应，而分拆公司则追求更专注的发展路径。这种矛盾体现了企业在发展过程中对资源分配和战略聚焦的权衡。

从存在理由来看，这些公司的存在源于市场对专业化软件解决方案的需求。它们通过提供特定领域的软件产品，满足客户的独特需求，从而创造价值。

通过本质还原，我们可以发现这些公司的核心在于"通过软件技术解决特定问题"。无论是Constellation Software还是其分拆公司，都是这一本质的不同表现形式。

因此，从属和种差的角度定义，这些公司属于"垂直市场软件解决方案提供商"，其种差在于各自专注的细分领域和具体的技术实现方式。

[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。投资组合管理的本质是什么？它是对有限资本的优化配置，以实现长期价值最大化。在这个框架下，头寸规模的决定成为核心问题。

从演化角度看，头寸规模管理源于人类对风险与回报的永恒权衡。其内在矛盾在于：集中投资可能带来高回报，但也伴随着高风险；分散投资降低风险，却可能稀释收益。这一矛盾推动着投资策略的不断演进。

存在主义视角下，头寸规模管理的存在理由在于：投资者必须直面不确定性，在有限认知下做出最优决策。它体现了人类在资本市场中的理性选择。

通过现象学还原，我们可以褪去复杂的估值模型和风险测算，发现头寸规模管理的本质：它是投资者对自身认知确信度的量化表达。高确信度对应大仓位，低确信度对应小仓位，这是最根本的决策逻辑。

因此，头寸规模管理可定义为：投资者基于对投资标的认知确信度，对资本进行优化配置的决策过程（属），其核心在于将主观判断转化为客观的仓位比例（种差）。

[P920] [SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[P921] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you really want to learn about us, the newsletter is the best place to go.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个投资通讯的本质。表面上，他们声称要分享投资见解，帮助投资者发现新的机会。但仔细一想，这背后隐藏着更深层的动机。

首先，他们强调只分享已经投资的公司，这本身就暴露了一个问题：他们是在为自己的投资背书。当他们在通讯中大肆宣扬某家公司时，实际上是在为已经持有的股票造势，吸引更多投资者入场，从而推高股价。这不就是典型的"拉高出货"策略吗？

其次，他们声称要"分享想法，参与讨论"，但仔细想想，这不过是一种营销手段。他们真正的目的是吸引更多投资者关注，扩大自己的影响力，从而在市场上获得更大的话语权。这种所谓的"分享"，本质上是一种自我推销。

再者，他们提到通讯中介绍的公司大多是"人们没听说过的有趣公司"。这听起来很诱人，但仔细一想，这些公司往往缺乏透明度和市场认可度，投资风险极高。他们推荐这些公司，很可能是为了在市场上制造热点，吸引投机资金，从而为自己谋利。

最后，他们声称通讯"很受欢迎，很多人喜欢"，但这并不能证明其内容的真实性和可靠性。在投资领域，受欢迎程度往往与质量无关，甚至可能是泡沫的征兆。

总的来说，这种投资通讯更像是一种精心设计的营销工具，而不是真正为投资者服务的教育平台。它利用投资者的好奇心和贪婪心理，为自己的利益服务。作为投资者，我们需要保持清醒的头脑，不要被表面的光鲜所迷惑，而应该深入思考背后的动机和风险。毕竟，在投资领域，没有免费的午餐，任何看似美好的机会背后，都可能隐藏着巨大的陷阱。

[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。投资中的仓位管理，其本质是什么？

从演化角度看，仓位管理源于人类对风险与收益的永恒权衡。原始人狩猎时，也会考虑投入多少时间和资源去追捕不同的猎物。这种权衡机制在金融投资中演变为仓位管理。

主要矛盾在于：集中投资可能带来高收益，但同时也意味着高风险；分散投资可以降低风险，但也可能稀释收益。这种风险与收益的矛盾，构成了仓位管理的核心问题。

从存在主义视角，仓位管理之所以存在，是因为投资本身的不确定性。如果未来是确定的，就不需要仓位管理。正是这种不确定性，使得仓位管理成为必要。

通过现象学还原，褪去"仓位管理"这一表象，我们看到其本质是投资者对不确定性的应对策略。它反映了投资者对风险的认知、对机会的判断，以及自身的心理承受能力。

因此，仓位管理的本质定义是：投资者在面对不确定性时，根据自身风险承受能力和对机会的判断，动态调整投资组合中各项资产比例的系统化决策过程。这是投资艺术与科学的结合，是理性与直觉的平衡。

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
就像在一片森林中寻找能长成参天大树的幼苗，科技领域的公司往往是最有潜力的种子。它们就像森林中的先锋物种，率先占领生态位，快速生长。虽然其他领域也有机会，但科技公司就像那些能在贫瘠土地上扎根的植物，展现出惊人的适应力和扩张能力。正如加拿大与美国在科技领域的相似性，就像同一片森林中不同区域，却孕育着相似的物种。投资者就像园丁，需要识别出那些最有潜力的幼苗，给予它们时间和空间，等待它们长成参天大树。

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
让我用几个类比来阐述这些宏观主题：

1. 企业盈利增长和估值扩张就像一艘帆船，顺风时（低利率环境）乘风破浪，逆风时（高利率环境）寸步难行。2024年的经济环境就像一阵强劲的顺风，推动企业盈利和估值同步上扬。

2. 利率对资产价格的影响，就像重力对苹果的作用。低利率环境就像月球上的重力，让资产价格轻松跃升；而高利率则像地球重力，将资产价格牢牢拉回地面。

3. AI对企业的影响，就像工业革命对传统手工业的冲击。一些企业就像当年的马车制造商，可能面临被淘汰的风险；而另一些企业则像汽车制造商，将借助AI实现跨越式发展。AI就像一台永不停歇的引擎，推动企业效率提升和收入增长。

4. 不同企业面对AI的态度，就像不同物种面对环境变化的适应能力。有些企业像恐龙，固守传统模式，可能面临灭绝；而另一些企业像哺乳动物，灵活适应，将在AI时代占据主导地位。

这些类比帮助我们更直观地理解复杂的宏观经济和企业发展规律。就像通过望远镜观察星空，恰当的类比能让我们看清那些原本模糊的宏观图景。

输入内容：
[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
投资组合管理就像园艺，需要精心修剪和培育。高信念仓位就像种下一棵大树，需要深厚的土壤和充足的养分。卖出理由如同识别病树，当投资回报率下降、估值离谱、管理层失信或债务过高时，就像树木失去生机，需要果断移除。未来复利企业则像一片茂盛的森林，需要持续的盈利能力、高回报的再投资机会和长期的成长空间。竞争压力和技术颠覆就像森林中的风雨，需要评估其对树木生长的影响。

[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.

分析结果：
就像在一片广袤的森林中，科技公司是那些生长最快的树木。它们不仅枝叶繁茂，而且果实累累。Constellation Software就像是这片森林中的一棵参天大树，经过15年的培育，已经从一棵小苗长成了枝繁叶茂的巨树。而它的分拆公司Lumine和Topicus，则像是从这棵大树上分出的新枝，虽然也生机勃勃，但投资者对它们的管理团队还不够熟悉，就像对一片新开垦的林地还不够了解一样。此外，从估值角度来看，Constellation Software的市盈率只有18倍，而Lumine和Topicus的市盈率却高达30倍，这就像是在森林中，一棵成熟的树木往往比新生的树苗更物有所值。总的来说，科技领域就像是一片沃土，孕育了众多高成长的公司，而Constellation Software无疑是这片沃土上最耀眼的明星之一。

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **成长与价值**：成长型业务（Growth）≈ 价值投资（Value）
2. **估值指标**：收入增长（Revenue Growth） + 盈利增长（Earnings Growth） → 企业估值（Valuation）
3. **40法则**：收入增长率（Revenue Growth） + 现金利润率（Cash Margins） ≥ 40% → 健康业务（Healthy Business）
4. **管理团队**：管理团队熟悉度（Management Familiarity） ↔ 投资决策（Investment Decision）
5. **估值倍数**：市盈率（P/E Ratio） → 高增长公司（High Growth Companies）

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **成长与价值的关系**：
   - 传统价值投资者（Traditional Value Investors） - 高估值（High Multiples） = 逃离（Run for the Hills）
   - 成长型投资者（Growth Investors） ≈ 价值投资者（Value Investors） + 高增长（High Growth）

2. **估值指标的运用**：
   - 收入增长（Revenue Growth） + 盈利增长（Earnings Growth） → 企业估值（Valuation）
   - 估值（Valuation） ÷ 增长（Growth） = 便宜（Cheap）、合理（Reasonably Priced）、高估（Overvalued）

3. **40法则的扩展**：
   - 40法则（Rule of 40） ≈ 软件业务（Software Businesses） → 健康业务（Healthy Business）
   - 40法则（Rule of 40） * 广泛应用（Broad Application） = 跨行业工具（Cross-Industry Tool）

4. **管理团队的影响**：
   - 管理团队熟悉度（Management Familiarity） ↔ 投资决策（Investment Decision）
   - 管理团队（Management Team） + 长期关系（Long-term Relationship） = 投资信心（Investment Confidence）

5. **估值倍数的比较**：
   - 市盈率（P/E Ratio） → 高增长公司（High Growth Companies）
   - 市盈率（P/E Ratio） ≈ 30倍（30x） vs. 18倍（18x） → 估值差异（Valuation Difference）

### 知识精髓提炼
成长型投资（Growth Investing） ≈ 价值投资（Value Investing） + 高增长（High Growth）  
估值（Valuation） = 收入增长（Revenue Growth） + 盈利增长（Earnings Growth）  
40法则（Rule of 40） = 收入增长率（Revenue Growth） + 现金利润率（Cash Margins） ≥ 40%  
管理团队熟悉度（Management Familiarity） ↔ 投资决策（Investment Decision）  
市盈率（P/E Ratio） → 高增长公司（High Growth Companies）

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个关于货币市场基金和资金流动的对话。表面上看，这只是一场关于金融市场的技术性讨论，但背后折射出的却是人性在危机中的本能反应。

首先，我们看到的是人类面对不确定性时的"鸵鸟心态"。当市场动荡时，人们本能地选择"躲进"货币市场基金这个"避风港"。这让我想起马克·吐温说过的一句话："历史不会重演，但总是押韵。"从2000年互联网泡沫到2008年金融危机，再到COVID-19疫情，人类在危机中的反应何其相似。

但更值得玩味的是这种"慢出血"现象。资金从货币市场基金缓慢回流到风险市场的过程，实际上反映了人类心理的微妙变化。我们就像在黑暗中摸索的盲人，小心翼翼地试探着每一步。这种谨慎与其说是理性，不如说是创伤后的应激反应。

讽刺的是，当人们终于鼓起勇气重返市场时，往往已经错过了最佳时机。这让我想起鲁迅笔下的阿Q精神——我们总是用"慢出血"来安慰自己，却不愿直面自己的恐惧和犹豫。

从更宏观的角度看，这种现象暴露了现代金融体系的一个根本矛盾：我们追求稳定，却又渴望高回报；我们厌恶风险，却又不得不承担风险。这种矛盾就像一把双刃剑，既保护了我们，又限制了我们的视野。

最终，这些躺在货币市场基金里的7万亿美元，不仅仅是冰冷的数字，更是人类集体心理的写照。它们提醒我们：在金融市场上，最大的风险往往不是市场本身，而是我们自己的心理。正如欧·亨利所说："生活就是由一系列意外组成的。"也许，真正的智慧不在于预测市场，而在于理解人性。

[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what we didn't see coming, right?
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see that the supply constraints coming out of COVID was what's going to whack us because we actually were doing okay up until then.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.
[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

分析结果：
就像在海上航行，突然遭遇了意料之外的风暴。利率的急剧上升就像突如其来的狂风，而COVID带来的供应限制则如同暗流，让我们措手不及。2022年对我们来说，就像一场突如其来的海难，我们被打得措手不及。

但正如航海者需要坚韧不拔的精神，投资也是如此。市场就像大海，有时会把你当作沙袋一样击打。那些在长期投资中依然屹立不倒的经理人，必然具备某种形式的韧性。面对漫长的下跌期，他们如何保持高水平的业绩表现，就像航海者在风暴中如何保持航向一样关键。

在投资组合管理方面，尤其是头寸规模的控制，就像在船上分配货物。当我们对一个想法非常有信心时，我们会投入大量资本，就像在船上装载重要的货物。但进入一个高确信的头寸并不是一蹴而就的，就像在船上装载货物需要谨慎考虑平衡和风险一样。

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?

[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

主题：AI技术对投资的影响 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
AI，这个被无数人追捧的“未来”，究竟是一场革命还是一场幻觉？让我们剥开这层光鲜的外衣，看看里面到底是什么。

首先，所谓的“提高效率”，不过是资本家的新借口。他们用AI取代人力，美其名曰“优化流程”，实则是为了削减成本，增加利润。那些被AI取代的工人，他们的生计谁来保障？社会的稳定又靠什么维持？

其次，AI真的能带来创新吗？还是只是另一种形式的“复制粘贴”？我们看到的所谓“创新”，不过是把旧有的模式用AI重新包装。真正的创新需要人类的智慧和创造力，而不是冰冷的算法。

再者，AI的普及是否会加剧社会的不平等？那些掌握AI技术的公司和个人，将获得更多的财富和权力，而普通人则可能被边缘化。这种技术垄断，是否会导致新的社会阶层分化？

最后，AI的发展是否真的符合人类的利益？还是只是为了满足少数人的贪婪？我们是否应该反思，技术的进步究竟是为了什么？是为了让人类生活得更好，还是为了满足某些人的私欲？

AI，这个看似光鲜的未来，背后隐藏着无数的陷阱和危机。我们是否应该停下来，好好思考一下，这条路究竟通向何方？

[P901] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll jump in and then let Jason finish.
[P902] [SPEAKER_03]: But we write a quarterly newsletter and monthly commentaries that goes to our clients, but anyone can receive it.
[P903] [SPEAKER_03]: So if you go to our website, donvillekent.com, you can sign up.
[P904] [SPEAKER_03]: And we just, we write about similar conversations like we had today.
[P905] [SPEAKER_03]: But Jason, I'll hand it over to you.

[P906] [SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are skeptical.
[P907] [SPEAKER_01]: We just let people read our newsletter.
[P908] [SPEAKER_01]: Just realize that when we talk about companies, we already own them.
[P909] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're not going to tell you about the company that we're just about to invest in tomorrow.
[P910] [SPEAKER_01]: But once we're in, someone says, what's in there for us?
[P911] [SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to share our ideas and engage.
[P912] [SPEAKER_01]: Part of the discovery process is we've found this really great company.
[P913] [SPEAKER_01]: There's still a lot of upside.
[P914] [SPEAKER_01]: We already got our piece, but there's still lots of upside for you guys, so have a look.
[P915] [SPEAKER_01]: And Jesse does most of the writing of the newsletter now, and I think, you know, it's very well received.
[P916] [SPEAKER_01]: People like it.
[P917] [SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of ideas and...
[P918] [SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a, it's kind of a fresh look at the market and a lot of companies that are not, people have already got a lot of exposure to Microsoft and Apple.
[P919] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of companies that go, wow, these are kind of interesting companies, you know, but I haven't heard of them before.
[P920] [SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[P921] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you really want to learn about us, the newsletter is the best place to go.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确“newsletter”和“commentaries”的具体含义。在这里，它们指的是由Donville Kent公司编写的季度通讯和月度评论，旨在向客户和公众分享他们的投资观点和市场分析。

### 概念溯源
这种形式的通讯和评论在金融行业中并不罕见。许多投资公司通过定期发布报告来与客户和潜在投资者保持联系，分享他们的投资策略和市场见解。这种做法可以追溯到早期的金融通讯和投资报告，如《华尔街日报》和《金融时报》等。

### 解构假设
SPEAKER_01提到，他们在通讯中讨论的公司都是他们已经投资的。这暗示了一个潜在的假设：他们的投资决策是基于深入的研究和分析，因此他们的观点具有较高的可信度。然而，这并不意味着他们的观点没有偏见，因为他们已经持有这些公司的股份，可能会有意或无意地强调正面信息。

### 辩证分析
从正面看，这种通讯可以为投资者提供新的投资思路和市场见解，特别是对于那些不为人熟知的公司。从负面看，由于他们已经在这些公司中持有股份，他们的观点可能存在利益冲突，读者需要谨慎对待。

### 刷新表述
综上所述，Donville Kent的通讯和评论为投资者提供了一个了解他们投资策略和市场观点的窗口。然而，读者在参考这些信息时，应保持审慎态度，结合其他信息来源进行综合判断。这种通讯的价值在于其提供的新颖视角和深入分析，但同时也需要警惕潜在的利益冲突。

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.

主题：投资理念与估值方法 - essence

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。投资估值这一概念的本质是什么？

从演化分析来看，估值方法经历了从简单的市盈率到复杂的现金流折现模型的演变。但不变的内核是对企业未来价值创造能力的评估。

使用矛盾分析法，我们发现估值中存在的主要矛盾是：市场对企业未来增长的预期与当前实际表现之间的差距。这导致了估值方法的多样性。

从存在主义角度思考，估值之所以存在，是因为投资者需要一种工具来比较不同投资机会的相对吸引力。这是其存在的根本理由。

通过现象学还原，褪去各种估值指标的表象，我们发现估值的本质是对企业持续创造价值能力的量化评估。这包括对增长潜力、盈利能力和风险的综合判断。

因此，估值可以定义为：一种基于企业未来价值创造能力的量化评估方法，其核心在于平衡增长预期与实际表现，为投资决策提供相对参照。

这一本质定义揭示了估值作为投资决策工具的根本属性，也解释了为何不同投资者会采用不同的估值方法 - 因为他们对企业未来价值创造能力的判断标准存在差异。

[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

主题：市场情绪与资金流动 - doubt

输入内容：
[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段对话：

1. 定义澄清：
- "Money market funds"具体指什么类型的投资工具？
- "Lag times"如何量化？是从资金进入货币市场基金到流入股市的时间跨度吗？

2. 概念溯源：
- 历史类比是否恰当？2000年和2008年的市场环境与当前有多大可比性？
- 利率变化与资金流动性的关系是否有实证研究支持？

3. 假设解构：
- 假设投资者行为模式会重复历史，这个前提是否成立？
- 假设市场环境与过去类似，这个预设是否经得起推敲？
- 假设投资者风险偏好会随着时间推移而增加，这个判断是否过于简单化？

4. 辩证分析：
- 考虑对立面：是否有证据表明资金可能不会回流股市？
- 多元视角：除了利率，还有哪些因素可能影响资金流向？
- 综合观点：在当前的宏观经济环境下，资金流动可能呈现怎样的新特征？

5. 刷新表述：
基于系统性怀疑，我们可以得出以下新见解：
- 资金流动模式可能因数字金融创新而改变，传统的时间滞后性可能缩短
- 投资者行为可能受到更多非经济因素影响，如ESG投资理念的普及
- 市场结构的变化可能导致资金流向呈现新的特征，不能简单套用历史经验

最终结论：
在分析资金流动时，我们需要考虑更多维度的因素，避免过于简化的历史类比。当前的市场环境与过去存在显著差异，投资者行为模式也可能发生根本性变化。因此，我们需要采用更动态、更全面的分析框架来理解资金流向。

主题：AI技术对投资的影响 - doubt

输入内容：
[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段对话中的几个关键点：

1. **AI效率提升的假设**
   - 需要追问：具体是哪些效率指标得到了提升？
   - 数据支持：是否有具体案例或数据证明AI确实带来了可量化的效率提升？
   - 因果关系：效率提升是否确实归因于AI，而非其他因素？

2. "75%的大赢家来自科技行业"的论断
   - 定义模糊：什么是"大赢家"？如何界定？
   - 样本偏差：研究样本是否具有代表性？
   - 时间跨度：这个结论是否适用于不同时期？
   - 因果关系：科技行业成功是否确实归因于行业特性，而非其他因素？

3. 加拿大与美国市场的类比
   - 差异性：加拿大市场与美国市场在结构、规模、政策等方面是否存在显著差异？
   - 数据支持：是否有具体数据证明加拿大市场的"大赢家"分布确实与美国相似？
   - 时间因素：这种相似性是否在不同时期都成立？

4. AI作为工具的普遍性
   - 适用范围：哪些行业或业务类型更适合使用AI作为工具？
   - 成本效益：AI工具的使用成本与收益是否匹配？
   - 长期影响：过度依赖AI工具是否可能带来其他风险或问题？

通过这些质疑，我们可以更深入地理解AI对商业的影响，并形成更全面的认识。例如，可能需要更具体的数据和案例来支持AI提升效率的论断，同时也要考虑不同市场和行业的特殊性。此外，对于科技行业成功的原因，可能需要更细致的分析，而不是简单地归因于行业特性。

输入内容：
[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话背后的本质。表面上，这是一段关于投资策略和业绩的讨论，但剥开这层表象，我们看到的是一场关于人性的博弈。

首先，看看这些投资经理的自述：他们如何在市场波动中保持冷静，如何坚持自己的策略。这听起来很励志，但仔细想想，这不就是人性中"自证预言"的典型表现吗？他们坚信自己的策略是对的，于是不断寻找证据来证明这一点，哪怕在市场最糟糕的时候。这种固执，到底是智慧还是盲目？

再看看主持人的提问方式。他不断强调"韧性"的重要性，仿佛这是成功的唯一秘诀。但这是不是一种幸存者偏差？我们只看到了那些坚持下来并成功的人，却忽视了更多坚持却失败的人。这种叙事方式，不正是我们社会对成功者的美化吗？

更深一层，整个对话都在强调"长期投资"的价值。但在这个信息爆炸、瞬息万变的时代，长期真的还是一种美德吗？还是说，这只是既得利益者为了维持现状而编织的美丽谎言？

最后，让我们思考一下"成功"的定义。这些投资经理以超越标普500为荣，但这是否意味着他们的成功？在一个贫富差距日益扩大的社会里，这种成功是否加剧了社会的不平等？我们是否应该重新思考，什么才是真正值得追求的成功？

这场对话，表面上是在讨论投资策略，实际上却暴露了现代社会的诸多矛盾：个人与系统的对抗，短期与长期的博弈，成功与道德的冲突。它提醒我们，在这个复杂的世界里，任何简单的答案都可能是陷阱。真正的智慧，或许在于保持怀疑，不断追问，而不是盲目追随所谓的成功典范。

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话背后的本质。

首先，这些投资专家在谈论什么？他们在用一堆专业术语和数字来包装一个简单的概念：如何找到能长期持有的优质股票。但仔细想想，这不就是现代版的"点石成金"吗？他们用"40法则"、"30倍市盈率"这些数字来给自己寻找安全感，仿佛掌握了某种投资秘籍。

但现实是，市场永远充满不确定性。这些所谓的"长期持有"策略，本质上不过是在赌未来。他们用"科技股占75%"这样的统计数据来给自己壮胆，却忽视了科技行业本身就是最容易被颠覆的领域。

更讽刺的是，这些投资专家对"管理团队"的依赖。他们声称因为"长期接触"某个管理团队就感到"舒服"，这难道不是典型的确认偏误吗？在商业世界里，昨天的明星CEO可能就是明天的失败者。

说到底，这些投资讨论暴露了现代金融体系的一个根本矛盾：我们试图用理性和数据来预测一个本质上不可预测的未来。这种努力本身就充满了荒谬性。

或许，真正的投资智慧不在于寻找所谓的"40法则"，而在于承认我们无法真正预测未来。在这个充满不确定性的世界里，保持谦逊和警惕，或许才是最明智的选择。

输入内容：
[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.

[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
### 现状分析
Constellation Software及其分拆公司Lumine和Topicus在投资界备受关注。投资者对这些公司的长期表现和估值有着浓厚的兴趣。特别是，Constellation Software的长期持有者对其分拆公司的态度引发了讨论。

### 个体剖析
为什么投资者选择持有Constellation Software而不持有其分拆公司Lumine和Topicus？表面上看，这可能是因为对原公司的熟悉和对新公司的不确定性。但深层次的原因可能更为复杂。首先，估值是一个关键因素。Constellation Software的市盈率为18，而Lumine和Topicus的市盈率高达30，这意味着后者被市场赋予了更高的增长预期。然而，高估值也带来了更高的风险。投资者可能更倾向于持有估值较低、风险相对较小的原公司。

### 群体透视
从更广泛的角度看，科技行业是产生多倍回报的主要领域。无论是在美国还是加拿大，科技公司占据了多倍回报的75%。这表明，科技行业的高增长潜力吸引了大量投资者。然而，这种集中也带来了风险。科技行业的高波动性和不确定性使得投资者在选择具体公司时需要更加谨慎。Constellation Software的长期成功可能正是因为它能够在科技行业中找到稳定且持续增长的机会，而分拆公司的高估值可能让投资者望而却步。

### 思考整合
投资者选择持有Constellation Software而不持有其分拆公司Lumine和Topicus，背后是多重因素的权衡。估值、对管理团队的熟悉程度以及科技行业的整体风险都在其中扮演了重要角色。最终，投资者需要在追求高回报和控制风险之间找到平衡。Constellation Software的长期成功证明了这种平衡的重要性，而分拆公司的高估值则提醒我们，高回报往往伴随着高风险。

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下投资组合管理和估值的问题。表面上，这些对话充满了理性的分析和框架，但背后隐藏的是一种对确定性的执着追求。我们总想找到那个完美的公式，那个能让我们永远不犯错的系统。但现实是，投资本质上是一种面对不确定性的艺术。

看看这些所谓的卖出标准：资本回报率下降、估值过高、管理层不可信、负债过多。它们听起来很合理，但仔细想想，这些标准本身不就是主观判断吗？什么叫“估值过高”？什么叫“管理层不可信”？这些不都是事后诸葛亮式的解释吗？

更讽刺的是，我们一边追求确定性，一边又在不断打破自己的规则。当遇到真正高信心的投资机会时，我们又会说“这次不一样”，然后大举投入。这不就是人性中的贪婪和恐惧在作祟吗？

所谓的“未来复合增长者”的三个标准：盈利能力、高回报再投资能力、长期增长空间。听起来很美好，但现实中有多少企业能真正满足这些条件？即使满足了，我们又如何确定这些条件能持续？技术变革、竞争压力、政策变化，哪一个不是随时可能颠覆这些所谓的“确定性”？

我们总想用框架和系统来驯服市场，但市场从来就不是一个可以被驯服的野兽。它充满了随机性和不可预测性。我们所谓的投资框架，不过是在这个充满不确定性的世界里，给自己的一点心理安慰罢了。

真正的投资智慧，或许不在于找到那个完美的系统，而在于学会与不确定性共处，在混沌中寻找机会，在变化中保持灵活。毕竟，在这个世界上，唯一确定的就是不确定性本身。

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
让我们用休谟的怀疑之锥来解构这段对话中的关键论点：

1. 关于"40法则"的适用性
   - 需要质疑：这个法则是否适用于所有行业和公司？历史数据是否支持这一结论？
   - 潜在假设：高估值必然意味着长期持有价值，这一假设需要验证

2. 市盈率比较
   - 需要澄清：30倍和18倍市盈率的差异是否单纯由增长性决定？
   - 潜在问题：未考虑行业特性、商业模式差异等关键因素

3. 科技股的主导地位
   - 需要验证：75%的十倍股来自科技行业，这一数据是否具有代表性？
   - 潜在偏差：样本选择是否全面？时间跨度是否足够？

4. 管理团队的影响
   - 需要质疑：对管理团队的熟悉程度是否会影响投资决策的客观性？
   - 潜在风险：过度依赖主观判断可能导致的认知偏差

通过系统性怀疑，我们可以得出：
投资决策需要更全面的分析框架，不能过度依赖单一指标或主观判断。每个投资标的都需要基于其独特的商业本质进行深入分析，避免简单的经验主义。同时，历史数据虽然重要，但不能完全预测未来，需要结合行业趋势和公司基本面进行综合判断。

输入内容：
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what we didn't see coming, right?
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see that the supply constraints coming out of COVID was what's going to whack us because we actually were doing okay up until then.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.
[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.

[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话背后的本质。表面上是在讨论投资策略和风险管理，但更深层次上，这反映了人类在面对不确定性时的脆弱与挣扎。

首先，利率的突然飙升和疫情带来的供应链问题，这些所谓的“黑天鹅”事件，其实不过是人类自以为能掌控一切的傲慢被现实狠狠打脸的证据。我们总是高估了自己的预测能力，低估了世界的复杂性。就像SPEAKER_01说的“我们完全被打趴下了”，这种无奈的语气暴露了人类在面对不可控因素时的无力感。

其次，关于“韧性”的讨论更是讽刺。SPEAKER_05将其视为投资的必备特质，但仔细想想，这不就是在为市场的残酷性找借口吗？我们不得不“坚韧”，因为市场本质上就是一个无情的拳击场，投资者不过是沙袋而已。所谓的“韧性”，不过是挨打后还能站起来的代名词。

最后，关于仓位管理的讨论更是暴露了投资者的矛盾心理。一方面想要集中投资以获取最大收益，另一方面又害怕承担过大的风险。这种患得患失的心态，不正是人类在面对不确定性时的典型表现吗？我们总是在贪婪和恐惧之间摇摆，试图找到那个完美的平衡点，但往往事与愿违。

归根结底，这段对话揭示了一个残酷的真相：在投资领域，甚至在整个生活中，我们都在与不确定性作斗争。我们制定策略，培养韧性，管理风险，但最终，我们仍然无法完全掌控结果。这或许就是人类存在的本质：在不确定的海洋中，努力保持漂浮，同时不断质疑自己是否真的在前进。

所以，下次当你听到有人谈论投资策略时，不妨问问自己：我们真的在掌控局面，还是只是在为无法掌控的事情寻找借口？这种反思，或许比任何投资策略都更有价值。

主题：投资理念与估值方法 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.

[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
让我们用休谟的怀疑之锥来解构这段对话：

1. **定义澄清**
   - "outperform the S&P 500"的具体含义是什么？是年化收益率、风险调整后收益，还是其他指标？
   - "resilience"在投资语境下的准确定义是什么？是心理承受能力，还是策略的适应性？

2. **概念溯源**
   - Donville Kent Asset Management的投资策略具体是什么？文中并未详细说明。
   - 2021-2023年的市场环境具体发生了哪些变化？仅提到利率上升，但缺乏具体数据支撑。

3. **假设解构**
   - "beating the S&P 500"是否意味着投资策略的成功？这忽略了风险因素和策略的可持续性。
   - "resilience"是否是长期投资成功的必要条件？这可能有幸存者偏差的问题。

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从正面看，该基金确实在多个市场周期中表现出色。
   - 从反面看，2021-2023年的表现不佳可能暗示策略存在局限性。
   - 从综合角度看，投资策略需要不断适应市场变化，而非单纯依赖"resilience"。

5. **刷新表述**
   - 投资绩效评估应该采用多维度的指标，而非单一的比较基准。
   - 投资策略的成功不仅需要"resilience"，更需要灵活性和适应性。
   - 长期投资成功的关键在于不断学习和进化，而非固守某种策略。

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们可以更深入地理解投资绩效评估的复杂性，以及投资策略成功背后的真正驱动因素。

[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.

[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段对话中的关键点：

1. **概念澄清**：
   - 需要明确"multi-bagger"的具体定义和衡量标准
   - "valuation"的具体计算方法和假设前提
   - "tech sector"的边界和分类标准

2. **假设解构**：
   - 高估值是否必然意味着高增长潜力？
   - 历史数据是否能够准确预测未来表现？
   - 管理层熟悉度是否等同于投资价值？

3. **辩证分析**：
   - 从对立面思考：低估值公司是否可能被低估？
   - 考虑其他因素：行业周期、竞争格局、技术变革等
   - 探索多元视角：不同市场、不同时期的投资回报特征

4. **刷新认知**：
   - 投资决策应基于全面分析，而非单一因素
   - 历史经验需要结合当前市场环境进行动态调整
   - 估值水平应与公司基本面、成长性相匹配

5. **建设性建议**：
   - 建立系统性的投资分析框架
   - 关注公司长期价值创造能力
   - 保持开放心态，持续学习和更新认知

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们可以获得更深入的投资洞见，做出更明智的决策。

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
### 现状分析

2024年，全球经济在经历了多年的波动后，似乎进入了一个新的周期。投资者们关注的焦点从短期的市场波动转向了长期的经济趋势。特别是在利率下降的背景下，股市表现出了强劲的回升。S&P 500在利率下降环境下的平均回报率高达14.5%，而在利率上升时，回报率则骤降至0.8%。这一数据不仅揭示了利率对资产价格的“重力”作用，也反映了市场对宏观经济政策的敏感性。

### 个体剖析

对于个体投资者而言，2024年的市场环境提供了新的机遇和挑战。那些能够抓住利率下降趋势的企业，通过提高利润率和收益增长，实现了显著的市值扩张。然而，这背后隐藏的是对宏观经济政策的深度依赖。投资者们不得不重新评估他们的投资策略，以确保在利率波动中保持稳健的收益。

### 群体透视

从更广泛的社会视角来看，AI技术的快速发展正在重塑各行各业。无论是传统企业还是科技公司，都在积极探索如何利用AI提升业务效率和盈利能力。然而，这种技术革命也带来了新的社会问题，如就业结构的变化和数据隐私的挑战。投资者们需要在这些复杂的因素中寻找平衡，以确保他们的投资决策不仅能够带来短期的财务回报，还能够应对长期的社会变革。

### 思考整合

综上所述，2024年的市场环境在宏观经济政策的驱动下，展现出了新的投资机遇。利率的下降为股市提供了强劲的推动力，而AI技术的快速发展则为各行各业带来了新的增长点。然而，投资者们需要警惕这些趋势背后的潜在风险，如利率波动的不可预测性和AI技术带来的社会挑战。只有在深入理解这些复杂因素的基础上，投资者们才能做出明智的决策，确保他们的投资在未来的市场中保持稳健的增长。

[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what we didn't see coming, right?
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see that the supply constraints coming out of COVID was what's going to whack us because we actually were doing okay up until then.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.
[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

分析结果：
让我们从多个角度来解构这段对话：

1. 概念澄清：
- "resilience"在这里特指投资管理中的抗压能力和持续表现能力
- "position sizing"指的是投资组合中单个头寸的规模控制

2. 背景溯源：
- 2022年的市场波动主要源于两个因素：
  * 利率的突然大幅上升
  * COVID后供应链约束的持续影响
- 这些因素对投资管理提出了新的挑战

3. 假设解构：
- 对话中隐含了几个假设：
  * 长期成功的投资者必然具备抗压能力
  * 集中投资策略需要特殊的头寸管理方法
  * 高确信度的投资机会需要特别的进入方式

4. 辩证分析：
- 抗压能力确实重要，但可能不是长期成功的唯一因素
- 集中投资策略既有高回报潜力，也伴随高风险
- 高确信度投资的进入时机和方式需要更细致的策略

5. 建设性观点：
- 投资管理应该建立在对市场环境的深刻理解之上
- 风险管理需要同时考虑宏观因素和微观操作
- 投资决策应该是一个动态调整的过程，而不是一次性决定

这些分析表明，成功的投资管理需要综合运用多种能力，包括环境分析、风险控制和决策执行。单纯依靠某一方面的优势可能难以应对复杂多变的市场环境。

主题：投资理念与估值方法 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

分析结果：
### 现状分析
在这个对话中，我们看到投资者在讨论如何评估一家公司的价值，特别是高增长公司的估值。他们提到了一些指标，如“40法则”，以及如何通过收入增长和现金利润率来判断公司的健康状况。此外，他们还提到了一些具体的公司估值倍数，如30倍和18倍的市盈率。

### 个体剖析
表面上，这些投资者似乎在进行理性的分析，使用各种指标来评估公司的价值。但深入思考，我们会发现，这些指标本身并不能完全反映公司的真实价值。例如，“40法则”虽然提供了一个简单的评估工具，但它忽略了公司的长期战略、市场竞争、管理团队的能力等因素。此外，市盈率虽然是一个常用的估值指标，但它也容易被短期波动所影响，无法全面反映公司的未来潜力。

### 群体透视
从更广泛的社会视角来看，这种对高增长公司的狂热追捧反映了资本市场的短期主义和投机心态。投资者往往被高增长的故事所吸引，而忽视了公司背后的实际经营状况和长期可持续性。这种心态不仅导致市场泡沫的形成，还可能加剧社会的不平等，因为只有少数人能够从这种高风险的投机中获益。

### 思考整合
综合来看，这些投资者虽然在表面上使用各种指标来评估公司价值，但实际上他们的决策往往受到短期利益和市场情绪的影响。真正的价值投资应该更加注重公司的长期潜力和实际经营状况，而不是仅仅依赖于一些简单的财务指标。我们需要警惕这种短视的投机心态，回归到更加理性和可持续的投资理念。

**金句**：指标只是表象，真正的价值在于公司的长期潜力和实际经营状况。

[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
- **Portfolio Management（投资组合管理）**：指通过选择和管理一系列投资工具，以实现特定投资目标的过程。
- **Position Sizing（头寸规模）**：指在投资组合中分配给特定投资的比例或金额。
- **High Conviction Position（高确信度头寸）**：指投资者对其未来表现有高度信心的投资。

### 概念溯源
投资组合管理和头寸规模的概念源于现代投资理论，旨在通过分散投资来降低风险，同时通过集中投资于高确信度的机会来最大化回报。高确信度头寸通常基于深入的研究和明确的投资逻辑。

### 解构假设
1. **高确信度头寸的进入**：假设高确信度头寸的进入是一个逐步的过程，而非一次性决策。这需要持续的市场分析和风险评估。
2. **卖出理由**：假设卖出决策基于明确的框架，包括估值过高、管理层不可信、资本回报率下降和债务过高等因素。
3. **未来复合者的识别**：假设未来复合者需要具备盈利能力、高再投资回报率和长期复合增长的能力。

### 辩证分析
1. **头寸规模的管理**：在管理头寸规模时，投资者需要在集中投资和分散投资之间找到平衡。高确信度头寸可能需要更大的资金投入，但也需要相应的风险管理措施。
2. **卖出框架的合理性**：提出的四个卖出理由（资本回报率下降、估值过高、管理层不可信、债务过高）是合理的，但需要具体量化标准来支持决策。
3. **未来复合者的识别**：识别未来复合者不仅需要分析当前的财务指标，还需要考虑行业趋势、竞争压力和科技变革等外部因素。

### 刷新表述
1. **头寸规模的管理**：高确信度头寸的进入应是一个逐步、基于持续分析和风险评估的过程，而非一次性决策。投资者应制定明确的头寸规模策略，以平衡风险和回报。
2. **卖出框架的优化**：卖出决策应基于量化的标准，例如设定具体的估值倍数、资本回报率阈值和债务水平限制，以确保决策的客观性和一致性。
3. **未来复合者的识别**：识别未来复合者需要综合考虑财务指标和外部环境因素。投资者应建立系统的分析框架，评估企业的盈利能力、再投资回报率和长期增长潜力，同时密切关注行业动态和科技变革的影响。

通过这些系统性怀疑和深入分析，我们可以更清晰地理解投资组合管理中的关键决策点，并制定更为稳健和有效的投资策略。

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段对话中的几个关键概念：

1. **"价值投资"的定义需要澄清**
   - 传统价值投资者与新型投资者的分歧
   - 高估值与"便宜"的相对性
   - 需要明确"价值"的具体衡量标准

2. **"40法则"的应用范围值得质疑**
   - 从科技企业扩展到所有行业的合理性
   - 收入增长与现金利润率相加的数学基础
   - 40%门槛的统计学依据

3. **管理团队评估的主观性**
   - 熟悉度与客观判断的平衡
   - 个人偏好对投资决策的影响
   - 如何量化管理团队的价值

4. **估值倍数的可比性**
   - 不同行业市盈率的差异
   - 高增长与竞争力的溢价
   - 18倍与30倍市盈率背后的驱动因素

通过系统性怀疑，我们可以得出：
- 投资评估需要更全面的指标体系
- 传统规则的应用需要结合具体情境
- 主观判断需要客观数据的支撑
- 估值比较需要考虑行业特性和成长阶段

最终建议：
建立多维度的评估框架，将定量分析与定性判断相结合，在特定语境下应用投资规则，才能做出更理性的投资决策。

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.

[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
1. **宏观投资（Macro Investing）**：指基于对宏观经济因素（如利率、通胀、GDP增长等）的分析来进行投资决策。
2. **利润率（Profit Margins）**：指企业净利润与收入的比率，反映企业的盈利能力。
3. **收益增长（Earnings Growth）**：指企业净利润的增长速度。
4. **倍数扩张（Multiple Expansion）**：指市场对企业估值的提升，通常反映在股价与盈利比（P/E Ratio）的增加。
5. **尾风（Tailwinds）**：指对企业或市场有利的外部因素，如低利率环境。

### 概念溯源
1. **利率与股市表现**：自20世纪60年代以来，历史数据显示，在利率下降的环境中，标普500指数的平均回报率为14.5%，而在利率上升的环境中，回报率仅为0.8%。这一现象与巴菲特的名言“利率对资产价格的影响就像重力对苹果的影响”相呼应。
2. **AI对企业的影响**：AI技术的应用可能通过提高效率、优化运营、增强创新能力等方式，对企业的收入和利润率产生积极影响。

### 解构假设
1. **利率与股市表现的关系**：虽然历史数据显示利率下降与股市表现正相关，但这一关系是否在所有经济环境下都成立？是否存在其他变量（如经济增长、企业盈利等）在同时起作用？
2. **AI对企业的影响**：AI技术的应用是否对所有企业都有相同的积极影响？不同行业、不同规模的企业在应用AI时可能面临哪些挑战？

### 辩证分析
1. **利率与股市表现**：虽然低利率环境通常有利于股市，但高利率环境也可能促使企业提高效率、优化资本结构，从而在长期内提升企业价值。因此，利率变化对股市的影响可能是多方面的。
2. **AI对企业的影响**：AI技术的应用可能对科技企业尤为显著，但传统企业也可能通过AI实现转型和升级。然而，AI的应用需要大量的资本投入和技术积累，这可能对一些中小企业构成挑战。

### 刷新表述
1. **利率与股市表现**：虽然历史数据显示低利率环境有利于股市表现，但投资者应综合考虑经济增长、企业盈利等多重因素，而不仅仅是利率变化。
2. **AI对企业的影响**：AI技术的应用有望通过提高效率和创新能力，对企业的收入和利润率产生积极影响。然而，不同企业在应用AI时可能面临不同的机遇和挑战，投资者应具体分析各企业的AI战略和实施能力。

### 结论
在2024年，企业利润率和收益增长的提升，以及倍数扩张的实现，可能受到低利率环境和AI技术应用的双重推动。然而，投资者应保持审慎，综合考虑多种因素，以做出更为全面和准确的投资决策。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考预算的本质。

1. 演化分析：预算的概念源于人类对资源稀缺性的认知，从最初的简单记录到现代的系统化管理，其核心始终是对有限资源的合理分配。

2. 矛盾分析：预算中的主要矛盾是有限的资源与无限的需求之间的矛盾，这要求我们在满足当前需求和为未来储蓄之间找到平衡。

3. 存在理由：预算存在的根本理由是帮助个体或组织在资源有限的情况下，做出最优的决策，实现财务健康和目标达成。

4. 本质还原：褪去各种预算工具和方法的表象，预算的本质是一种理性的资源分配计划，它反映了我们对价值的判断和优先级的设定。

5. 属和种差：预算是一种财务管理工具（属），其独特之处在于它通过系统化的规划和控制，帮助人们实现财务目标（种差）。

因此，预算的本质是一种理性的资源分配计划，它帮助我们在有限资源条件下做出最优决策，实现财务健康和目标达成。EveryDollar这样的预算工具，正是这一本质在数字时代的具体体现。

[P79] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's my question.
[P80] [SPEAKER_01]: Does your disability prohibit you from being able to make a steady income?
[P81] [SPEAKER_00]: I think I can make like...
[P82] [SPEAKER_00]: $600 a month or something.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Because you'll lose the disability payment?
[P85] [SPEAKER_01]: Disability.
[P86] [SPEAKER_01]: How much is the disability payment?
[P87] [SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[P88] [SPEAKER_01]: But you missed my question, Jessica.
[P89] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying, is there an end to this physical challenge that you will be able to get through through medical care?
[P90] [SPEAKER_01]: Or is this a, I'm trying to understand what you can actually do.
[P91] [SPEAKER_01]: Forget the benefit payment.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: It's permanent disability.
[P94] [SPEAKER_01]: So you are unable to work from home, do a remote job, and work 40 hours a week.
[P95] [SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

[P99] [SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to, this is George, this is a fixed and a very low fixed income.

分析结果：
让我们换个角度思考这个问题：与其关注限制，不如聚焦可能性。虽然身体条件限制了传统工作方式，但在这个数字时代，依然存在许多适合的创收途径。比如：

1. **内容创作**：通过写作、播客或视频分享个人经历，既能帮助他人，也能获得收入。

2. **在线咨询**：利用自身经验，为面临类似挑战的人提供建议和支持。

3. **微任务平台**：参与一些灵活的小任务，如数据标注、简单设计等。

4. **被动收入**：探索投资理财、版权收入等不需要持续投入精力的方式。

5. **技能共享**：将个人特长转化为线上课程或教程。

关键是要找到适合自己的节奏和方式，而不是被"40小时工作制"的传统观念束缚。每个挑战背后都藏着机会，重要的是用创新的视角去发现和把握它们。

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**债务与心理负担的杠杆效应**

#### 核心洞察
偿还债务不仅仅是财务上的解脱，更是一种心理上的释放。当你没有债务时，你的心理负担会大幅减轻，这种心理上的轻松感会转化为更清晰的决策能力和更高的生活质量。

#### 解决步骤
1. **立即行动**：不要拖延，立即偿还债务。拖延只会增加心理负担和利息成本。
2. **预算规划**：制定一个详细的预算，明确每月的固定支出和可变支出。确保你的固定收入能够覆盖这些支出。
3. **心理释放**：想象一下没有债务的生活，这种心理上的轻松感会激励你更加坚定地执行预算和财务计划。
4. **长期规划**：在没有债务的情况下，你可以更自由地规划未来，比如投资、储蓄或其他财务目标。

#### 最终建议
偿还债务不仅是为了财务健康，更是为了心理上的自由。立即行动，制定预算，享受无债一身轻的生活。

[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: This is heading clearly towards divorce because I can't.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Does he know this?

[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: I've already explained this to him.
[P51] [SPEAKER_02]: Is he in La La Land?
[P52] [SPEAKER_02]: Like, does he shut down when you bring any of this up?
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

[P59] [SPEAKER_02]: He's made that very clear on where he stands, and he's not going to change.

[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: So I just been trying to figure out like, how do I separate and insulate myself from that?

[P110] [SPEAKER_02]: And so if you've made it very clear of, hey, this is what it's going to take for this marriage to work, and he's unable to fulfill that, I would be talking to an attorney and figuring out how do I at least protect myself?
[P111] [SPEAKER_02]: How do I begin a phase of separation so that you don't get dragged down with him?

分析结果：
### 观察角度：**系统思维** - 将婚姻视为一个动态系统，分析其不可持续的原因和解决方案

### 分析步骤：
1. **系统诊断**：婚姻系统目前处于失衡状态，一方已明确表达需求，另一方选择回避，导致系统无法正常运转。
2. **反馈机制**：SPEAKER_00已多次尝试沟通，但SPEAKER_02的反馈是“关闭”和“不变”，表明系统缺乏有效反馈回路。
3. **系统边界**：SPEAKER_00意识到需要建立新的边界，以保护自己不被系统的负面能量拖累。
4. **系统重构**：通过法律手段和分居，重新定义系统的边界和规则，确保自身利益和心理健康。

### 解决方案：
1. **明确目标**：SPEAKER_00需要明确自己的底线和需求，确保在分离过程中不被情感绑架。
2. **法律保护**：咨询律师，了解财产分割、抚养权等法律问题，确保自身权益不受损害。
3. **情感隔离**：通过分居或减少接触，逐步从情感上脱离，避免被对方的消极情绪影响。
4. **支持系统**：建立新的支持网络，包括朋友、家人或心理咨询师，帮助自己度过过渡期。

### 最终建议：
婚姻系统已经崩溃，SPEAKER_00需要果断采取行动，通过法律和情感上的双重保护，重新建立自己的生活系统，避免被不可持续的关系拖累。

分析结果：
核心变量提取：
- 债务 (Debt) ≈ 财务负担
- 储蓄 (Savings) ≈ 安全垫
- 固定收入 (Fixed Income) ≈ 有限资源
- 预算 (Budget) ≈ 资源分配计划

逻辑链条构建：
1. 债务 → 财务压力 + 固定收入 ÷ 负担能力 = 财务风险
2. 储蓄 - 债务 = 净财务安全
3. 固定收入 ↔ 预算 = 可持续生活
4. 无债务 + 预算 = 财务稳定

知识精髓提炼：
财务稳定 = (固定收入 * 预算) - 债务 + 储蓄
即：在有限收入下，通过合理预算、消除债务和保持储蓄，构建可持续的财务安全网。

[P6] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's super easy.
[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: He spends and spends and spends.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: He has had to empty his 401k three times to pay off debt that he has accrued.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: He takes out consolidation loans without my consent.
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: He bought a car without my consent.

[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get stuck with these?

[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: He thinks that because he is the breadwinner and he makes all the money and because I'm on disability that he should be able to spend whatever he wants whenever he wants.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: And I...

分析结果：
### 从财务独立的角度切入

1. **设立独立账户**  
   - 立即开设一个仅属于你的银行账户，确保你的收入（如残疾补助）直接存入该账户。  
   - 避免与丈夫的财务混在一起，防止他的消费行为影响你的资金安全。

2. **法律保护**  
   - 咨询律师，了解如何在婚姻中保护你的资产。  
   - 考虑签署婚后协议，明确划分债务责任，避免为他的消费行为买单。

3. **冻结共同信用**  
   - 联系信用机构，冻结你的信用报告，防止他在未经你同意的情况下申请贷款或信用卡。  
   - 监控你的信用报告，及时发现异常。

4. **财务透明与限制**  
   - 要求丈夫提供详细的财务记录，了解他的消费习惯和债务情况。  
   - 设定家庭预算，明确每月支出上限，避免过度消费。

5. **寻求专业帮助**  
   - 建议丈夫接受财务咨询或心理治疗，解决消费成瘾问题。  
   - 如果他不愿意改变，考虑婚姻咨询或分居，以保护自己的财务和心理健康。

6. **长期规划**  
   - 制定个人财务计划，确保你的未来不受他的消费行为影响。  
   - 考虑离婚的可能性，提前准备相关法律和财务文件。

通过以上步骤，你可以逐步隔离和保护好自己，避免被丈夫的消费成瘾拖累。

[P60] [SPEAKER_01]: He's not participating in therapy.

[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's to the, you know, that whole you can lead a horse to water.
[P75] [SPEAKER_01]: Can't make him drink.

分析结果：
### 观察角度：**“水”与“马”的比喻**  
在这个对话中，SPEAKER_00 用了一个经典的比喻：“你可以把马带到水边，但不能强迫它喝水。”这个比喻的核心在于：**你可以提供机会，但无法控制结果**。  

### 简化思路：  
1. **问题本质**：SPEAKER_00 已经努力去接受治疗，但她的伴侣拒绝参与。她感到无力，因为无法强迫对方改变。  
2. **独特视角**：与其纠结于“如何让对方喝水”，不如关注“水的质量”和“马的需求”。  
   - **水的质量**：确保治疗的方式、环境或内容是否适合对方。  
   - **马的需求**：了解对方为什么抗拒治疗，是否有其他方式可以满足他的需求。  
3. **行动建议**：  
   - **调整治疗方式**：也许对方对传统治疗有抵触，可以尝试其他形式，如线上咨询、团体活动或艺术治疗。  
   - **明确需求**：通过沟通了解对方的顾虑，找到他愿意接受的改变方式。  
   - **自我聚焦**：既然无法控制对方，SPEAKER_00 可以专注于自己的成长，提升自己的心理韧性，从而间接影响关系。  

### 一句话总结：  
**“与其强迫马喝水，不如把水变得更甜，或者找到马真正渴的时候。”**

[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and do that.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: I know that cash is very attractive sitting in that savings account, but one of the best things you can do to protect yourself on a very low fixed income is to have no debt.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad she has that, right, George?

[P123] [SPEAKER_02]: That's where I would go sit down and make a budget for yourself based on here's what my expenses would be if I was doing this on my own.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考"债务"这一概念的本质。从演化角度来看，债务源于人类社会的交换需求，最初是物物交换，后来发展为信用关系。其主要矛盾在于即时满足与长期负担之间的张力。从存在主义视角，债务的存在源于人类对未来确定性的追求，以及当下资源与需求的不匹配。通过现象学还原，我们发现债务的本质是一种基于信任的时间价值交换。因此，债务可定义为：一种基于信用关系的、将未来资源转移至当下的价值交换契约。这种本质理解有助于我们更好地处理债务问题，实现财务自由。

[P105] [SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Jessica.
[P106] [SPEAKER_00]: And I've accepted that, but.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个对话的本质。

1. 演化分析：残疾与收入的关系源于人类社会对劳动价值的认定。从原始社会到现代社会，劳动能力始终与生存资源获取直接相关。残疾作为一种劳动能力受限的状态，自然影响收入水平。

2. 矛盾分析：这里存在的主要矛盾是个人生存需求与社会保障制度之间的矛盾。一方面，个人需要维持基本生活；另一方面，社会保障制度设定了收入限制。

3. 存在理由：残疾补助的存在是为了保障弱势群体的基本生存权利，但其限制性条款又可能阻碍个体追求更高生活质量的努力。

4. 本质还原：抛开具体数字和制度细节，核心问题在于如何平衡社会保障与个人发展之间的关系。这是一个关于公平与效率的哲学命题。

5. 属和种差：这是一个关于社会保障制度与个人发展之间关系的讨论。其本质是人类社会如何在保障基本生存权的同时，为个体提供发展空间的社会契约问题。

表象之下，我们看到的不仅是残疾与收入的直接关联，更是人类社会如何在保障与激励之间寻求平衡的永恒课题。这一切真的如我们所见那么简单吗？或许，我们需要更深层地思考社会制度的本质与人性需求的复杂关系。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这段对话的本质。

1. 演化分析：婚姻关系从最初的结合，到出现矛盾，再到无法调和，最终走向分离，这是一个关系演变的自然过程。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于一方对婚姻有明确需求，而另一方无法或不愿满足这些需求，导致关系失衡。

3. 存在理由：婚姻存在的意义在于双方共同维系和成长，当这种共同性消失时，婚姻就失去了存在的基础。

4. 本质还原：褪去情感、责任等表象，婚姻的本质是一种契约关系，当契约无法履行时，解除契约成为必然选择。

5. 属和种差：这是一个关于婚姻关系破裂的对话（属），具体表现为一方意识到关系无法维系，开始考虑法律保护和分离措施（种差）。

对话展现了当婚姻关系无法继续时，理性思考和自我保护的必要性。这反映了人类在面对关系困境时，寻求自我保全的本能。

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **问题核心**：婚姻中的财务失控
   - 丈夫的消费成瘾（Spending Addiction）→ 财务风险（Financial Risk）
   - 未经同意的重大支出（Unauthorized Major Purchases）→ 债务累积（Debt Accumulation）
   - 婚姻财产的法律责任（Marital Property Liability）→ 潜在财务负担（Potential Financial Burden）

2. **关系式**
   - 消费成瘾 * 未经同意的支出 = 债务累积
   - 债务累积 + 婚姻财产 = 潜在财务负担
   - 财务风险 ↔ 婚姻关系紧张

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **消费成瘾的根源**
   - 丈夫的消费行为缺乏节制（Spending Without Restraint）
   - 认为自己是家庭主要收入来源（Breadwinner Mentality）→ 消费自由（Spending Freedom）

2. **财务风险的扩展**
   - 未经同意的贷款和购车（Unauthorized Loans and Car Purchase）→ 高额月供（High Monthly Payments）
   - 401k的多次清空（401k Depletion）→ 退休储蓄的损失（Retirement Savings Loss）

3. **婚姻财产的法律责任**
   - 婚姻期间购买的物品（Marital Purchases）→ 共同财产（Community Property）
   - 潜在的法律责任（Potential Legal Liability）→ 财务负担（Financial Burden）

### 知识精髓提炼
1. **财务隔离的必要性**
   - 建立独立的财务账户（Separate Financial Accounts）→ 财务安全（Financial Security）
   - 法律咨询（Legal Consultation）→ 明确财产责任（Clarify Property Liability）

2. **行为干预的策略**
   - 消费成瘾的治疗（Spending Addiction Treatment）→ 行为改变（Behavioral Change）
   - 财务规划（Financial Planning）→ 长期财务健康（Long-term Financial Health）

3. **婚姻关系的调整**
   - 沟通与协商（Communication and Negotiation）→ 共同决策（Joint Decision-making）
   - 婚姻咨询（Marriage Counseling）→ 关系修复（Relationship Repair）

### 最终洞察
财务失控的婚姻关系需要通过财务隔离、行为干预和婚姻调整三方面来解决，以确保财务安全和关系稳定。

输入内容：
[P1] [SPEAKER_01]: Brought to you by the EveryDollar app.
[P2] [SPEAKER_01]: Start budgeting for free today.

[P126] [SPEAKER_01]: Create your free every dollar budget today.
[P127] [SPEAKER_01]: The simplest way to budget for your life.

分析结果：
**现状分析**  
当今社会，理财App如雨后春笋般涌现，EveryDollar打着“最简单的生活方式预算工具”的旗号，试图吸引那些渴望掌控财务的普通人。广告词简洁明了，甚至有些重复——“免费”“简单”“今天”，仿佛在暗示：只要你下载，就能立刻解决所有财务问题。这种营销手法，像极了那些“快速致富”的课程，让人不禁怀疑：真的这么简单吗？

**个体剖析**  
为什么人们会被这样的广告吸引？因为财务问题往往是现代人最深的焦虑之一。EveryDollar抓住了这一点，用“免费”和“简单”作为诱饵，让人们误以为下载一个App就能摆脱财务困境。但仔细想想，预算真的只是一个工具的问题吗？还是说，更深层次的是我们的消费习惯、生活态度和对金钱的认知？App只是一个工具，而真正的改变，需要的是自律和长期的坚持。但谁愿意承认自己缺乏自律呢？于是，我们更愿意相信，下载一个App就能解决问题。

**群体透视**  
从社会角度看，这类App的流行反映了现代人对“即时满足”的依赖。我们生活在一个追求快速解决方案的时代，无论是减肥、学习还是理财，都希望能找到“一键搞定”的方法。EveryDollar正是抓住了这种心理，将复杂的财务管理简化为“创建预算”的几步操作。然而，这种简化背后，是否掩盖了更深层次的社会问题？比如，为什么这么多人需要预算工具？是因为收入不足，还是因为消费主义盛行？我们是否在用一个工具来掩盖更大的经济困境？

**思考整合**  
EveryDollar这类App的出现，既是现代人财务焦虑的产物，也是消费主义文化的延伸。它们用“免费”和“简单”吸引用户，却未必能真正解决财务问题。真正的预算，需要的不是工具，而是对生活的深刻反思和对金钱的理性态度。下载一个App容易，但改变自己的消费习惯和生活方式，却是一场漫长的修行。所以，下次看到这样的广告，不妨问问自己：我需要的，真的是一个App吗？

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这个问题的本质是什么？

1. 演化分析：从婚姻关系的角度来看，这涉及到财务责任与个人自由的矛盾。婚姻制度最初是为了经济合作和家庭稳定，但现代婚姻中个人主义与集体利益的冲突日益凸显。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于丈夫的个人消费欲望与家庭整体财务安全之间的对立。这种矛盾源于个人主义与集体责任之间的张力。

3. 存在理由：这种状况的存在源于几个前提：丈夫认为作为主要收入来源者有权支配收入；缺乏对共同财务责任的认知；以及可能存在的消费成瘾倾向。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，我们看到的是一个关于权力、责任和界限的问题。核心在于如何在婚姻关系中建立健康的财务界限和权力平衡。

5. 属和种差：这是一个关于婚姻关系中的财务界限问题，具体表现为一方过度消费而另一方寻求自我保护的特殊案例。

本质而言，这是一个关于如何在亲密关系中维护个人财务安全，同时处理权力失衡和成瘾行为的问题。

分析结果：
### 现状分析
在这个对话中，我们看到两个人在讨论如何管理财务，特别是在固定收入有限的情况下。他们强调还清债务的重要性，并建议制定预算以应对可能的财务压力。这种讨论反映了当前社会中许多人面临的财务困境，尤其是在经济不稳定和收入增长缓慢的背景下。

### 个体剖析
对于个体来说，还清债务和制定预算看似是明智的财务决策。然而，这背后隐藏着更深层的动机：对未来的不确定性和对财务安全的渴望。人们往往被眼前的现金吸引，但忽视了长期财务健康的重要性。这种短视行为可能导致更大的财务风险。此外，制定预算不仅仅是为了减少开支，更是为了重新掌控自己的生活，减少对外部因素的依赖。

### 群体透视
从群体视角来看，这种财务建议反映了社会对个人责任的强调。在经济压力下，个体被期望通过自我管理来应对挑战，而不是依赖社会支持或外部援助。这种趋势可能导致社会不平等加剧，因为那些无法有效管理财务的人可能会陷入更深的困境。此外，这种强调个人责任的叙事可能掩盖了结构性问题的存在，如收入不平等和社会保障体系的不足。

### 思考整合
综合来看，还清债务和制定预算是应对财务压力的有效策略，但它们不仅仅是财务管理的工具，更是个体在不确定环境中寻求安全感和控制感的表现。然而，这种个体化的解决方案可能无法解决更深层次的社会经济问题。我们需要在个人财务管理和结构性改革之间找到平衡，才能真正实现财务安全和社会的可持续发展。

**核心洞察**：财务决策不仅仅是数字游戏，它们反映了我们对未来的焦虑和对控制的渴望。然而，真正的财务安全需要个人努力和社会支持的共同作用。

让我们解构这段广告信息：

1. 定义澄清：
- "EveryDollar"被定位为一款预算管理应用
- "Free"暗示无经济成本
- "Simplest way"声称操作便捷性

2. 概念溯源：
- 预算管理概念起源于19世纪的家庭经济管理
- 现代预算App是传统纸质预算的数字化延伸
- "免费"模式通常通过增值服务或广告盈利

3. 假设质疑：
- "最简单"是否经过客观评估？
- "免费"是否包含隐藏成本？
- 该应用是否适合所有用户群体？

4. 辩证分析：
- 便利性 vs 隐私风险
- 免费使用 vs 功能限制
- 标准化模板 vs 个性化需求

5. 刷新认知：
预算工具的选择应基于：
- 个人财务状况的复杂性
- 数据安全考量
- 长期使用成本
- 与个人理财习惯的契合度

建议用户在选择前进行更全面的评估，而非单纯被"免费"和"简单"所吸引。

#### 三条公理
1. **收入与支出平衡公理**：在任何给定的时间内，个人的总收入应至少等于总支出，以维持财务健康。
2. **储蓄与投资增长公理**：通过储蓄和投资，个人可以增加其净财富，实现财务自由和长期目标。
3. **债务最小化公理**：尽量减少债务，特别是高利息债务，以降低财务风险和提高净财富。

### 概念关系图
```
收入 → 支出
收入 → 储蓄
储蓄 → 投资
投资 → 资产
债务 → 负债
资产 - 负债 = 净财富
预算 → 财务目标
```

[P79] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's my question.
[P80] [SPEAKER_01]: Does your disability prohibit you from being able to make a steady income?
[P81] [SPEAKER_00]: I think I can make like...
[P82] [SPEAKER_00]: $600 a month or something.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Because you'll lose the disability payment?
[P85] [SPEAKER_01]: Disability.
[P86] [SPEAKER_01]: How much is the disability payment?
[P87] [SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[P88] [SPEAKER_01]: But you missed my question, Jessica.
[P89] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying, is there an end to this physical challenge that you will be able to get through through medical care?
[P90] [SPEAKER_01]: Or is this a, I'm trying to understand what you can actually do.
[P91] [SPEAKER_01]: Forget the benefit payment.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: It's permanent disability.
[P94] [SPEAKER_01]: So you are unable to work from home, do a remote job, and work 40 hours a week.
[P95] [SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

[P99] [SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to, this is George, this is a fixed and a very low fixed income.
[P100] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: I've had five separate spine surgeries, like just that part of me.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sorry.
[P104] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a mess.
[P105] [SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Jessica.
[P106] [SPEAKER_00]: And I've accepted that, but.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个对话背后的社会现实和个体困境。

首先，我们看到的是一个典型的“残疾陷阱”案例。Jessica因为永久性残疾，每月只能靠600美元的固定收入生活。这让我不禁要问：我们的社会福利系统到底是在帮助人，还是在制造新的困境？当一个人因为残疾而无法工作时，社会给予的救济是否真的足以维持基本生活？更讽刺的是，这种救济反而成了他们无法通过工作改善生活的枷锁。

其次，对话中透露出的绝望感令人心痛。Jessica经历了五次脊柱手术，身体已经“一团糟”。这种长期病痛不仅摧毁了她的身体，更摧毁了她的希望。她说“我已经接受了这个事实”，这句话背后隐藏着多少无奈和心酸？我们社会对残疾人的关怀，是否仅仅停留在物质层面，而忽视了他们的心理需求？

再者，我们看到的是一个被系统困住的个体。Jessica无法从事远程工作，无法通过劳动获得更多收入。这种困境不仅仅是她个人的，更是整个社会的问题。我们创造了一个看似完善的社会保障体系，却让受益者陷入“贫困陷阱”。这是不是一种制度性的暴力？

最后，让我们思考一个更本质的问题：在一个以劳动价值为基础的社会中，那些无法劳动的人该如何生存？我们是否应该重新定义“价值”和“贡献”的概念？也许，真正的文明不在于我们能创造多少财富，而在于我们如何对待那些最脆弱的人群。

这个对话暴露了现代社会的深层矛盾：我们追求效率，却忽视了公平；我们建立制度，却制造了新的不公。Jessica的困境不是一个孤立的案例，而是整个社会结构问题的缩影。我们需要的不是同情，而是反思和改变。

[P75] [SPEAKER_01]: Can't make him drink.

分析结果：
这段对话揭示了现代关系中一个深刻的悖论：我们追求亲密，却在自我救赎的道路上孤军奋战。SPEAKER_00的困境折射出当代亲密关系的普遍困境——一个人可以独自走进治疗室，却无法强迫伴侣一同面对内心的深渊。

这种单方面的努力往往导致关系的失衡。就像SPEAKER_01所说，"你无法替他做这件事"，这句话道出了亲密关系中最残酷的真相：即便我们愿意为对方付出一切，但真正的改变必须来自个体内在的觉醒。

"你可以把马带到水边，但不能强迫它喝水"这句古老的谚语，在现代心理治疗的语境下获得了新的含义。它暗示着，在亲密关系中，我们常常陷入一种救世主情结，试图"拯救"对方，却忽视了每个人都需要为自己的心理健康负责这一基本事实。

更深层次来看，这种单方面的治疗尝试反映了现代社会中个体化进程带来的孤独感。我们越来越注重自我成长，却在这个过程中与伴侣渐行渐远。SPEAKER_00的经历提醒我们，真正的亲密关系需要双方共同投入，共同成长，而不是一个人在前行，另一个人停留在原地。

这段对话最终指向一个令人深思的问题：当一段关系中只有一方愿意寻求帮助和改变时，分离是否真的能成为唤醒对方的契机？或者，这只是现代人在面对亲密关系困境时，又一个无奈的选择？

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话背后的社会现象。表面上，这是一对夫妻在讨论财务问题，但细究之下，暴露了现代婚姻中一个令人不安的现实：婚姻已经变成了一场精打细算的生意。

这位女士花了五年时间，像滚雪球一样一点一点地还债、存钱、投资。她把自己的财务状况打理得井井有条，甚至把债务都分得清清楚楚——"剩下的债务只在他名下"。这种近乎冷酷的财务分割，哪里还有半点婚姻该有的同甘共苦？

更讽刺的是，她提到"理论上法官可能会判一些赡养费，但这不是永久的"。这句话道出了现代婚姻的本质：一场随时可能终止的契约关系。人们不再相信"至死不渝"的誓言，而是早早地为可能的离婚做打算。

这种"财务独立"的婚姻模式，表面上是为了自我保护，实际上却让婚姻失去了最核心的意义——两个人共同面对人生的风雨。当每个人都只想着"这是我的，那是你的"，婚姻就变成了一个空壳，只剩下法律意义上的关系。

我们不得不问：在这个金钱至上的时代，婚姻是否已经沦为一场精心策划的财务游戏？当爱情被数字和合同取代，我们是否正在失去人类最基本的情感连接？

[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and do that.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: I know that cash is very attractive sitting in that savings account, but one of the best things you can do to protect yourself on a very low fixed income is to have no debt.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad she has that, right, George?

[P123] [SPEAKER_02]: That's where I would go sit down and make a budget for yourself based on here's what my expenses would be if I was doing this on my own.

分析结果：
让我们仔细审视这段对话中的关键假设和逻辑：

1. **"无债即安全"的假设**
   - 这一观点隐含地认为债务本身是绝对的负面因素。但我们需要思考：是否存在良性债务？例如，用于投资或教育的债务是否可能带来正向回报？

2. **现金储蓄与债务偿还的对立**
   - 对话将持有现金与偿还债务视为非此即彼的选择。然而，更理性的做法可能是评估：
     - 债务的利率成本
     - 现金储备的必要性
     - 偿还债务的最佳时机和节奏

3. **固定收入的单一视角**
   - 对话仅从固定收入的角度考虑问题，忽视了其他可能性：
     - 增加收入来源的可能性
     - 投资理财的潜在收益
     - 生活方式的弹性调整

4. **预算制定的简化处理**
   - 虽然提到制定预算，但未深入探讨：
     - 预算的具体方法
     - 如何区分必要支出和可选支出
     - 应对突发情况的财务缓冲

5. **情绪因素与理性决策的平衡**
   - "在大脑说服你之前行动"的建议可能忽视了：
     - 深思熟虑的重要性
     - 冲动决策的风险
     - 理性分析与直觉判断的平衡

更全面的建议应该是：
1. 全面评估财务状况，包括资产、负债、收入和支出
2. 计算不同选择的成本收益，如债务利率与投资回报
3. 建立应急基金，保持一定的流动性
4. 制定动态的财务计划，定期评估和调整
5. 在确保基本生活的前提下，探索增加收入的可能性

这样的分析不仅考虑短期债务问题，更着眼于长期的财务健康和可持续发展。

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确“therapy”在这里的具体含义。是个人心理治疗，还是夫妻共同参与的治疗？这两者有本质区别。

### 概念溯源
治疗作为一种心理干预手段，起源于20世纪初的精神分析学派。夫妻治疗则更强调双方共同参与，解决关系中的问题。

### 解构假设
对话中隐含了几个假设：
1. 个人治疗等同于夫妻治疗。
2. 一方参与治疗就能改善关系。
3. 分离是解决问题的唯一途径。

### 辩证分析
从不同视角看：
- 个人治疗确实有助于自我成长，但未必直接改善关系。
- 夫妻治疗需要双方共同参与，单方面努力效果有限。
- 分离可能是最后手段，但并非唯一选择。

### 刷新表述
通过系统性怀疑，我们可以得出更清晰的认知：
1. 区分个人治疗与夫妻治疗的重要性。
2. 强调双方共同参与的必要性。
3. 探索除分离外的其他可能性，如沟通技巧培训或关系辅导。

最终结论：治疗是改善关系的重要手段，但需要双方共同参与和努力。单方面治疗虽有益，但无法替代夫妻共同治疗的作用。在考虑分离之前，应尝试其他可能的解决方案。

[P111] [SPEAKER_02]: How do I begin a phase of separation so that you don't get dragged down with him?

分析结果：
### 现状分析
这段对话揭示了一个婚姻关系中的严重裂痕。一方已经明确表达了无法继续维持这段关系的立场，而另一方似乎选择了逃避和拒绝面对现实。这种沟通的断裂和不作为，让婚姻变得“不可持续”。

### 个体剖析
**SPEAKER_00** 显然已经走到了极限。她尝试过沟通，但对方（“他”）选择了“关闭”和逃避。这种逃避不仅仅是拒绝回应，更是对婚姻责任的放弃。她现在的挣扎是如何“分离”和“保护自己”，这反映出她已经开始为可能的离婚做准备。她的动机很明确：不再被这段关系拖垮。

而“他”的行为则更加令人不安。他不仅拒绝面对问题，甚至可能生活在一种自我欺骗的“La La Land”中。这种逃避不仅仅是情感上的疏离，更是一种对现实责任的彻底放弃。他的不作为实际上是一种无声的宣告：他不愿意为这段婚姻付出任何努力。

### 群体透视
这种婚姻中的沟通断裂和逃避行为，在现代社会中并不罕见。随着个体主义的崛起，越来越多的人在面对婚姻中的问题时选择逃避，而不是共同解决。这种“逃避文化”背后，隐藏着更深层次的社会问题：我们对承诺的轻视，对责任的恐惧，以及对个人利益的过度关注。

婚姻本应是两个人共同面对生活的挑战，但当一方选择逃避，另一方就不得不独自承担所有的压力和痛苦。这种不平等的关系模式，最终只会导致关系的崩溃。而在这个过程中，逃避者往往不会意识到自己的行为对对方造成的伤害，直到一切为时已晚。

### 思考整合
这段对话的核心洞察是：**逃避无法解决问题，只会加速关系的崩溃**。SPEAKER_00 已经意识到这一点，她开始为可能的分离做准备，这是一种自我保护的本能。而“他”的逃避行为，则是一种对现实的拒绝，这种拒绝最终只会让他失去一切。

婚姻中的沟通和责任感是维系关系的基石。当一方选择逃避，另一方就必须做出艰难的决定：是继续被拖垮，还是勇敢地选择分离？SPEAKER_00 的选择是明智的，她不再等待对方的改变，而是开始为自己的未来做打算。这是一种觉醒，也是一种解脱。

**金句**：逃避是婚姻的慢性毒药，而分离则是解药。

分析结果：
让我们从多个角度来审视这段对话：

1. **定义澄清**
   - "永久性残疾"的具体含义需要明确：是身体功能完全丧失，还是部分受限？
   - "固定收入"的构成：仅指残疾补助，还是包含其他收入来源？

2. **假设解构**
   - 对话隐含假设：残疾必然导致工作能力完全丧失。这个假设是否成立？
   - 另一个假设：远程工作对残疾人士来说都是不可行的。这个假设是否过于绝对？

3. **辩证分析**
   - 从医疗角度：五次脊柱手术是否意味着完全丧失工作能力？是否有康复或辅助技术的可能？
   - 从社会角度：是否存在适合残疾人士的灵活就业机会？社会支持系统是否完善？
   - 从个人角度：当事人是否已经尝试过所有可能的就业途径？是否有未开发的潜能？

4. **新的认知**
   - 残疾与就业能力之间的关系是复杂的，不能简单划等号
   - 需要更全面地评估个人的具体情况，包括身体状况、技能、兴趣等
   - 社会应该提供更多元化的就业支持，帮助残疾人士实现自我价值

5. **建设性建议**
   - 建议进行全面的职业能力评估，寻找适合的工作机会
   - 探索辅助技术和灵活工作安排的可能性
   - 寻求职业培训和心理咨询等支持服务

通过这种系统性的质疑和分析，我们可以对残疾与就业问题有更深入和全面的理解，从而找到更有效的解决方案。

[P19] [SPEAKER_01]: This scares me.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: He has no concept of it.

[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: My fear is always the stuff that he's buying, like cars and all this stuff, because they were obtained during marriage.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get stuck with these?

[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: He thinks that because he is the breadwinner and he makes all the money and because I'm on disability that he should be able to spend whatever he wants whenever he wants.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: And I...

分析结果：
让我们深入思考这个问题。表面上看，这是一个关于财务管理和婚姻关系的故事，但背后隐藏着更深层的社会和心理问题。

首先，这个丈夫的行为不仅仅是“花钱成瘾”，更是一种权力和控制的表现。他自诩为“养家糊口的人”，用收入作为控制妻子的工具。这种行为折射出社会中根深蒂固的性别不平等观念——谁赚钱，谁就有决定权。这种思维模式不仅伤害了婚姻关系，更是一种对伴侣人格的漠视。

其次，这种无节制的消费行为背后，可能是对现实生活的逃避。他通过购物来填补内心的空虚，用物质来证明自己的价值。这种行为在现代社会中并不罕见，我们生活在一个鼓励消费的时代，广告无孔不入，社交媒体不断展示“理想生活”，让人们陷入永无止境的物质追求中。

再者，这位妻子的处境也值得我们深思。她因为残疾而处于经济弱势地位，这让她在婚姻中失去了话语权。这暴露出社会保障体系的不足——一个残疾人，即便是婚姻中的一方，也应该有独立的经济保障，而不是完全依赖配偶。

最后，这段关系中的沟通问题同样令人担忧。丈夫无视妻子的反对，擅自做出重大财务决定，这不仅是财务问题，更是对婚姻承诺的背叛。婚姻应该是建立在相互尊重和共同决策的基础上，而不是一个人独断专行。

思考到这里，我们不禁要问：在这个物欲横流的时代，我们是否都成了消费主义的奴隶？在追求物质满足的过程中，我们是否忽视了更重要的情感联系和人性尊严？这段婚姻的困境，或许正是整个社会病态的一个缩影。

主题：婚姻关系中的财务隔离 - doubt

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: snowball method so I have been spending the last five years like doing anything that's associated with me and I have like simultaneously been paying off and saving and I've paid off so far $31,751.84 and
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: I have $19,391.17 in cash saved.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: Do you have separate accounts?
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: $9,608.14 in investment saved.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: And I have $6,005.43 left in debt, like on credit cards.

[P37] [SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any debt that's in your name beyond that, or is the rest in his name only?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: The rest is only in his name.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be his problem.

[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: You've already separated finances.

[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: And then with what I have saved and what I have like investment wise, like in theory, I know that a judge or whatever would maybe do some type of spousal support, but I know that's not guaranteed and it's not for forever.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: But I have an income of $1,054 a month from disability.

分析结果：
让我们仔细分析这个财务状况：

1. 定义澄清：
- "snowball method" 通常指债务偿还策略，但这里似乎用于描述整体财务管理
- "separate accounts" 需要明确是完全独立的账户，还是仅名义上分开

2. 概念溯源：
- 财务分离通常在离婚或分居时进行
- 这里的债务分配涉及法律和道德双重考量

3. 解构假设：
- 假设1：债务仅以个人名义存在就完全属于个人责任
  - 质疑：在某些司法管辖区，婚姻期间产生的债务可能被视为共同债务
- 假设2：现有储蓄和投资足以支撑未来生活
  - 质疑：需要计算具体生活成本和长期财务可持续性

4. 辩证分析：
- 正面：主动管理财务，已有相当储蓄和投资
- 反面：收入来源单一且金额有限，长期财务安全存疑

5. 建设性建议：
建议采取以下行动：
1) 咨询专业律师，明确债务责任划分
2) 制定详细的长期财务规划，考虑通货膨胀等因素
3) 探索增加收入的可能性，如兼职或技能提升
4) 重新评估投资组合，确保与风险承受能力匹配

关键问题：
- 当前财务安排是否真正独立且可持续？
- 是否考虑了所有潜在的法律和财务风险？

建议进一步收集信息，进行全面评估。

主题：离婚可能性探讨 - doubt

输入内容：
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: This is heading clearly towards divorce because I can't.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Does he know this?
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: It's so unsustainable.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: I've already explained this to him.
[P51] [SPEAKER_02]: Is he in La La Land?
[P52] [SPEAKER_02]: Like, does he shut down when you bring any of this up?
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

[P59] [SPEAKER_02]: He's made that very clear on where he stands, and he's not going to change.

[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: So I just been trying to figure out like, how do I separate and insulate myself from that?

[P110] [SPEAKER_02]: And so if you've made it very clear of, hey, this is what it's going to take for this marriage to work, and he's unable to fulfill that, I would be talking to an attorney and figuring out how do I at least protect myself?
[P111] [SPEAKER_02]: How do I begin a phase of separation so that you don't get dragged down with him?

分析结果：
让我们对这个对话进行系统性分析：

1. **定义澄清**
   - "离婚"在这里似乎被定义为关系的不可持续状态
   - "La La Land"隐喻对方的逃避现实态度

2. **概念溯源**
   - 对话显示SPEAKER_00已多次尝试沟通
   - SPEAKER_02观察到对方立场明确且不愿改变

3. **假设解构**
   - 隐含假设：持续沟通无效意味着关系无法修复
   - 潜在前提：保护自己是分离的首要考量

4. **辩证分析**
   - 正面：意识到关系困境并寻求解决方案
   - 反面：是否所有沟通途径都已尝试？
   - 综合：在保护自己的同时，是否还有修复关系的可能？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 当关系陷入僵局，且一方明确拒绝改变时，考虑分离是理性的选择
   - 寻求法律建议以保护自身权益，是面对不可持续关系时的必要步骤
   - 同时，需要评估所有可能的解决方案，确保决策的全面性

最终结论：在面对不可调和的关系困境时，采取保护性措施并寻求专业建议是明智之举，但在此之前，应确保所有可能的沟通和修复尝试都已充分进行。

输入内容：
[P3] [SPEAKER_00]: How do I insulate and separate myself from my husband who has a massive spending addiction?
[P4] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[P5] [SPEAKER_01]: Can you describe that briefly to us?
[P6] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's super easy.
[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: He spends and spends and spends.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: He has had to empty his 401k three times to pay off debt that he has accrued.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: He takes out consolidation loans without my consent.
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: He bought a car without my consent.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The payment for that is almost $1,000 a month.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[P14] [SPEAKER_00]: And it just goes and goes and goes.

[P16] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, years.

[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: And I...

分析结果：
让我们从几个关键角度来解构这个问题：

1. **定义问题**：这里涉及的是婚姻中的财务控制与责任分配问题，核心是配偶的消费成瘾行为对婚姻关系和个人利益的威胁。

2. **溯源分析**：
   - 经济基础：丈夫作为主要收入来源，认为自己有完全的支配权
   - 权力结构：妻子处于经济依赖状态，缺乏制衡能力
   - 行为模式：丈夫的消费行为已经形成成瘾性循环

3. **解构假设**：
   - 假设1：主要收入者拥有完全的财务支配权
   - 假设2：婚姻中的债务可以无条件共同承担
   - 假设3：消费成瘾问题可以通过劝说解决

4. **辩证思考**：
   - 法律层面：需要了解婚姻财产与债务的分配规则
   - 心理层面：消费成瘾是一种需要专业干预的行为问题
   - 关系层面：需要重新建立健康的财务边界

5. **建设性建议**：
   - 立即采取法律保护措施，如设立独立账户、进行财产分割
   - 寻求专业财务顾问和法律咨询
   - 考虑婚姻咨询或单独的心理咨询
   - 建立明确的财务协议和预算制度

关键结论：这不是一个简单的消费习惯问题，而是涉及法律、心理和关系的复杂议题，需要系统性解决方案。被动等待或单纯劝说无法解决问题，必须采取积极主动的保护措施。

分析结果：
从历史视角来看，播客的开场白其实和传统电台节目如出一辙。只不过，现代播客用更亲密的语气和更直接的互动方式，让听众感觉像是在和朋友聊天。这种"假装我们很熟"的策略，巧妙地拉近了主持人和听众的距离，让商业话题也变得不那么枯燥了。

简化思维一下，整个开场其实就做了三件事：
1. 介绍节目名称和主题
2. 介绍主持人
3. 营造轻松氛围

这种结构经过多年验证，是最有效率的开场方式。它像是一个精心设计的"社交开场白"，让听众在最短时间内了解节目，同时产生继续听下去的兴趣。

分析结果：
从极限思考的角度来看，技术手册的编写就像为混乱的战场绘制一张逃生地图。当项目陷入混沌时，手册就是那盏指引方向的明灯。它不仅是操作步骤的集合，更是将复杂系统简化为可执行指令的艺术。在项目启动初期，制定清晰的手册相当于为未来的自己铺设一条逃生通道，让混乱变得可控，让复杂变得简单。这就是为什么在混沌中，技术手册能成为最令人兴奋的话题——它代表着从无序到有序的希望。

2. **反馈**：鼓励听众留下评价，获取市场反馈
3. **传播**：引导听众分享，实现口碑营销

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于商业运作中的恐惧与自由之间的对立。播客试图通过分享经验和策略，帮助听众克服恐惧，获得商业自由。

3. 存在理由：这个播客存在的理由是为商业主提供指导和支持，帮助他们建立和发展自己的事业。其前提是商业主需要专业知识和心理支持来应对挑战。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，这段对话的本质是一个商业指导节目的开场白。它旨在介绍节目内容，建立主持人与听众之间的联系，并设定节目基调。

5. 属和种差：这段对话属于商业播客开场白的范畴，其种差在于它强调从恐惧到自由的转变，并由兄弟搭档主持，这为其增添了独特的亲和力和可信度。

[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.

从极限思考的角度来看，将复杂任务简化为标准化操作流程（SOP）的过程，其实就像是在玩拼图游戏。你不需要一开始就试图拼出整幅画面，而是从最容易找到的那块拼图开始。这块拼图可能不是最重要的，但它的简单性让你能够快速获得成就感，从而激发继续拼图的动力。随着时间的推移，你会发现自己已经不知不觉地拼出了整幅画面。这种“雪球效应”不仅适用于债务管理，同样适用于系统化建设。所以，不要被复杂的任务吓倒，从最简单的开始，让雪球慢慢滚大。

输入内容：
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**"任务进化论"**

想象一下，你手中的每一项任务都是一个生物体，它们需要经历从"原始状态"到"高度进化"的过程。这个进化过程可以分为三个阶段：

1. **原始阶段（手动处理）**
   - 任务刚出现，需要你亲自处理
   - 就像单细胞生物，简单但效率低
   - 例子：亲自编写每封邮件

2. **进化阶段（流程化）**
   - 任务开始形成固定模式
   - 像多细胞生物，开始分工协作
   - 例子：制定邮件模板，委托他人处理

3. **高级阶段（自动化）**
   - 任务完全系统化，无需人工干预
   - 如同高等生物，拥有复杂但高效的运作机制
   - 例子：自动生成并发送标准化邮件

**应用方法：**
1. 识别当前任务所处的进化阶段
2. 制定相应的"进化策略"：
   - 原始阶段：积累经验，观察规律
   - 进化阶段：建立流程，培养执行者
   - 高级阶段：开发工具，实现自动化
3. 持续推动任务向更高阶段进化

**关键洞察：**
- 不要试图让所有任务都立即达到高级阶段
- 保留需要判断力的任务在原始阶段，这是你的核心价值所在
- 将重复性任务尽快推进到高级阶段，释放你的精力

记住：任务进化的终极目标是让你专注于只有你能做的事情，而将其他事情交给系统或他人。这就像生物进化一样，是一个持续优化的过程，需要耐心和策略。

主题：创始人如何重新参与销售流程 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**“信任的转移”**

CEO的角色从“执行者”向“系统构建者”转变，核心在于如何将个人判断和决策能力逐步转移给团队。这个过程就像“信任的转移”，需要CEO从“唯一可信赖的人”变成“信任他人的人”。

### 解决步骤：
1. **重新进入销售环节**  
   - 目的：亲自体验流程，发现问题，形成系统化的判断标准。  
   - 行动：CEO回到销售一线，观察并记录关键决策点。

2. **系统化与SOP制定**  
   - 目的：将个人经验转化为可复制的流程。  
   - 行动：基于观察，制定销售流程和标准操作程序（SOP），确保团队能够执行。

3. **“除草”与优先级管理**  
   - 目的：聚焦核心任务，避免资源浪费。  
   - 行动：识别并停止低效或无意义的任务，将精力集中在系统构建和团队培训上。

4. **信任的逐步转移**  
   - 目的：培养团队独立决策能力。  
   - 行动：通过SOP和系统，逐步将决策权交给长期员工和高管，建立信任机制。

### 核心洞察：
CEO的成功不在于永远做“唯一可信赖的人”，而在于如何将这种信任和能力转移给团队，让系统和人共同驱动公司发展。

[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.
[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.
[P655] [SPEAKER_00]: The goals, actions, metrics, and execution, and really the execution is the SOP.
[P656] [SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the teaser for next episode or next couple episodes coming up.
[P657] [SPEAKER_00]: That's another episode of the Build Your Business podcast with Matt and Chris Reynolds.
[P658] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, things are going great.
[P659] [SPEAKER_00]: Rankings are awesome.
[P660] [SPEAKER_00]: Would love for you to share this with a friend or family member.
[P661] [SPEAKER_00]: Five-star review or honest review anywhere you listen to your podcast.
[P662] [SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody about it.
[P663] [SPEAKER_00]: Share it on social media.
[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个对话的本质。从演化角度来看，播客作为一种新兴的媒体形式，延续了传统广播的互动性，同时增加了更深入的专题讨论。这种形式的本质在于通过对话传递知识和观点，同时建立听众与主持人之间的连接。

从矛盾分析来看，这里存在内容深度与时间限制的矛盾，以及信息传递与听众参与的矛盾。主持人需要在有限时间内传递足够有价值的信息，同时激发听众的参与和分享。

从存在主义角度，这个播客存在的理由在于为听众提供商业建设的实用建议，同时也为主持人建立个人品牌和影响力。它的前提是听众对商业知识的需求，以及主持人专业知识的可信度。

通过现象学还原，褪去具体的对话内容，我们可以看到这个对话的本质是一个精心设计的知识传播过程，包含了信息传递、互动引导和品牌推广等多个维度。

属和种差定义：这是一个商业类播客的结束语，其本质是通过结构化的话语引导，实现知识传递、听众互动和品牌推广的多重目标。

主题：系统与SOP的持续优化 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.

分析结果：
把复杂问题拆解成简单步骤，就像健身训练一样：从最基础的线性进步开始，逐步增加难度。创业初期，你亲力亲为，列出所有任务清单。随着业务增长，将简单任务系统化，交给初级员工执行。用科学方法测试系统有效性，不断优化。关键在于迈出第一步，从最简单的系统开始建立。就像健身，从举5磅开始，逐步增加重量，但始终保持系统尽可能简单。

主题：客户生命周期与SOP的应用 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.

主题：讨论系统与标准操作流程的重要性 - essence

输入内容：
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。系统和标准操作程序，它们究竟为何存在？

从演化角度看，系统源于人类对秩序和效率的追求。在混沌中，人类本能地寻求结构和规律，这种需求推动了系统的诞生。系统本质上是一种将复杂现实简化为可管理模块的认知工具。

矛盾分析揭示，系统的主要矛盾在于其刚性与现实多变性的对立。系统试图建立稳定秩序，而现实却永远处于流动变化之中。这种矛盾促使系统不断进化，以适应新的挑战。

从存在主义视角看，系统存在的理由在于它为人提供了确定性和可预测性。在充满不确定性的世界中，系统成为人类对抗焦虑的庇护所。它给予我们掌控感和方向感，使行动变得可能。

现象学还原让我们看到，系统的本质是一种认知框架。它并非客观存在，而是人类思维对现实的抽象和重构。系统通过简化复杂现实，使其变得可理解和可操作。

因此，系统可定义为：人类为应对复杂性而构建的认知框架，旨在通过结构化方法实现秩序与效率。其属为认知工具，种差在于其结构化与秩序化的特征。

主题：创始人如何逐步移交SOP - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.

主题：SOP的自动化与维护 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

分析结果：
从这段对话中，我们可以提炼出一个独特的观察角度：**企业运营就像一场接力赛，每个关键节点都需要明确的责任人和顺畅的交接**。具体来说：

1. **激活阶段**：由COO负责，重点是将新客户从转化阶段顺利过渡到完全投入使用系统。这需要清晰的上手流程和持续的客户沟通。

2. **获取阶段**：由CMO主导，涵盖从潜在客户到转化的全过程。CEO亲自参与转化环节，确保系统完善。

3. **扩展与留存阶段**：由CXO负责，专注于提升客户生命周期价值。

这种接力式的责任分配确保了每个关键环节都有专人负责，同时通过明确的交接点保证流程的连贯性。这不仅提高了效率，也使得企业能够更好地应对市场变化和客户需求。

[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.

主题：如何通过手动流程验证SOP - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

主题：创始人如何管理任务与系统 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

分析结果：
从“时间管理”的角度来看，创始人面临的核心问题其实是“任务边界模糊”和“职责划分不清”。这就像在玩一个永远没有终点的俄罗斯方块游戏，随着公司规模的扩大，任务会不断堆积，而创始人需要不断调整自己的角色和职责。

**独特的观察角度：将创始人的任务管理比作“俄罗斯方块”游戏**

1. **游戏规则**：俄罗斯方块的规则是不断消除堆积的方块，而创始人的任务是不断调整和优化自己的职责，以适应公司的发展阶段。
2. **任务堆积**：就像俄罗斯方块中不断下落的方块，创始人的任务也会随着公司的发展而不断增加。如果不及时处理，任务会堆积到无法承受的地步。
3. **消除策略**：在俄罗斯方块中，玩家需要通过旋转和移动方块来消除堆积。创始人则需要通过“任务委派”和“流程优化”来消除任务堆积。
4. **游戏节奏**：俄罗斯方块的节奏会随着游戏的进行而加快，创始人的工作节奏也会随着公司的发展而加快。这需要创始人不断调整自己的策略，以适应新的节奏。
5. **游戏失败**：在俄罗斯方块中，如果方块堆积到顶部，游戏就结束了。对于创始人来说，如果任务堆积到无法处理的地步，可能会导致公司运营出现问题。

**解决步骤：**
1. **识别任务**：首先，创始人需要明确哪些任务是必须由自己完成的，哪些任务可以委派给他人。
2. **委派任务**：将可以委派的任务交给合适的团队成员，确保他们有足够的资源和能力来完成这些任务。
3. **建立流程**：为重复性任务建立标准化的流程和“操作手册”，以便团队成员能够高效地执行这些任务。
4. **定期调整**：随着公司的发展，定期审视和调整自己的职责和任务分配，确保自己始终处于最需要的位置。
5. **保持节奏**：像俄罗斯方块玩家一样，保持对任务堆积的敏感度，及时调整策略，避免任务堆积到无法处理的地步。

通过这种“俄罗斯方块”式的任务管理方法，创始人可以更有效地应对职责模糊和任务堆积的问题，确保公司能够持续健康发展。

主题：如何通过视频创建SOP - perspectives

输入内容：
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.

分析结果：
从对话中提炼出的核心观点是：在自动化之前，先确保手动流程的正确性。这个看似简单的建议，实际上蕴含着一个深刻的管理哲学——**“慢即是快”**。

我们可以用一个简单的比喻来理解这个观点：**建房子要先打地基**。想象一下，如果你急于建造一座高楼，却忽略了地基的稳固性，结果会怎样？整座建筑可能会倒塌，所有的努力都会白费。同样地，在商业流程中，自动化就像是高楼，而手动流程的验证和完善就是地基。

通过先手动执行流程，我们可以：
1. **发现问题**：在手动操作中更容易发现流程中的漏洞和不足。
2. **验证效果**：确保流程确实能够解决问题，而不是制造新的问题。
3. **优化设计**：在手动阶段不断调整和优化，为自动化打下坚实的基础。

这种“先慢后快”的策略，实际上是一种**风险管理**。它避免了在自动化过程中投入大量资源后才发现流程本身存在问题，从而节省了时间和成本。

所以，下次当你急于自动化某个流程时，不妨先问问自己：**“这个流程的手动版本真的已经完美了吗？”** 如果答案是否定的，那就先花时间把手动流程打磨好，再考虑自动化。这样，你最终会得到一个更高效、更可靠的系统。

[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

分析结果：
### 简化视角：将复杂流程类比为日常生活中的简单任务

想象一下，你正在做一道菜。菜谱上详细列出了每一步的操作，从准备食材到烹饪时间，再到最后的调味。这就是一个标准的操作流程（SOP）。无论是公司战略部署，还是家具组装，甚至是孩子的家务清单，都可以类比为这个简单的菜谱。

**核心步骤：**
1. **列出所有步骤**：就像菜谱中的每一步，确保每个任务都有明确的指示。
2. **设定明确的目标**：比如“当饼皮变成浅棕色，内部温度达到X度”时，任务完成。
3. **简化执行**：确保每个步骤都尽可能简单易懂，就像IKEA的家具组装说明书。
4. **动态调整**：像教练在比赛中根据情况调整战术一样，随时根据反馈优化流程。

**应用场景：**
- **公司战略**：将复杂的战略分解为具体的行动步骤，每个部门都有明确的“菜谱”。
- **项目管理**：像组装家具一样，按照步骤一步步推进，确保每个环节都按计划完成。
- **家庭教育**：给孩子制定清晰的家务清单，让他们知道每一步该做什么，完成后可以得到奖励。

**总结：**
无论是企业管理还是日常生活，将复杂任务简化为清晰的步骤，并设定明确的目标和反馈机制，就能像做菜一样轻松应对各种挑战。

[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.

[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.

[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.

分析结果：
构建高管团队，本质上是在玩一场“拼图游戏”。创始人需要找到那些能填补自己短板的人，就像拼图时寻找缺失的那一块。但这里有个有趣的视角：高管团队不仅要在能力上互补，更要在“热爱”上互补。创始人需要识别出那些自己既不在行、也不感兴趣的关键领域，然后找到那些对这些领域充满热情的人。这就像在拼图中，每一块都有它独特的色彩和图案，共同构成一幅完整的画面。

此外，CEO在某些关键时刻需要“脱下帽子”，亲自上阵。这并不意味着失败，而是灵活应对的智慧。就像在拼图过程中，有时需要暂时放下整体视角，专注于某个局部细节，才能推动整个拼图向前。这种灵活性，恰恰体现了领导力的成熟度。

所以，构建高管团队的艺术在于：既要找到能填补自己短板的人，又要保持足够的灵活性，在关键时刻能够亲自上阵。这就像拼图游戏，既需要整体规划，又需要局部专注，最终才能拼出一幅完美的作品。

主题：创始人如何重新参与销售流程 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
- **CEO角色类型** ≈ 销售CEO + 技术CEO + 工程CEO
- **销售CEO任务** → 回归销售周期 + 系统与SOP（标准操作程序）的重新审视 + 团队培训
- **目标设定** ↔ 年度重要目标 + 去除无关任务
- **创始人信任** → 初始信任自己 + 随时间信任他人（长期员工/高管）
- **任务分配** ≈ 写系统与SOP + 任务移交

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **CEO角色类型** ≈ 销售CEO + 技术CEO + 工程CEO → 不同CEO类型对应不同核心任务
2. **销售CEO任务** → 回归销售周期 + 系统与SOP的重新审视 + 团队培训 → 确保销售流程优化与团队能力提升
3. **目标设定** ↔ 年度重要目标 + 去除无关任务 → 聚焦核心业务，提升效率
4. **创始人信任** → 初始信任自己 + 随时间信任他人（长期员工/高管） → 逐步建立对团队的信任，实现任务移交
5. **任务分配** ≈ 写系统与SOP + 任务移交 → 通过系统化与标准化，实现任务的有效分配与执行

### 知识精髓提炼
CEO的角色类型决定了其核心任务，销售CEO需回归销售周期，重新审视系统与SOP，并培训团队。目标设定需聚焦年度重要目标，去除无关任务。创始人初始信任自己，随时间逐步信任他人，通过写系统与SOP实现任务移交。

[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。

1. 演化分析：系统化思维的演进源于工业革命后对效率的追求，从泰勒科学管理到现代SOP，体现了人类对复杂性的掌控欲望。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于个人创造力与系统标准化之间的张力。创始人往往认为自己的决策具有不可复制的独特性，而系统化则强调可重复性。

3. 存在理由：系统化存在的根本原因在于人类认知的有限性和组织规模的扩张需求。它试图将经验转化为可传承的知识。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，系统化的本质是一种认知工具，旨在将隐性知识显性化，将直觉判断转化为可操作的步骤。

5. 属和种差：系统化是一种组织管理方法（属），其特点是将复杂任务分解为可重复执行的标准化流程（种差）。

[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**“双重身份”的超级力量**

Barbell Logic 和 Turnkey Coaches 的成功秘诀在于他们既是教练又是客户，这种双重身份让他们能够从两个关键角度审视问题：**用户体验**和**产品设计**。这种“自产自销”的模式让他们能够快速发现并解决问题，同时也能更精准地满足客户需求。

### 简化步骤：
1. **成为你的客户**：像 Barbell Logic 一样，亲自使用你的产品或服务，体验客户的全流程。这能让你发现那些隐藏在表面下的痛点。
2. **站在客户的角度思考**：当客户反馈问题时，不要只是记录，而是亲自去解决。比如，手动处理客户的痛点，直到你找到自动化的解决方案。
3. **建立反馈闭环**：通过双重身份，你可以在产品设计和客户体验之间形成一个高效的反馈闭环，快速迭代优化。
4. **培养“主人翁”思维**：无论是高管还是员工，都需要具备“站在客户角度解决问题”的意识和能力。这需要高度的判断力和责任感。

### 核心洞察：
**“吃自己的狗粮”**（即使用自己的产品）不仅是一种测试手段，更是一种战略优势。它能让你在产品设计和客户体验之间建立无缝连接，从而打造出真正解决用户痛点的产品和服务。这种双重身份的优势，是大多数科技公司无法企及的。

主题：SOP的持续更新与团队责任 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

分析结果：
### 简化视角：**"进化式优化"**
1. **先手动验证**：确保流程在手动状态下完美运行，再考虑自动化。
2. **持续迭代**：SOP（标准操作流程）是“活的”，需要随着技术、客户需求和业务发展不断调整，但每次只需微调（2%-5%），避免大规模变动。
3. **逐步改进**：通过小步迭代，让流程逐渐优化，而不是一次性大改，这样资源投入更可控。
4. **找到对的人**：将SOP交给擅长的人执行，尤其是那些热爱这项工作的人，他们可能比你做得更好。
5. **接受局限**：承认自己并非全能，专注于自己擅长的领域，将不擅长的部分交给更专业的人。

### 核心洞察：
**"优化不是一蹴而就，而是通过小步迭代和找到对的人，让流程和团队持续进化。"**  
这种进化式优化不仅降低了风险，还能让资源投入更高效，最终实现业务的长期成功。

[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
### 简化思维：将复杂流程转化为清晰步骤

在这个对话中，核心问题是如何确保员工真正拥有并能够改进标准操作流程（SOP）。通过简化思维，我们可以将这个问题分解为几个关键步骤：

1. **明确所有权**：确保员工理解他们现在拥有这个流程，并且有责任对其进行改进。
2. **文档化变更**：所有变更必须记录在正式文档中，以确保透明性和可追溯性。
3. **定期跟进**：通过一对一会议，定期审查和讨论SOP的变更，确保流程的持续优化。
4. **建立信任文化**：通过赋予员工真正的所有权，激发他们的责任感和自豪感，从而提升整体工作效率和质量。

### 系统思维：将SOP置于公司整体运营中

从系统思维的角度来看，SOP不仅仅是一个操作手册，它是公司运营体系中的一个关键组成部分。通过将SOP与公司的整体战略和文化相结合，可以确保每个员工都理解他们的工作如何影响公司的整体目标。这种系统化的方法有助于减少信息孤岛，防止关键知识被个别员工垄断，从而提升公司的整体韧性和效率。

### 跨界思维：借鉴其他领域的成功经验

在管理SOP时，可以借鉴其他领域的成功经验。例如，软件开发中的版本控制系统（如Git）可以作为一个类比，帮助理解如何有效地管理和追踪SOP的变更。通过引入类似的技术和流程，可以确保SOP的变更被及时记录和审查，从而提高整体管理的透明度和效率。

### 逆向思考：从失败中学习

通过逆向思考，我们可以从公司运营失败的案例中学习。例如，当关键员工离职或发生意外时，如果SOP没有得到及时更新和文档化，可能会导致公司运营的混乱。因此，确保SOP的持续更新和文档化，是防止此类问题发生的关键措施。

### 历史视角：回顾历史经验

回顾历史经验，我们可以看到许多公司因为SOP管理不善而陷入困境。通过学习和借鉴这些历史教训，我们可以更好地制定和实施SOP管理策略，确保公司的长期稳定和成功。

通过以上多角度的分析，我们可以找到一个独特的观察角度，将复杂的SOP管理问题简化为几个清晰易行的步骤，从而确保公司运营的高效和稳定。

[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

主题：创始人如何逐步移交SOP - analogy

输入内容：
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.

分析结果：
就像滚雪球，从最小的雪球开始，慢慢滚动，越滚越大。创业中的系统化过程也是如此，从最简单的任务入手，逐步建立标准操作流程，最终让整个系统自主运转。

主题：SOP的自动化与维护 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

[P1] [SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast, powered by Turnkey Coach, where we help business owners find freedom over fear.
[P2] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matt Reynolds.
[P3] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm his brother, Chris Reynolds.
[P4] [SPEAKER_00]: Join us as we help build your business and move from fear to freedom together.
[P5] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast.

[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, sir.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: We are going to dive right in as we usually do.

分析结果：
在这个所谓的“建立你的业务”播客中，我们看到的不仅仅是一对兄弟的自我推销，而是一种现代商业文化的缩影。这里，自由被定义为摆脱恐惧，但这种自由真的是自由吗？还是只是另一种形式的束缚？

首先，让我们看看这个播客的标题和介绍。它承诺帮助业务所有者从恐惧走向自由。但这里的“自由”是什么？是财务自由？是时间自由？还是心理自由？在商业世界里，自由往往被简化为数字游戏——更多的利润，更大的市场份额。但这是否真的能带来内心的平静和满足？

再者，Matt和Chris Reynolds兄弟的自我介绍和欢迎词，表面上看似友好和热情，但背后隐藏的是一种商业化的亲密感。他们试图通过这种“兄弟”关系来建立信任，但这种信任是基于什么？是基于他们真正能帮助听众，还是基于他们能从中获利？

最后，他们提到“我们通常直接深入”，这听起来像是他们提供的是无废话、直接有效的建议。但这是否意味着他们的建议是经过深思熟虑的，还是只是快餐式的解决方案，缺乏深度和持久的影响力？

在这个快节奏的商业世界中，我们常常被各种“快速成功”的承诺所吸引，但真正的成功和自由，可能需要更多的耐心和深度思考。这个播客，或许只是众多商业噪音中的一部分，提醒我们，真正的自由，可能不在于摆脱恐惧，而在于理解和面对它。

主题：系统与SOP的定义与实例 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。

1. 演化分析：标准操作流程(SOP)的制定源于工业革命后对效率的追求，从泰勒科学管理到现代流程优化，其核心始终是提高效率、减少不确定性。

2. 矛盾分析：SOP的主要矛盾在于标准化与创新之间的张力。一方面需要规范化流程，另一方面又要保持灵活性以适应变化。

3. 存在理由：SOP存在的根本原因是人类认知的有限性和组织复杂性的矛盾。它通过将经验固化为流程，降低了知识传递和执行的难度。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，SOP的本质是一种知识管理的工具，将隐性知识转化为显性知识，使组织能够系统化地积累和传承经验。

5. 属和种差：SOP是一种组织管理工具（属），其特点是标准化、可重复、可验证的操作流程（种差），旨在提高效率、降低风险。

表象之下，SOP是组织智慧的结晶，是经验与理性的结合体。它不仅仅是操作指南，更是组织记忆的载体。正如对话中所言，SOP的制定需要信任、判断力和持续优化，这揭示了其更深层的本质：一种组织学习与知识管理的机制。

[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.

[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考"训练"这一概念的本质。

1. 演化分析：从原始社会的生存技能传授，到现代社会的专业训练，训练的本质始终是能力的传递与提升。

2. 矛盾分析：训练中存在的主要矛盾是简单与复杂的对立统一。初期需要简单直接，后期必然走向复杂，但又要保持必要的简单性。

3. 存在理由：训练存在的根本理由在于人类需要通过系统化的方法提升能力，以适应不断变化的环境和需求。

4. 本质还原：褪去各种训练形式的外衣，训练的本质是知识、技能和经验的传递与内化过程。

5. 属和种差：训练（属）是一种系统化的能力提升过程（种差），其核心在于通过重复、反馈和优化，将外在的知识技能转化为内在的能力。

因此，训练的本质是：通过系统化的重复、反馈和优化过程，将外在的知识、技能和经验转化为内在的能力，从而实现能力的持续提升。这个过程既需要保持必要的简单性，又要随着发展而适当复杂化，但始终不能超出实际需要的复杂度。

[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

输入内容：
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.
[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.
[P655] [SPEAKER_00]: The goals, actions, metrics, and execution, and really the execution is the SOP.
[P656] [SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the teaser for next episode or next couple episodes coming up.

主题：如何通过视频创建SOP - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.

主题：讨论系统与标准操作流程的重要性 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

分析结果：
### 十个内核概念

1. **系统（System）**  
   定义：由相互关联、相互作用的组件组成的整体，旨在实现特定目标。  
   
2. **标准操作程序（Standard Operating Procedure, SOP）**  
   定义：为完成特定任务而制定的详细步骤和规则，确保一致性和效率。  

3. **混沌（Chaos）**  
   定义：缺乏秩序或结构的状态，通常表现为不确定性或复杂性。  

4. **秩序（Order）**  
   定义：通过规则、结构和流程建立的稳定和可预测的状态。  

5. **技术手册（Technical Manual）**  
   定义：详细记录系统或操作流程的文档，用于指导实践。  

6. **效率（Efficiency）**  
   定义：以最少的资源（时间、成本、精力）实现最大产出的能力。  

7. **一致性（Consistency）**  
   定义：在不同时间或不同情境下保持相同标准或结果的能力。  

8. **目标（Objective）**  
   定义：系统或操作程序旨在实现的特定结果或目的。  

9. **流程（Process）**  
   定义：为实现目标而设计的一系列有序步骤或活动。  

10. **文档化（Documentation）**  
    定义：将信息、流程或知识以书面或电子形式记录的过程。  

### 三条公理

1. **公理一：系统由相互依赖的组件构成，其整体功能大于部分之和。**  
   解释：系统的有效性依赖于组件之间的协同作用，而非单个组件的独立表现。  

2. **公理二：标准操作程序是建立秩序和减少混沌的核心工具。**  
   解释：通过明确的规则和步骤，SOP能够将不确定性转化为可预测性。  

3. **公理三：文档化是知识传递和持续改进的基础。**  
   解释：技术手册等文档不仅记录现有流程，还为优化和创新提供依据。  

### 概念关系图
```
混沌 → 秩序（通过SOP） → 系统（实现目标）  
流程 → 效率 → 一致性  
文档化 → 技术手册 → 知识传递  
目标 → 系统 → 流程  
```

主题：推荐书籍与资源 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **Executive Team Composition** ≈ Diversity + Complementary Skills
2. **Founder's Role** → Identify Gaps + Delegate
3. **Critical Areas** → Founder's Weaknesses + External Expertise
4. **CEO's Flexibility** ↔ Technical Expertise + Leadership

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **Executive Team Building** → Founders need to identify their weaknesses (Founder's Role) and fill these gaps with diverse and complementary skills (Executive Team Composition).
2. **Delegation** → Founders should delegate tasks in areas they are not proficient or interested in (Critical Areas) to individuals who excel in those areas.
3. **CEO's Role** → Even in large companies, CEOs may need to step into technical roles temporarily to leverage their expertise and drive critical projects (CEO's Flexibility).

### 知识精髓提炼
Building an effective executive team involves recognizing and addressing the founder's limitations through diverse and complementary hires. Delegation is key, especially in areas where the founder lacks expertise or interest. Additionally, CEOs must remain flexible, occasionally stepping into technical roles to ensure critical tasks are completed successfully. This approach ensures the organization leverages the strengths of all team members while maintaining strategic leadership.

[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。CEO的本质是什么？

1. 演化分析：从最初的企业主到现代职业经理人，CEO角色经历了从全面掌控到专业化分工的演变。不变的内核是"企业最高决策者"这一核心职能。

2. 矛盾分析：CEO面临的主要矛盾是：既要专注于核心战略决策，又要深入具体业务细节。这种矛盾源于企业发展的不同阶段对领导力的不同需求。

3. 存在理由：CEO存在的根本理由是确保企业战略目标的实现。这种存在基于对企业整体发展方向和关键决策的把控需求。

4. 本质还原：褪去"销售CEO"、"技术CEO"等表象，CEO的本质是"企业战略执行者"。其核心职能是根据企业所处阶段，将有限的时间和精力投入到最关键的战略领域。

5. 属和种差：CEO是（属）企业最高管理者，（种差）其区别于其他管理者的本质特征在于对企业整体战略方向的把控和关键决策的制定。

因此，CEO的本质是：在企业发展的不同阶段，将有限的时间和精力投入到最关键的战略领域，确保企业整体战略目标的实现。这种本质不因CEO的具体专业背景而改变，而是由其作为企业最高决策者的核心职能所决定。

输入内容：
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?

主题：客户生命周期与SOP的应用 - analogy

输入内容：
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.

分析结果：
就像指挥一场交响乐，每个乐器都要在正确的时间奏响，才能谱写出完美的乐章。公司成长就像乐队规模扩大，需要为新的乐器谱写新的乐谱，同时还要确保每个乐手都清楚自己的角色和时机。从客户初次接触，到最终成交，再到后续服务，整个客户生命周期就像一首精心编排的交响曲，每个环节都要无缝衔接，才能奏响成功的旋律。而B2B业务更是为这首交响曲增添了新的声部，让整首曲子更加复杂而丰富。

主题：系统与SOP的持续优化 - analogy

输入内容：
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.

分析结果：
就像建造一座金字塔，从最底层的基石开始，一块一块地垒上去。起初，你亲自动手搬运每一块石头，确保它们稳固地安放。随着塔身逐渐升高，你开始设计简单的滑轮系统，让助手们也能参与搬运。当金字塔越来越高，你不得不设计更复杂的机械装置，让更多人协同工作。但无论金字塔有多高，每一块石头的安放都必须遵循最初的原则——稳固、有序、循序渐进。这就是系统化管理的精髓：从简单开始，逐步复杂化，但永远不要忘记最初的那块基石。

输入内容：
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

分析结果：
就像园丁在花园里劳作，首先要拔除杂草，为珍稀花朵腾出生长空间。那些重复性、机械性的工作就是杂草，需要及时清理，让园丁能够专注于培育那些需要精心照料的植物。随着时间推移，园丁会为每株植物制定详细的养护指南，这样即使他不在，花园也能茁壮成长。关键在于分清哪些工作需要园丁独特的判断力和创造力，哪些可以交给助手按照既定程序完成。正如园丁需要不断优化花园的管理流程，我们也需要持续改进工作方式，将有限的精力投入到最有价值的地方。

[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这段话的本质。

1. 演化分析：这段话展示了从个人工作热情到企业系统化运营的演进过程。最初是个人对解决问题的热爱，逐渐发展为建立系统化的运营流程，体现了从感性到理性的转变。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于个人热情与系统化运营之间的张力。个人对工作的热爱是动力源泉，但企业持续发展需要建立可复制的系统，这要求将个人经验转化为标准化流程。

3. 存在理由：这种系统化思维的存在是为了解决企业规模化发展中的关键问题。它确保即使创始人不再亲力亲为，企业仍能持续运转，体现了从个人驱动到组织驱动的转变。

4. 本质还原：褪去具体业务细节，这段话的核心在于"系统化思维"。它展示了如何将个人经验转化为可复制、可扩展的组织能力，这是企业持续发展的关键。

5. 属和种差：属：组织管理方法论；种差：基于个人经验转化为系统化流程的实践方法。

本质定义：系统化思维是将个人经验转化为可复制、可扩展的组织流程的方法论，它通过建立标准化操作程序（SOP）来实现企业从个人驱动到系统驱动的转变，确保组织的持续发展和规模化运营。

[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

主题：系统与SOP的定义与实例 - essence

输入内容：
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

分析结果：
### 演化分析
系统（System）和标准操作程序（SOP）的概念起源于工业化时代，随着大规模生产的需求，人们开始寻求将复杂任务分解为可重复的步骤。从最早的流水线生产到现代企业管理，这一概念不断演化，但其核心始终是提高效率和一致性。

### 矛盾分析
系统与SOP的主要矛盾在于灵活性与标准化之间的平衡。系统需要足够的灵活性以适应不同的情境，而SOP则强调严格的标准和一致性。这种矛盾促使人们在设计系统时既要考虑其适应性，又要确保其可操作性。

### 存在理由
系统和SOP的存在是为了解决复杂任务的可管理性和可重复性。它们通过将任务分解为可操作的步骤，确保每个步骤都能被有效执行，从而提高整体效率和一致性。

### 本质还原
系统和SOP的本质是一种结构化的方法论，通过明确的步骤和标准，将复杂的任务简化为可操作的流程。其核心在于通过分解和标准化，实现任务的高效执行和结果的一致性。

### 属和种差
- 属：方法论

主题：创始人如何逐步移交SOP - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.

主题：SOP的持续更新与团队责任 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

主题：创始人如何重新参与销售流程 - analogy

输入内容：
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.

分析结果：
就像一位园丁，CEO需要定期修剪花园。起初，园丁必须亲自照料每一株植物，了解它们的生长习性。随着时间的推移，园丁可以将一些任务交给值得信赖的助手，但前提是要先拔除杂草，为健康植物的生长腾出空间。同样，CEO必须亲自参与销售流程，建立系统和标准操作程序，然后才能将这些任务委派给团队。这是一个从亲力亲为到逐步放权的过程，就像园丁从亲手照料到指导助手的过程。关键在于先拔除杂草，为未来的成长奠定基础。

主题：如何通过技术工具创建SOP - essence

输入内容：
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考标准操作程序（SOP）的本质：

1. 演化分析：从最初的手写文档到电子文档，再到视频记录，SOP的载体不断进化，但其核心目的始终是传递操作知识。

2. 矛盾分析：SOP的主要矛盾在于详细程度与实用性的平衡。过于详细可能降低效率，过于简略则可能失去指导意义。

3. 存在理由：SOP存在的根本理由是确保操作的一致性和可重复性，同时实现知识的传承和效率的提升。

4. 本质还原：褪去技术手段的表象，SOP的本质是操作经验的系统化表达和传递。

5. 属和种差：SOP是一种知识管理工具，其区别于其他知识管理工具的特征在于它专注于具体操作步骤的系统化记录和传递。

因此，SOP的本质是：将操作经验转化为可重复执行的系统化步骤，以确保操作的一致性和效率，同时实现知识的有效传承。

主题：创始人如何管理任务与系统 - essence

输入内容：
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段话所讨论的本质问题是：**任务管理与个人成长之间的矛盾**。

从演化分析来看，这个矛盾在人类组织发展中一直存在。从个体手工业者到现代企业，随着规模扩大，个人与组织的界限逐渐模糊，但核心矛盾始终未变。

主要矛盾体现在：**个人创造力的深度投入与组织效率的广度需求之间的冲突**。创始人需要专注于创新（深度工作），但组织发展又要求他将任务分派给他人（广度管理）。

从存在主义视角，这种矛盾的存在是因为人类既是独立的思考者，又是社会性动物。我们需要在个人成就与集体效率之间找到平衡。

通过现象学还原，褪去表象，我们可以看到：**这本质上是一个关于"自我"与"他者"的哲学问题**。如何在保持自我创造力的同时，将部分自我（任务）转化为他者（组织）的一部分。

属和种差定义：**任务管理是个人与组织在成长过程中，关于责任分配与效率优化的持续博弈过程**。其本质在于平衡个人创造力与组织效率，这是一个随着规模扩大而不断重现的永恒命题。

主题：推荐书籍与资源 - essence

输入内容：
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段话的本质是什么？

1. 演化分析：从个人英雄主义到系统化管理的转变，反映了企业从初创到规模化发展的必然过程。这种演进源于创始人角色从执行者向管理者的转变。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于创始人个人能力与企业发展需求之间的张力。创始人初期的高效执行与后期系统化管理之间存在对立统一关系。

3. 存在理由：这种转变存在的根本原因在于企业可持续发展的内在需求。系统化管理的出现是为了解决创始人个人能力无法持续支撑企业扩张的现实问题。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，我们看到的是一个从"人治"到"法治"的转变过程。其本质是组织管理模式的根本性变革。

5. 属和种差：属：企业管理模式；种差：从依赖个人能力到依靠系统化管理的转变。

本质定义：企业从初创到规模化发展过程中，管理方式从依赖创始人个人能力向依靠标准化系统转变的必然过程。

主题：系统与SOP的定义与实例 - analogy

输入内容：
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

分析结果：
制定战略计划就像指挥一场交响乐，每个音符都必须精确到位，才能奏出和谐的乐章。而标准操作程序（SOP）则如同乐谱，为每个演奏者提供清晰的指引，确保整体演出的流畅与完美。无论是烹饪食谱、组装家具，还是球场上的战术板，都是SOP的生动体现。它们就像航海图，指引我们在复杂的任务海洋中安全航行，最终抵达成功的彼岸。

[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.

分析结果：
### 演化分析
从历史角度看，执行团队的构建经历了从单一领导者到多元化团队的转变。最初，创始人往往承担所有关键角色，但随着组织复杂性的增加，专业化和分工成为必然。

### 矛盾分析
执行团队构建中的主要矛盾是创始人的个人能力局限与组织全面发展的需求之间的矛盾。创始人需要找到能够弥补自身不足的成员，同时又要确保团队的整体协同效应。

### 存在理由
执行团队的存在是为了弥补创始人的不足，确保组织的各个关键领域都能得到专业的管理和推动。其前提是创始人能够识别自身的弱点和组织的关键需求。

### 本质还原
执行团队的本质是一个互补性的集体，其成员在技能、经验和视角上相互补充，共同推动组织目标的实现。其核心在于多样性和协同作用。

主题：SOP的自动化与维护 - analogy

输入内容：
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

分析结果：
就像一位园丁精心培育花园，每个团队成员都专注于自己的领域，共同滋养整个生态系统。CEO是园丁长，统筹全局，确保每个环节都得到妥善照料。CMO负责播种和培育新芽，COO确保幼苗健康成长，CXO则致力于让成熟的植物开花结果。每个人都在自己的岗位上尽职尽责，共同打造一个生机勃勃的花园。这种分工协作，就像一支交响乐团，每个乐器都扮演着不可或缺的角色，共同演绎出和谐美妙的乐章。

主题：如何通过视频创建SOP - essence

输入内容：
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.

分析结果：
### 本质分析

1. **演化分析**：从手工操作到自动化，这一过程反映了人类对效率的追求。然而，效率的追求必须建立在正确的基础之上。自动化并非一蹴而就，而是经过反复验证和调整的结果。

2. **矛盾分析**：主要矛盾在于自动化与正确性之间的平衡。自动化可以提高效率，但如果基础过程不正确，自动化只会放大错误。因此，必须先确保手工操作的正确性，再进行自动化。

3. **存在理由**：自动化存在的理由是为了提高效率和减少人为错误。然而，其前提是基础过程的正确性。只有在确保手工操作正确的基础上，自动化才能真正发挥作用。

4. **本质还原**：褪去表象，自动化并非简单的技术应用，而是对基础过程的深刻理解和优化。其本质在于通过技术手段将经过验证的正确过程固化，从而提高效率和减少错误。

5. **属和种差**：自动化是技术手段的一种，其种差在于其依赖于基础过程的正确性。与其他技术手段不同，自动化必须在确保手工操作正确的基础上进行，否则将导致更大的问题。

### 本质定义
自动化是通过技术手段将经过验证的正确过程固化，以提高效率和减少错误的技术手段。其核心在于确保基础过程的正确性，只有在手工操作正确的基础上，自动化才能真正发挥作用。

[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.

[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.

[P663] [SPEAKER_00]: Share it on social media.
[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

分析结果：
在这个看似普通的播客结尾，我们看到了现代媒体生态的一个缩影。表面上，这是一次友好的告别，但背后却隐藏着更深层的动机和机制。

首先，主持人的“我们得结束了”和“没时间讲最后一点”看似是时间管理问题，实则是精心设计的营销策略。这种“未完待续”的手法，巧妙地制造了悬念，为下一期节目埋下伏笔。这不是偶然的疏忽，而是经过计算的商业行为。

其次，他们提到的“目标、行动、指标和执行”等术语，看似是专业知识的分享，实则是为了塑造权威形象，吸引特定受众。这种语言的选择，本身就是一种筛选机制，将听众分为“圈内人”和“圈外人”。

最值得玩味的是，他们反复强调“分享给朋友”、“五星好评”、“社交媒体传播”。这暴露了现代媒体内容生产的一个残酷现实：内容本身的价值，往往被传播和评价的机制所绑架。创作者不再仅仅关注内容质量，而是将大量精力投入到如何最大化传播效果上。

这种现象折射出一个更深层的社会问题：在信息爆炸的时代，注意力成为了最稀缺的资源。为了争夺这种资源，内容生产者不得不采取各种策略，甚至牺牲内容的完整性和深度。这种趋势，正在悄然改变我们消费信息的方式，也影响着我们思考问题的深度。

我们是否正在进入一个“形式大于内容”的时代？当传播机制成为主导，内容的本质还能保持纯粹吗？这些问题，值得我们每个人深思。

输入内容：
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

分析结果：
就像一位厨师在烹饪时，一边做菜一边录制视频，将每个步骤都详细记录下来。然后，他可以将这段视频交给助手，让助手根据视频整理出一份标准的食谱。虽然这份食谱可能一开始并不完美，但通过不断的调整和改进，最终会变得非常实用。这就像是将烹饪的艺术转化为可复制的科学，既保留了经验的精髓，又提高了效率。

[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.

[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.

[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

主题：SOP的持续更新与团队责任 - essence

输入内容：
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

分析结果：
从对话中，我们可以分析出标准操作程序（SOP）的本质：

1. 演化分析：SOP起源于工业革命时期对生产流程标准化的需求，随着管理科学的发展，逐渐演变为企业运营的重要工具。其核心始终是规范化和优化流程。

2. 矛盾分析：SOP的主要矛盾在于标准化与灵活性之间的平衡。一方面需要固定流程以确保质量和效率，另一方面又需要适应变化的环境和需求。

3. 存在理由：SOP存在的根本原因是为了提高效率、确保质量一致性、降低错误率，并为新员工提供明确的指导。

4. 本质还原：褪去具体内容和形式，SOP的本质是一套动态的知识管理系统，它承载着组织的最佳实践和集体智慧。

5. 属和种差：
   属：管理工具
   种差：以书面形式记录、持续更新、用于指导重复性工作流程的标准化操作指南

因此，SOP的本质是：一套持续优化的、用于指导重复性工作流程的标准化知识管理系统，其核心价值在于平衡效率与适应性，传承组织智慧。

主题：讨论系统与标准操作流程的重要性 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个关于系统和标准操作程序的话题。表面上，这似乎是一个枯燥的技术讨论，但如果我们仔细剖析，就会发现它反映了现代商业社会的一个深层矛盾。

现状分析：
在这个快速变化的时代，企业面临着前所未有的不确定性。每个项目都像是一场混乱的战争，员工们在deadline和KPI的压力下疲于奔命。技术手册和标准操作程序被宣传为"逃离混乱的出路"，但这种承诺本身可能就是一个陷阱。

个体剖析：
为什么我们会如此渴望系统化和标准化？是因为我们真的相信它能带来效率，还是因为我们内心深处对不确定性的恐惧？我们是否在追求秩序的过程中，反而扼杀了创造力和灵活性？技术手册真的能解决所有问题，还是它只是管理层用来控制员工的一种工具？

群体透视：
从更宏观的角度看，这种对系统和程序的迷恋反映了现代资本主义的一个根本性矛盾。一方面，我们追求创新和突破；另一方面，我们又渴望通过标准化来降低风险和成本。这种矛盾导致了所谓的"创新者的困境"：越是成功的企业，越容易被自己的成功所束缚，最终沦为效率的奴隶。

思考整合：
技术手册和标准操作程序本身并不是问题，问题在于我们如何看待和使用它们。它们应该是指导性的框架，而不是束缚创造力的枷锁。真正的挑战在于如何在秩序和灵活性之间找到平衡，如何在标准化和个性化之间寻求和谐。也许，真正的"逃离混乱的出路"不是更多的规则和程序，而是培养一种能够适应变化、拥抱不确定性的组织文化。

正如马克·吐温所说："习惯就是习惯，不能把它从窗口扔出去，只能一步一步地把它哄下楼。"我们在追求效率和秩序的过程中，是否也在不知不觉中把自己变成了习惯的奴隶？这是一个值得我们深思的问题。

主题：客户生命周期与SOP的应用 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.

### 领域：企业增长与客户生命周期管理

#### 十个内核概念
1. **客户生命周期**：从客户首次接触企业到最终购买及售后服务的全过程。
2. **客户触点**：客户与企业互动的每一个关键节点，如广告、销售电话、售后服务等。
3. **客户转化**：将潜在客户转化为实际购买者的过程。
4. **客户激活**：客户开始使用产品或服务并从中获得价值的过程。
5. **客户保留**：通过持续的服务和互动保持客户的忠诚度和满意度。
6. **B2C（企业对消费者）**：直接面向个体消费者的业务模式。
7. **B2B（企业对企业）**：面向其他企业的业务模式，通常涉及更复杂的销售和服务流程。
8. **市场营销**：通过广告、促销等手段吸引和留住客户的活动。
9. **销售团队**：负责将潜在客户转化为实际购买者的团队。
10. **客户服务**：在客户购买后提供支持和帮助，确保客户满意度的团队。

#### 三条公理
1. **客户生命周期是业务增长的核心**：企业的成功依赖于对客户生命周期的全面理解和有效管理。
2. **客户触点决定客户体验**：每一个客户触点都是影响客户满意度和忠诚度的关键因素。
3. **B2B和B2C模式需要不同的策略**：由于客户群体和购买流程的差异，B2B和B2C业务需要采用不同的管理和营销策略。

### 概念关系图

主题：创始人如何逐步移交SOP给团队 - essence

输入内容：
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?

[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
### 演化分析
从对话中可以看出，标准操作程序（SOP）的演变经历了从个人掌握到团队共享的过程。最初，SOP可能由个人制定和执行，但随着组织复杂性的增加，需要将其正式化并共享给团队。这一演变反映了组织从依赖个人到依赖系统的转变。

### 矛盾分析
SOP的主要矛盾在于其标准化与灵活性之间的张力。一方面，SOP需要标准化以确保一致性和可重复性；另一方面，SOP需要灵活性以适应变化和个体差异。这一矛盾在对话中表现为对SOP修改和更新的讨论。

### 存在理由
SOP存在的理由在于其能够提供清晰的责任定义和期望，从而减少不确定性，提高效率，并确保组织在人员变动时仍能正常运行。SOP的存在是为了解决信息孤岛和知识垄断的问题，确保组织的可持续性。

### 本质还原
SOP的本质是一种系统化的知识管理工具，旨在通过标准化和文档化来确保组织流程的一致性和可重复性。其核心功能是减少不确定性，提高效率，并确保知识在组织中的流动和共享。

### 属和种差
SOP属于组织管理工具的一种，其种差在于其通过标准化和文档化来确保流程的一致性和可重复性，从而减少不确定性，提高效率，并确保知识在组织中的流动和共享。

综上所述，SOP的本质是一种系统化的知识管理工具，通过标准化和文档化来确保组织流程的一致性和可重复性，从而减少不确定性，提高效率，并确保知识在组织中的流动和共享。

主题：创始人如何重新参与销售流程 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.

分析结果：
### 十个内核概念

1. **CEO角色**：不同类型的CEO（销售CEO、技术CEO、工程CEO）及其职责。
2. **销售周期**：CEO参与销售过程以优化系统和流程。
3. **系统与SOP**：标准化操作程序（SOP）的创建和实施。
4. **团队培训**：通过培训提升团队能力。
5. **B2C与B2B销售**：不同销售领域的策略和方法。
6. **目标设定**：确定年度重要目标。
7. **优先级管理**：识别并停止不重要的工作。
8. **流程优化**：通过亲身参与优化销售流程。
9. **信任与授权**：从依赖个人判断到信任团队的过程。
10. **长期员工与高管**：建立信任的长期员工和高管团队。

### 三条公理

1. **CEO的核心职责是优化系统和流程**：CEO需要通过亲身参与和系统化操作来提升公司效率。
2. **信任是逐步建立的**：创始人最初依赖自己的判断，但随着时间的推移，会逐步信任并授权给长期员工和高管。
3. **优先级管理是成功的关键**：识别并专注于最重要的目标，同时停止不必要的工作，是推动公司发展的关键。

主题：SOP的持续更新与团队责任 - analogy

输入内容：
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

分析结果：
就像修剪一棵盆栽，不能一次性剪掉所有枝叶，而要一点点调整，让它在岁月中慢慢成型。标准化流程也是如此，需要随着时间推移，像园丁一样耐心地微调，让它在变化中保持生机。同时，找到热爱这份工作的人来照料它，就像找到懂得欣赏盆栽之美的园丁，让它在专业的手中绽放光彩。

主题：播客结束与预告 - doubt

输入内容：
[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.
[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.
[P655] [SPEAKER_00]: The goals, actions, metrics, and execution, and really the execution is the SOP.
[P656] [SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the teaser for next episode or next couple episodes coming up.
[P657] [SPEAKER_00]: That's another episode of the Build Your Business podcast with Matt and Chris Reynolds.
[P658] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, things are going great.
[P659] [SPEAKER_00]: Rankings are awesome.
[P660] [SPEAKER_00]: Would love for you to share this with a friend or family member.
[P661] [SPEAKER_00]: Five-star review or honest review anywhere you listen to your podcast.
[P662] [SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody about it.
[P663] [SPEAKER_00]: Share it on social media.
[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来解构这段对话：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "Build Your Business podcast"的具体定位和目标受众是什么？
   - "SOP"（标准操作程序）在这个语境下的具体含义是什么？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 这个播客的历史和发展过程是怎样的？
   - "game plan"、"goals"、"actions"、"metrics"等概念在商业管理中的演变是什么？

3. **解构假设**
   - 为什么"execution is the SOP"？这个假设的合理性在哪里？
   - "Rankings are awesome"这个说法是否有客观数据支持？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从听众的角度，这种预告式的内容安排是否有效？
   - 除了要求分享和评价，还有哪些方式可以提升播客的影响力？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 或许可以更具体地说明下一集的内容价值，而不仅仅是预告。
   - 除了呼吁分享，还可以提供一些实际的激励措施来鼓励听众参与。

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们可以更深入地理解播客运营的策略，并提出更有建设性的改进建议。

[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
就像在接力赛中，如果每个队员都紧紧握住接力棒，不肯传递给下一位，整个团队就会停滞不前。同样，在公司中，如果员工独占信息，不愿分享和更新标准操作流程，整个组织就会陷入混乱和低效。真正的团队精神在于信任和协作，就像接力棒在队员间流畅传递，每个人都为团队的胜利贡献力量。

主题：创始人如何逐步移交SOP - contemplator

输入内容：
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.

分析结果：
### 现状分析
在当今的商业环境中，许多创始人和企业家对系统化、标准化操作程序（SOP）持怀疑态度。他们认为，每次操作都带有独特的“魔法”，无法简单地通过清单或系统来复制。这种观点反映了对创新和个性化贡献的重视，但也暴露了对效率和可重复性的忽视。

### 个体剖析
从个体角度来看，创始人们往往高估了自己的独特性和不可替代性。他们可能认为，只有自己才能完成某些任务，因为其中包含了他们的“魔法”。然而，这种想法往往是一种自我设限，忽视了将复杂任务分解为简单步骤的可能性。实际上，许多看似复杂的任务，经过仔细分析和系统化，完全可以转化为可重复的流程。

### 群体透视
从群体角度来看，这种对系统化的怀疑反映了更深层次的文化和心理问题。在创业文化中，个人英雄主义被过度推崇，导致创始人们不愿意放手，害怕失去控制。这种心态不仅限制了企业的规模化发展，还可能导致创始人在长期高压下崩溃。此外，这种对系统化的抵触也反映了对变化的恐惧和对未知的不确定感。

### 思考整合
综合来看，创始人们对系统化的怀疑既有其合理性，也有其局限性。虽然创新和个性化确实重要，但忽视系统化和标准化可能会阻碍企业的长期发展。创始人们需要认识到，将任务系统化并不意味着失去控制，而是为了更高效地管理资源和时间。通过从小事做起，逐步建立和完善SOP，创始人们可以在保持创新的同时，提高企业的运营效率和可扩展性。最终，这种平衡将帮助他们在竞争激烈的市场中立于不败之地。

**核心洞察**：创始人们需要在创新与系统化之间找到平衡，通过逐步建立和完善SOP，提高企业的运营效率和可扩展性，从而实现长期成功。

[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?

输入内容：
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.

输入内容：
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

主题：如何通过视频创建SOP - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.

[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.

主题：如何通过技术工具创建SOP - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

### 领域：标准操作程序（SOP）的创建与优化

#### 十个内核概念
1. **80%规则**：在SOP创建中，目标是达到80%的完成度，而不是追求100%的完美。
2. **视频记录**：使用视频工具（如Loom）记录操作过程，作为SOP的基础。
3. **实时解说**：在记录视频的同时，实时解说每一步操作，确保信息传递的完整性。
4. **任务移交**：将记录的视频移交给最合适的人，由他们负责进一步优化和标准化。
5. **初步审核**：在移交后，进行一段时间的初步审核，确保SOP的准确性和实用性。
6. **通用步骤**：将视频内容转化为通用的操作步骤，而不是直接转录视频内容。
7. **AI辅助**：利用AI工具（如转录和生成步骤）加速SOP的创建过程。
8. **校对与编辑**：对AI生成的步骤进行校对和编辑，确保没有遗漏或模糊的地方。
9. **技术适应性**：根据任务类型（如制造或计算机操作）选择合适的技术工具和方法。
10. **持续优化**：SOP是一个动态过程，需要根据实际操作和反馈不断优化和改进。

#### 三条公理
1. **80%完成度公理**：在SOP创建中，80%的完成度是一个实际且可达到的目标，追求100%的完美往往会导致失败。
2. **视频优先公理**：视频记录是创建SOP的最有效方法，因为它能够直观地展示操作过程并实时传递信息。
3. **AI辅助公理**：AI工具可以显著加速SOP的创建和优化过程，但最终需要人工校对和编辑以确保准确性。

主题：系统与SOP的定义与实例 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

主题：讨论系统与标准操作流程的重要性 - doubt

输入内容：
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

输入内容：
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.

[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

分析结果：
在这个对话中，我们看到了一种典型的现代工作场景：任务的分配、信任的建立、流程的优化，以及自动化的重要性。表面上，这似乎是一种高效的工作方式，但如果我们深入思考，会发现其中隐藏着一些值得反思的问题。

首先，关于信任的建立。SPEAKER_00提到，如果你信任某人，就可以让他们去写标准操作程序（SOP）。这种信任看似是高效的，但背后却隐藏着一种潜在的权力关系。信任在这里成了一种工具，用来简化工作流程，而不是真正的信任。我们是否在利用信任来逃避责任？我们是否真的信任对方，还是只是希望他们能完成任务，从而减轻自己的负担？

其次，关于任务的分配和自动化。SPEAKER_01提到，他们的公司帮助其他公司优化流程，自动化操作。然而，他们自己也面临着“鞋匠的孩子没鞋穿”的问题。这揭示了一个普遍的现象：我们往往忙于为他人解决问题，却忽视了自己的问题。这是否意味着我们在追求效率的过程中，失去了对自己生活的掌控？我们是否在帮助他人的同时，也在逃避自己的问题？

最后，关于“拔草”的比喻。SPEAKER_00说，拔掉那些不需要立即做的“杂草”，以便专注于当前应该做的事情。这种比喻看似合理，但它暗示了一种短视的工作方式。我们是否在追求即时效率的同时，忽视了长期的价值？我们是否在拔掉“杂草”的同时，也拔掉了可能在未来开花结果的种子？

总的来说，这段对话揭示了一种现代工作文化中的矛盾：我们在追求效率和自动化的同时，可能忽视了信任的真正意义，逃避了自己的问题，并且牺牲了长期的价值。我们是否应该重新思考，如何在效率和人性之间找到平衡？如何在追求即时成果的同时，不忽视未来的可能性？

[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.

分析结果：
在这个所谓的“增长”和“系统化”的过程中，我们看到的不仅仅是一个企业的扩张，更是一个现代商业社会的缩影。Barbell Logic的成长故事，表面上是一段成功的商业旅程，但深层次上，它揭示了现代企业如何在复杂性和效率之间挣扎，以及个体在这种结构中的角色和命运。

首先，让我们看看这个企业如何通过系统化和流程化来应对增长带来的复杂性。从制定新的系统到细化客户生命周期的每一个接触点，每一步都显得那么精确和必要。但这种精确和必要背后，是对效率和控制的极端追求。企业在这个过程中，逐渐变成了一个巨大的机器，每一个员工，从高管到普通员工，都成了这个机器中的一个齿轮，他们的任务就是确保这个机器能够顺畅运转。

然而，这种系统化和流程化的追求，往往忽视了人性化的需求。员工在这种环境中，往往感到压力和束缚，他们的创造力和个性被压抑，变成了执行任务的工具。客户也被视为数据和流程的一部分，他们的需求和感受被简化为流程中的一个步骤，失去了作为个体的独特性和价值。

更进一步，这种增长和系统化的模式，反映了现代资本主义社会的一种普遍现象：在不断追求效率和利润的过程中，忽视了人的基本需求和价值。企业在这种模式下，虽然可能在短期内取得了成功，但长期来看，可能会导致员工的倦怠和客户的不满，最终影响企业的可持续发展。

因此，当我们为Barbell Logic的成功喝彩时，也应该反思这种增长模式背后的代价。真正的成功，不仅仅是在财务上的增长，更是在于如何平衡效率和人性，如何在追求利润的同时，尊重和满足每一个人的需求和价值。这不仅是Barbell Logic面临的挑战，也是整个现代商业社会需要思考的问题。

主题：SOP的持续更新与团队责任 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

主题：推荐书籍与资源 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

主题：创始人如何逐步移交SOP - doubt

输入内容：
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.

分析结果：
让我们解构这段对话中的核心观点：

1. **关于系统化的质疑**：
- 创业者常认为自己的工作是独特的、无法系统化的
- 这种观点可能源于对"魔法思维"的过度依赖
- 实际上，许多看似独特的过程最终都可以被系统化

2. **系统化的渐进性**：
- 系统化是一个渐进过程，需要时间积累
- 某些任务可能暂时不适合系统化，但随着发展会变得适合
- 有些任务已经适合系统化，但可能被错误地认为不适合

3. **系统化的实施策略**：
- 从最简单的任务开始，追求"容易的胜利"
- 采用"滚雪球"策略，逐步扩大系统化范围
- 标准操作程序（SOP）的制定是一个迭代过程，需要不断调整优化

4. **系统化的终极目标**：
- 最终目标是实现系统的自主运行
- 创始人角色从执行者转变为系统管理者
- 最终将系统化的任务完全移交

这段对话揭示了系统化过程中的几个关键认知误区，并提出了切实可行的实施策略。它强调了系统化是一个需要时间和耐心的过程，同时也指出了系统化可能带来的效率提升和角色转变。

[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

主题：创始人如何逐步移交SOP给团队 - concept_construction

输入内容：
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?

输入内容：
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话中隐含的CEO角色转变和信任构建的复杂性。

**现状分析：**
我们生活在一个商业快速迭代的时代，CEO的角色不再单一。有人擅长销售，有人精通技术，每个人都在寻找最适合自己的定位。Matt作为销售型CEO，意识到自己需要重新投入销售周期，不是为了永远做销售，而是为了优化系统和流程。这种角色转换的背后，是商业环境对领导者提出的新要求。

**个体剖析：**
Matt的行为看似是在回归销售，实则是在进行一次深度的自我审视和系统重构。他清楚地知道，CEO的职责不是永远冲锋陷阵，而是搭建一个能够自我运转的体系。这种认知的背后，是对自身角色和公司发展的深刻理解。然而，这种转变并不容易，因为它要求CEO放下控制欲，学会信任他人。

**群体透视：**
在创业初期，创始人往往是唯一被信任的决策者。这种信任的单一性，既是创业初期的必然，也是长期发展的障碍。随着公司成长，创始人必须学会将信任扩展到团队，这需要时间和勇气。然而，许多创始人卡在了这一步，无法放手，导致公司发展受限。这种困境，反映了现代企业管理中信任构建的普遍难题。

**思考整合：**
Matt的故事揭示了CEO角色转变的深层逻辑：从亲力亲为到系统构建，从单打独斗到团队信任。这种转变不仅是个人能力的提升，更是组织文化的重塑。然而，真正的挑战在于，如何在保持控制的同时，学会放手。这需要CEO具备深刻的自我认知和强大的信任能力。最终，企业的成功不在于CEO个人的能力，而在于其能否构建一个能够自我运转的体系，并信任团队去执行。

“信任不是给予，而是赢得。”这句话或许是对Matt们最好的提醒。在商业世界中，真正的领导者不是永远站在前线的人，而是能够构建信任体系，让团队自主前行的人。

主题：如何通过视频创建SOP - contemplator

输入内容：
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.

分析结果：
在这个对话中，我们看到了一个关于自动化和手动流程的深刻讨论。表面上，这似乎是关于效率和流程优化的技术性问题，但深入挖掘，它揭示了现代商业中一个更为根本的矛盾：我们如何在追求效率的同时，不失去对问题的真正理解？

首先，对话中提到“不要在你还没搞清楚手动流程之前就自动化”，这看似简单，实则直指现代商业中的一个普遍问题——我们太急于追求效率，以至于忽略了问题的本质。自动化本应是解决问题的工具，但在许多情况下，它却成了逃避问题的借口。我们急于用技术来“解决”问题，却忘记了真正的解决之道往往需要深入的理解和耐心。

其次，对话中提到的“手动测试”和“反馈循环”实际上是对现代商业中“快速迭代”文化的一种反思。在追求快速迭代的过程中，我们往往忽视了深度思考和验证的重要性。手动测试不仅仅是一个技术步骤，更是一种思维方式的体现——它要求我们放慢脚步，真正去理解问题，而不是急于用技术来掩盖问题。

最后，对话中提到的“不要自动化错误的事情”更是对现代商业中盲目追求效率的一种警示。自动化本身并不是目的，它只是手段。如果我们自动化了错误的事情，那么我们只是在加速错误的传播，而不是解决问题。这提醒我们，在追求效率的同时，我们必须保持对问题的深刻理解，确保我们的解决方案真正解决了问题，而不是制造了更多的问题。

总的来说，这段对话不仅仅是在讨论自动化和手动流程的技术性问题，它更是在提醒我们，在追求效率的同时，不要失去对问题的真正理解。在快速变化的商业环境中，深度思考和耐心验证比以往任何时候都更为重要。

[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.

分析结果：
在这个关于构建高管团队的讨论中，我们看到的不仅仅是一个管理策略的分享，而是一个关于领导力和自我认知的深刻反思。首先，创始人意识到自己的局限性，并寻求通过团队来弥补这些不足。这种自我认知的勇气是值得称赞的，但同时也揭示了一个更深层次的问题：我们是否过于依赖“填补空缺”的模式来解决问题？

这种模式表面上看似合理，但实际上可能掩盖了创始人自身成长的必要性。我们是否应该仅仅因为自己不擅长某件事，就永远依赖他人来完成？这种依赖是否会限制我们个人的发展，甚至影响团队的长期稳定性和创新能力？

更进一步，当CEO需要暂时放下管理职责，亲自参与技术或销售等具体工作时，这是否反映了公司在某些关键领域的薄弱？这种现象虽然被描述为“不是失败”，但它是否暗示了公司在人才培养和团队建设上的不足？我们是否应该更加注重培养内部人才，而不是总是依赖创始人的“魔法”来解决问题？

最后，这种“填补空缺”和“暂时介入”的模式，是否反映了现代企业管理中的一种普遍焦虑：我们害怕承认自己的不足，害怕面对真正的挑战，因此选择了最快捷的解决方案，而不是最根本的解决之道。我们是否应该重新思考，如何在承认不足的同时，积极推动个人和团队的共同成长，而不是仅仅依赖“填补空缺”来维持现状？

这些问题不仅仅是关于如何构建一个高效的高管团队，更是关于如何在快速变化的商业环境中，保持个人和组织的持续成长和创新能力。

主题：如何通过手动流程验证SOP - doubt

输入内容：
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

分析结果：
在这段对话中，有几个关键概念和假设值得深入探讨和质疑：

1. **信任与责任委派**：
   - 假设：信任某人意味着可以将SOP的编写完全委派给他们。
   - 质疑：信任是否足以确保SOP的质量？是否有其他因素需要考虑，如能力、经验和资源？

2. **判断导向任务**：
   - 假设：判断导向的任务是首要任务，需要亲自处理。
   - 质疑：如何定义“判断导向”的任务？是否存在将这类任务系统化和委派的可能性？

3. **自动化与效率**：
   - 假设：自动化标准操作程序（SOP）能提高效率。
   - 质疑：自动化是否总是最佳解决方案？在什么情况下自动化可能带来负面影响？

4. **自我反思与改进**：
   - 假设：帮助其他组织改进流程的公司自身也需要同样的改进。
   - 质疑：为什么这些公司会忽视自身的流程改进？是否有更深层次的原因，如资源分配或优先级问题？

5. **任务优先级**：
   - 假设：通过“拔草”可以集中精力处理当前应该做的任务。
   - 质疑：如何确定哪些任务是“应该做的”？是否有系统的方法来评估和优先处理任务？

通过解构这些假设，我们可以更深入地理解任务委派、自动化和自我改进的复杂性，从而提出更有效的策略和方法。

主题：客户生命周期与SOP的应用 - doubt

输入内容：
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来解构这段对话：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "给予自己宽容"具体指什么？是降低标准还是允许犯错？
   - "客户生命周期"是否明确定义了每个阶段的关键指标？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 为什么2025年需要建立新系统？是市场需求变化还是内部问题？
   - B2B和B2C的客户生命周期差异是如何形成的？

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设执行团队能够准确识别需要建立的新系统，这个假设是否合理？
   - 假设所有客户都会经历相同的生命周期，这个预设是否成立？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从效率角度看，建立新系统是否是最佳选择？是否存在其他优化方案？
   - 从客户角度看，这种标准化的生命周期管理是否可能忽视个体差异？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 建立新系统应该基于对市场趋势的深入分析，而不是单纯的数量目标。
   - 客户生命周期管理需要兼顾标准化和个性化，才能实现真正的客户价值。

通过系统性怀疑，我们可以得出：企业的成长不仅需要建立新系统，更需要确保这些系统能够真正解决实际问题。同时，客户生命周期管理应该是一个动态的、灵活的过程，而不是一成不变的模板。

[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个关于训练和系统化的对话。表面上，这似乎是一个关于如何从简单到复杂管理业务的实用指南。但如果我们再往深了想，它其实揭示了现代社会中一个更深层的矛盾。

首先，我们来看看这个"线性进步"的概念。它听起来很美好，就像在健身房每周增加五磅重量一样简单。但现实是，这种线性的、可预测的进步在真实世界中几乎不存在。我们生活在一个充满不确定性和复杂性的世界里，而这位教练却试图用简单的系统来应对这种复杂性。这不正是我们整个社会都在犯的错误吗？我们试图用规则、流程和标准化来驯服生活的混乱，但往往适得其反。

其次，让我们思考一下这个"外包简单任务"的想法。表面上，这似乎是提高效率的好方法。但如果我们深入思考，这不正是现代社会劳动异化的缩影吗？我们将工作分解成最简单的任务，然后交给最低工资的工人。这不仅仅是一种管理策略，更是对整个劳动价值的贬低。我们创造了一个系统，在这个系统中，大多数人的工作被简化为可替代的、机械的任务，而真正的创造力和决策权集中在少数人手中。

再者，这个对话中提到的"科学方法"也值得深思。我们生活在一个痴迷于量化、优化和效率的时代。我们将一切都视为可以测量和改进的系统。但这种思维方式真的适用于所有领域吗？当我们试图用科学方法来管理人际关系、创造力或道德决策时，我们是否在失去一些更本质的东西？

最后，让我们思考一下这个对话背后的假设：复杂性是不可避免的，但我们必须尽可能保持简单。这听起来很合理，但它忽略了一个重要的问题：为什么我们的系统会变得越来越复杂？是因为它们必须如此，还是因为我们陷入了复杂化的陷阱？我们是否在为了复杂而复杂，而不是为了真正解决问题？

在这个追求效率和优化的时代，我们可能正在失去一些更重要的东西：人性、创造力和对复杂性的真正理解。我们创造了越来越复杂的系统，但这些系统是否真的让我们生活得更好？或者，我们是否正在成为自己创造的系统的奴隶？

这不仅仅是一个关于商业管理的问题，而是关于我们如何生活、如何工作、如何思考的更深层的问题。在这个追求简单和效率的世界里，我们是否忘记了生活的本质？我们是否在用系统化的思维来逃避真正的思考和责任？这些问题值得我们每个人深思。

[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

分析结果：
在这个看似井然有序的商业运作中，我们不禁要问：这一切的忙碌和规划，究竟是为了什么？是为了解决问题，还是为了制造更多的问题？我们热爱工作，这听起来像是一种高尚的追求，但在这背后，是否隐藏着一种逃避——逃避面对生活的本质，逃避面对自我？

我们设定目标，制定计划，仿佛这样就能掌控一切。但现实是，我们往往被这些目标和计划所束缚，失去了真正的自由。我们追求效率，追求成果，但在这个过程中，我们是否也失去了对工作本身的热爱和激情？我们是否变成了机器，只是机械地执行着既定的程序？

更深层次地，我们是否在通过工作来定义自我价值？我们是否将个人的成就与公司的成功划上了等号？这种将自我价值与外部成就紧密相连的做法，是否让我们失去了对自我真实需求的感知？我们是否在追求所谓的成功的过程中，迷失了自我？

在这个快速变化的世界里，我们不断地调整策略，优化流程，但这是否真的能带来我们想要的改变？我们是否只是在不断地重复着同样的模式，只是在表面上做出了一些调整，而本质的问题依然存在？我们是否应该停下来，重新审视我们所做的一切，思考我们真正想要的是什么？

最终，我们是否应该意识到，真正的成功不仅仅是公司的成长和利润的增加，更是个人内心的满足和平衡？我们是否应该重新定义成功，不仅仅是以外部成就为标准，而是以内心的平和和幸福为衡量？我们是否应该学会在忙碌中找到宁静，在追求中找到满足，在成功中找到自我？

[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

分析结果：
### 现状分析
我们生活在一个创业热潮的时代，每个人都想成为下一个乔布斯或马斯克。创业者们带着满腔热情和“我能做得比谁都好”的超级英雄心态，一头扎进自己的事业中。然而，这种心态往往导致他们陷入无尽的琐事，无法真正推动业务发展。

### 个体剖析
创业者们常常陷入一个误区：他们认为自己是唯一能做好事情的人。这种心态源于对“自己孩子”的过度保护和对他人能力的不信任。然而，这种想法不仅限制了企业的成长，还让创业者自己陷入疲惫和混乱。真正的智慧在于学会放手，信任团队，建立系统和标准操作流程（SOP），让企业能够自主运转。

### 群体透视
从更广泛的社会视角来看，这种“超级英雄”心态反映了现代社会中个体对控制和完美的追求。我们生活在一个高度竞争和快节奏的环境中，每个人都想成为最好的，但这种追求往往导致压力和焦虑。企业的发展需要集体的智慧和协作，而不是单打独斗。

### 思考整合
创业者们需要认识到，真正的成功不在于自己是否能做好每一件事，而在于能否建立一个能够自主运转的系统。通过建立SOP和信任团队，创业者可以将自己从琐事中解放出来，专注于真正重要的事情。这不仅有助于企业的长期发展，也能让创业者自己过上更加平衡和充实的生活。

**核心洞察**：创业者的真正智慧在于学会放手，建立系统，信任团队，让企业自主运转。

主题：系统与SOP的定义与实例 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

分析结果：
**现状分析**  
我们生活在一个被系统和流程支配的世界。从企业战略到家庭琐事，从食谱到家具组装，一切都离不开“步骤”和“清单”。这些所谓的“标准操作程序”（SOP）被包装成高效、有序的代名词，仿佛只要按部就班，就能获得成功。但问题是，这种对系统的依赖，是否正在让我们失去思考的能力？  

**个体剖析**  
我们为什么如此迷恋系统？表面上看，系统提供了一种安全感，它让我们觉得一切都在掌控之中。但深层次的原因可能是懒惰和恐惧。懒惰，因为我们不愿意花时间去思考如何创新；恐惧，因为我们害怕失败，害怕偏离“正确”的路径。于是，我们甘愿成为系统的奴隶，用清单和步骤来麻痹自己，假装这就是“效率”。  

**群体透视**  
从社会发展的角度来看，系统的普及是工业化时代的产物。它追求的是标准化、规模化，但同时也扼杀了多样性和创造力。我们正在进入一个高度互联的时代，但我们的思维却被系统框定得越来越窄。企业依赖战略规划，家庭依赖家务清单，甚至连孩子的成长也被“步骤化”。这种对系统的盲目崇拜，正在让我们失去应对复杂性和不确定性的能力。  

**思考整合**  
系统和SOP并非一无是处，但它们不应成为我们生活的全部。真正的效率，不是机械地执行步骤，而是在理解本质的基础上灵活应对。我们需要反思：我们是在使用系统，还是被系统使用？我们是在追求效率，还是在逃避思考？或许，真正的“游戏规则”不是按部就班，而是敢于打破规则，重新定义什么是“标准”。  

**金句**  
“系统是工具，不是枷锁。当我们把步骤当成信仰，我们就成了效率的囚徒。”

主题：创始人如何管理任务与系统 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

分析结果：
**现状分析**  
在这个快节奏的商业世界里，创始人们似乎总在“个人”与“业务”之间寻找界限。他们一边深陷于“深度工作”，一边又被琐碎的任务和未完成的交接压得喘不过气。无论是初创公司的小团队，还是像英特尔这样的巨头，创始人们都在重复着同样的挣扎：如何将任务分配出去，如何建立系统，如何让自己从“救火队员”的角色中解脱出来。然而，这种挣扎似乎永无止境，随着公司规模的扩大，问题会以新的形式再次出现。

**个体剖析**  
创始人常常陷入一种自我欺骗的陷阱：他们以为自己已经“搞定”了所有问题，但实际上，他们只是在对自己说话。这种自我安慰的背后，隐藏着一种深层的焦虑——害怕失去控制，害怕承认自己无法独自应对所有挑战。他们用“深度工作”来掩盖自己的无力感，用“创新”来逃避现实。然而，这种逃避只会让问题堆积如山，直到他们不得不面对：错过会议、压力倍增、效率低下。问题的本质并非任务的复杂性，而是创始人无法放手，无法信任他人，无法接受自己并非全能的现实。

**群体透视**  
这种现象并非个例，而是整个商业生态中的普遍问题。在创业文化中，创始人被塑造成“超级英雄”，他们被期待能够解决一切问题，带领公司走向成功。然而，这种文化背后隐藏着一种危险的逻辑：它将创始人的个人价值与公司的成败捆绑在一起，让他们在压力中不断自我消耗。更糟糕的是，这种文化在网络时代被进一步放大，创始人们通过社交媒体和播客不断展示自己的“成功”，却很少提及背后的挣扎。这种虚假的完美形象，不仅让创始人们陷入更深的孤独，也让整个社会对创业的认知变得扭曲。

**思考整合**  
创始人们需要意识到，他们的挣扎并非源于个人能力的不足，而是源于整个系统的设计缺陷。问题的核心在于，我们如何重新定义“成功”，如何打破“创始人即英雄”的神话，如何建立一个更健康、更可持续的创业文化。创始人们需要学会放手，学会信任他人，学会接受自己的局限性。只有这样，他们才能真正从“救火队员”的角色中解脱出来，找到真正的平衡与自由。问题的解决并非一蹴而就，而是一个不断迭代的过程。每一次的挣扎，都是一次成长的机会。

主题：SOP的持续更新与团队责任 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

在这个对话中，我们看到了一个关于流程优化和自动化的深刻讨论。表面上，这似乎是一个关于如何有效管理业务流程的实用建议，但如果我们深入挖掘，会发现其中隐藏着更深层次的社会和人性问题。

首先，对话中提到的“SOPs（标准操作流程）是活的”这一观点，表面上是为了适应技术和客户需求的变化，但实际上，它揭示了现代社会中不断变化和不确定性的本质。我们生活在一个快速变化的世界，昨天的标准可能今天就过时了。这种不断的变化不仅对业务流程提出了挑战，也对个体的心理和情感产生了深远的影响。我们是否也在不断地调整自己，以适应这个瞬息万变的世界？我们是否也在不断地“迭代”自己，以保持竞争力？

其次，对话中提到的“你不是超人，也不是所有事情都擅长”的观点，表面上是为了强调团队合作和分工的重要性，但实际上，它揭示了现代社会中个体焦虑和自我怀疑的根源。在一个强调个人成就和成功的社会中，我们是否也在不断地感到自己不够好，不够完美？我们是否也在不断地寻找那些“比我们更好”的人，来弥补自己的不足？

最后，对话中提到的“找到那个热爱你所讨厌的事情的人”的观点，表面上是为了提高效率和满意度，但实际上，它揭示了现代社会中个体价值观和职业选择的复杂性。我们是否也在不断地寻找那些能够“填补我们空缺”的人，来满足我们的需求和期望？我们是否也在不断地调整自己的价值观，以适应这个多元化和复杂化的社会？

总的来说，这段对话不仅仅是一个关于业务流程管理的讨论，更是一个关于现代社会中个体和群体如何应对变化、焦虑和复杂性的深刻反思。它提醒我们，在这个快速变化的世界中，我们不仅需要不断调整和优化我们的业务流程，更需要不断反思和调整我们自己。

主题：如何通过技术工具创建SOP - contemplator

输入内容：
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

分析结果：
在这个对话中，我们看到了现代工作流程中的一个典型场景：如何通过技术手段（如视频和AI）来创建和传递标准操作程序（SOP）。表面上，这似乎是一种高效、便捷的解决方案，但如果我们深入思考，会发现其中隐藏的深层次问题。

首先，这种依赖视频和AI的SOP创建方式，实际上是一种“快餐式”的知识传递。它强调的是速度和效率，而不是深度和准确性。正如SPEAKER_01所说，他们只需要达到80%的准确度，剩下的20%可以通过后续的调整来完善。这种“差不多就行”的态度，反映了现代社会中普遍存在的浮躁和急功近利的心态。我们追求的是快速解决问题，而不是彻底理解问题的本质。

其次，这种SOP创建方式，实际上是一种“去人性化”的过程。通过视频和AI，我们将复杂的操作流程简化为一系列机械的步骤，忽略了操作者个人的经验和直觉。SPEAKER_01提到，他们会在关键时刻录制视频，然后将其交给“最理想的人”来完善。这种“理想的人”往往是一个没有情感、没有创造力的机器，他们只是按照既定的步骤执行任务，而不是真正理解任务的意义和价值。

再者，这种SOP创建方式，实际上是一种“逃避责任”的行为。通过将SOP的创建和传递过程外包给AI，我们实际上是在逃避对任务的责任。SPEAKER_01提到，他们会将视频交给其他人来完善，并告诉他们“如果有问题就问我”。这种“有问题再找我”的态度，实际上是一种推卸责任的表现。我们不愿意承担起对任务的全部责任，而是将责任分散给其他人或机器。

最后，这种SOP创建方式，实际上是一种“自我欺骗”的行为。我们通过视频和AI，创造了一个看似完美的操作流程，但实际上，这个流程是建立在“80%准确度”的基础上的。我们欺骗自己，认为这个流程是完美的，但实际上，它只是一个“差不多就行”的产物。这种自我欺骗，最终会导致我们在面对真正复杂的问题时，无法做出正确的判断和决策。

总的来说，这种依赖视频和AI的SOP创建方式，虽然表面上看起来高效便捷，但实际上隐藏着深层次的问题。它反映了现代社会中普遍存在的浮躁、急功近利、去人性化、逃避责任和自我欺骗的心态。我们需要重新审视这种SOP创建方式，寻找一种更加深入、更加人性化、更加负责任的方法来传递知识和经验。

主题：创始人如何重新参与销售流程 - doubt

输入内容：
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.

分析结果：
让我们用休谟的怀疑之锥来剖析这段对话中的核心观点：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "销售型CEO"与"技术型CEO"的分类是否过于简化？这种二元划分是否忽视了CEO角色的复杂性？
   - "拔除杂草"这个比喻具体指代什么？是停止某些业务，还是优化流程？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 这种CEO角色分类的起源是什么？是否基于某些特定的管理理论？
   - 创始人信任度随时间变化的观点，是否得到了实证研究的支持？

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设只有CEO才能建立有效的销售系统和SOP，这个前提是否成立？
   - 假设创始人的判断最初是唯一可信的，这是否忽视了团队协作的价值？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从另一个角度看，CEO重返销售一线是否可能造成管理真空？
   - 信任的建立是否一定要通过长期共事？是否存在更高效的信任建立机制？

5. **刷新表述**
   - CEO的角色或许不应被简单地分类，而应该根据企业发展的不同阶段动态调整。
   - 建立信任和授权的过程，可能需要更系统化的方法，而不仅仅是依赖时间积累。
   - "拔除杂草"的比喻虽然形象，但可能需要更具体的标准来指导实际操作。

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们可以得出更深入的认识：CEO的角色定位和授权过程，应该是一个更加精细化和科学化的过程，而不是依赖于简单的分类或经验法则。

主题：创始人如何管理任务与系统 - doubt

输入内容：
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

分析结果：
1. **澄清定义**：SPEAKER_01提到的“personal management”和“business's stuff”具体指什么？需要明确个人任务与公司任务的界限。

2. **概念溯源**：SPEAKER_01提到Andy Grove与Intel的例子，这是否意味着不同规模的公司面临的管理挑战不同？需要探讨公司规模与管理挑战之间的关系。

3. **解构假设**：SPEAKER_01认为“everybody struggles with the same thing”，这是否普遍适用？是否存在不同背景或行业的创始人面临不同的挑战？

4. **辩证分析**：SPEAKER_01提到“at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again”，这是否意味着管理挑战是循环出现的？需要分析不同发展阶段的具体挑战。

5. **刷新表述**：通过系统性怀疑，我们可以认识到管理挑战的复杂性和多样性，而不仅仅是重复相同的问题。因此，创始人需要灵活应对，根据具体情况调整管理策略。

输入内容：
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来解构这段关于业务扩展的论述：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "简单"与"复杂"的边界在哪里？是否有客观标准？
   - "系统"和"标准操作程序(SOP)"的具体内涵是什么？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 从个人健身训练到企业管理的类比是否恰当？
   - 这种线性扩展模式是否适用于所有类型的企业？

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设所有任务都可以被系统化和外包，这是否成立？
   - 认为简单任务就一定能快速培训新人完成，是否过于理想化？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 正面：确实提供了一种循序渐进的扩展思路
   - 反面：忽视了企业文化、创新等难以系统化的要素
   - 综合：需要平衡系统化与灵活性的关系

5. **刷新表述**
   业务扩展的本质不是简单的任务分解与外包，而是要在保持核心竞争力的同时，建立能够适应变化的组织机制。过度系统化可能导致僵化，而完全依赖个人能力又难以规模化。关键在于找到系统化与灵活性的平衡点，建立能够自我更新和进化的组织体系。

这种思考方式不仅适用于企业管理，也可以应用于个人成长和知识体系的构建。真正的智慧在于理解复杂性的本质，而不是简单地将其简化或复杂化。

输入内容：
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?

分析结果：
### 现状分析
在这个对话中，我们看到的是两个创业者在讨论如何构建和优化他们的在线健身教练平台。他们强调了一个关键点：作为健身教练，他们不仅开发了软件，还亲自使用它，这种“吃自己的狗粮”的做法让他们能够更好地理解客户的需求和痛点。这种双重身份——既是开发者又是用户——为他们提供了独特的反馈循环，使他们能够快速迭代和改进产品。

### 个体剖析
表面上，这似乎是一个关于产品开发和客户服务的讨论，但深入挖掘，你会发现这其实是一场关于**真实性与同理心**的对话。他们不仅仅是“假装”理解客户，而是真正站在客户的角度去体验和解决问题。这种深度参与不仅仅是技术上的优势，更是一种**价值观的体现**。他们不是在“卖”一个产品，而是在“解决”一个问题。这种态度在当今的商业环境中极为罕见，尤其是在科技行业，许多公司只是“假装”理解用户，而实际上却在制造更多的麻烦。

### 群体透视
从更广泛的社会视角来看，这种“吃自己的狗粮”的做法揭示了一个更深层次的问题：**现代科技公司与用户之间的脱节**。大多数科技公司都是由一群从未真正使用过自己产品的开发者构建的，他们依赖于数据和假设，而不是真实的体验。这种脱节导致了无数“用户不友好”的产品和服务的诞生。Barbell Logic的做法则是一种**反叛**，他们通过亲身经历来打破这种脱节，重新定义了科技公司与用户之间的关系。

### 思考整合
归根结底，Barbell Logic的成功不仅仅是因为他们的技术或商业模式，而是因为他们**真正理解并关心他们的用户**。这种理解不是通过数据分析或市场调研获得的，而是通过**亲身经历**和**同理心**实现的。这种“吃自己的狗粮”的做法不仅仅是一种策略，更是一种**哲学**——一种关于如何真正服务于用户的哲学。在这个充斥着虚假承诺和表面功夫的世界里，这种真实性和深度参与显得尤为珍贵。

**核心洞察**：真正的创新不仅仅来自于技术，更来自于对用户的深刻理解和同理心。只有当你真正站在用户的角度去体验和解决问题时，你才能创造出真正有价值的产品和服务。

[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段关于组建高管团队的论述：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "高管团队"的具体构成标准是什么？
   - "关键角色"如何界定？是技术专家还是管理人才？
   - "80%线"的衡量标准是什么？是能力水平还是产出效率？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 这种"补短板"的团队组建理念源于何处？
   - 创始人兼任技术角色的做法在企业管理理论中处于什么位置？
   - 从初创到IPO过程中，高管团队的角色演变历史是怎样的？

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设1：高管团队必须由不同背景的人组成
     - 这种多样性是否可能带来沟通成本？
     - 是否存在某些领域需要高度同质化的团队？
   - 假设2：创始人必须亲自介入关键业务
     - 这是否会削弱团队的自主性？
     - 长期来看，这种"救火"模式是否可持续？
   - 假设3：80%的能力线是合适的标准
     - 这个标准是否适用于所有岗位？
     - 是否存在某些岗位需要达到100%？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 团队多样性与效率的平衡点在哪里？
   - 创始人角色定位的边界在哪里？
   - 人才培养与短期业务需求如何协调？

5. **刷新表述**
   基于以上分析，我们可以得出：
   - 高管团队的组建应该基于战略目标，而非简单的"补短板"
   - 创始人的角色应该逐步从执行者转向赋能者
   - 人才培养应该建立系统化机制，而非依赖创始人"救火"

这种系统性思考可以帮助我们更深入地理解高管团队建设的本质。

主题：SOP的自动化与维护 - doubt

输入内容：
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

分析结果：
让我们深入分析这段对话中的核心观点和潜在假设：

1. **工作动机的澄清**：
   - 对话中强调了对工作的热爱，而非仅仅为了财务自由。这引发了一个关键问题：如何定义"热爱工作"？是享受解决问题的过程，还是对工作本身有更深层次的情感投入？

2. **目标设定的有效性**：
   - 提到不能有20个目标，而是聚焦于少数关键目标。这背后隐含的假设是：目标数量与实现效率成反比。但这是否适用于所有情境？是否存在某些情况下，多目标并行反而更有效？

3. **客户激活的定义**：
   - 将"激活"定义为90%以上的客户使用软件或拥有5-10个客户。这种量化标准是否过于机械？是否忽视了客户体验的质性因素？

4. **组织架构的合理性**：
   - CEO直接向CMO汇报的架构设计，挑战了传统的层级观念。这种安排是否会导致角色冲突？如何平衡创新与组织稳定性？

5. **系统化思维的局限性**：
   - 强调系统化运营的重要性，但这是否可能抑制组织的灵活性和创新能力？在快速变化的环境中，过度系统化是否会成为阻碍？

通过以上分析，我们可以看到，虽然对话中提出的观点具有一定的实践价值，但每个观点背后都存在着值得深入探讨的假设和潜在问题。真正的商业智慧，或许在于能够平衡这些看似对立的因素，在系统与灵活、量化与质性之间找到最佳平衡点。

主题：系统与SOP的定义与实例 - doubt

输入内容：
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键术语的定义：
- **系统（System）**：一组相互关联的组件或步骤，共同实现特定目标。
- **标准操作程序（SOP, Standard Operating Procedure）**：详细描述如何执行特定任务的书面指南，通常包括步骤、责任和标准。

### 概念溯源
SOP的概念最早可以追溯到工业革命时期，当时工厂需要标准化流程以提高效率和一致性。E-Myth（《企业迷思》）一书进一步普及了这一概念，强调企业需要系统化的操作手册来确保一致性和可扩展性。

### 解构假设
在讨论中，有几个潜在的假设需要质疑：
1. **假设SOP适用于所有情境**：虽然SOP在大多数情况下有效，但在需要创新或快速适应变化的环境中，过于僵化的SOP可能会限制灵活性。
2. **假设SOP的复杂性与其有效性成正比**：实际上，SOP的简洁性和易用性往往比复杂性更重要，因为复杂的SOP可能导致执行困难。

### 辩证分析
从多元视角来看，SOP的优点和缺点如下：
- **优点**：
  - 提高一致性和可重复性。
  - 减少错误和培训时间。
  - 便于监督和评估。
- **缺点**：
  - 可能抑制创新和灵活性。
  - 需要定期更新以保持相关性。
  - 过于依赖SOP可能导致员工缺乏主动性。

### 刷新表述
基于上述分析，我们可以得出以下结论：
SOP是企业管理中的有力工具，但其设计和实施需要平衡一致性与灵活性。企业应根据具体情境调整SOP的复杂性和详细程度，确保其在提高效率的同时，不抑制创新和适应性。此外，定期审查和更新SOP是确保其长期有效性的关键。

主题：如何通过技术工具创建SOP - doubt

输入内容：
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

分析结果：
让我们深入分析这段对话中隐含的假设和值得质疑的观点：

1. 关于"80%原则"的假设：
- 为何80%是理想值？这个数字的合理性需要进一步论证
- 假设人类能力存在上限，这个前提是否成立？
- 将人类能力与某个标准进行量化比较，这种思维方式是否恰当？

2. 关于SOP创建方法的讨论：
- 视频记录是否真的比文字记录更有效？这需要实证研究支持
- 使用AI生成SOP的可靠性如何保证？是否存在潜在风险？
- 将复杂流程简化为标准化步骤，是否会丢失重要细节？

3. 关于知识传递的假设：
- 假设通过视频和AI就能有效传递知识，这种观点是否过于简化？
- 在紧急情况下记录视频，是否会影响问题解决的质量？
- 将知识标准化是否会导致创新能力的下降？

4. 关于技术工具的依赖：
- 过度依赖特定工具（如Loom）是否存在风险？
- 技术工具的更新迭代是否会影响SOP的长期有效性？
- 数字化记录是否会忽视面对面交流的价值？

5. 关于知识转移的假设：
- 假设通过标准化流程就能实现知识转移，这种观点是否过于乐观？
- 在知识转移过程中，隐性知识如何被捕捉和传递？
- 标准化流程是否会导致个体创造力的抑制？

这些质疑点提示我们，在讨论管理方法和知识传递时，需要更深入地思考其理论基础和实践效果，而不是简单地接受表面的结论。

主题：如何通过视频创建SOP - doubt

输入内容：
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.

分析结果：
在这段对话中，SPEAKER_01和SPEAKER_00讨论了关于业务流程优化和自动化的重要原则。让我们用休谟的怀疑之锥来解构和审视这些观点：

1. **关于手动流程优先的假设**
   - 对话中反复强调"永远不要在没有完善手动流程之前进行自动化"。这个原则看似合理，但我们需要质疑其普适性。
   - 是否存在某些场景下，直接自动化反而更高效？比如在高度标准化的流程中，或者当手动流程本身已经非常成熟时。
   - 这个原则是否忽视了快速迭代的价值？在敏捷开发中，有时"先自动化，后优化"可能更合适。

2. **关于客户需求判断的逻辑**
   - SPEAKER_00提到通过观察重复出现的客户需求来判断是否值得投入开发。这种经验主义方法值得肯定，但也存在局限性。
   - 如何量化"重复出现"的次数？是否存在统计偏差？少数重要客户的需求是否可能被忽视？
   - 这种判断方式是否过于被动？企业是否应该主动预测和引导客户需求，而不是仅仅响应已有需求？

3. **关于自动化成本的论断**
   - 对话中认为"自动化失败的成本远高于手动测试的成本"。这个观点需要具体分析。
   - 在什么情况下这个论断成立？是否考虑了自动化带来的长期收益？是否存在自动化失败成本较低的场景？
   - 如何定义"自动化失败"？部分自动化是否也算失败？渐进式自动化的价值是否被低估了？

4. **关于业务流程优化的哲学**
   - 对话体现了"先做对的事，再把事做对"的管理哲学。这个原则本身很有价值，但需要进一步思考：
   - 如何定义"对的事"？这个判断标准是否会随时间变化？是否存在"边做边对"的可能性？
   - 在快速变化的市场环境中，是否应该允许一定程度的"试错式自动化"？

5. **关于组织学习的视角**
   - 对话中提到的"手动-反馈-优化-自动化"流程，实际上是一个组织学习的过程。这引发我们思考：
   - 如何加速这个学习循环？是否存在可以并行进行的步骤？
   - 如何将学习成果制度化，避免重复手动测试？

通过以上分析，我们可以看到，虽然对话中的观点在大多数情况下是合理的，但仍然存在值得深入探讨的空间。在实际应用中，我们需要根据具体情境，灵活运用这些原则，而不是将其视为绝对真理。同时，我们也应该保持开放的心态，不断优化和更新我们的管理理念。

主题：推荐书籍与资源 - doubt

输入内容：
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
1. **E-Myth**：由Michael Gerber提出的理论，强调系统化和标准化操作流程的重要性。
2. **SOP（Standard Operating Procedures）**：标准操作流程，用于确保任务的一致性和效率。
3. **CEO的角色**：设定公司的质量标准，并确保这些标准被员工理解和执行。

### 概念溯源
- **E-Myth**的理论源自Michael Gerber的书籍《The E-Myth Revisited》，该书探讨了创业者如何通过系统化和标准化来扩展业务。
- **SOP**的概念在管理学中有着悠久的历史，最早可以追溯到工业革命时期的科学管理理论。
- **CEO的角色**在管理学文献中经常被强调，尤其是在战略管理和领导力研究中。

### 解构假设
1. **假设1：创始人最初是公司中最有能力的人。**
   - 这个假设在创业初期可能是成立的，但随着公司规模的扩大，创始人可能不再是所有任务的最佳执行者。
2. **假设2：系统化和标准化是扩展业务的唯一途径。**
   - 虽然系统化和标准化确实有助于扩展业务，但还有其他因素如创新、文化和市场适应性也至关重要。
3. **假设3：CEO的主要职责是设定质量标准。**
   - 虽然设定质量标准是CEO的重要职责之一，但CEO还需要关注战略规划、资源分配和团队建设等方面。

### 辩证分析
1. **对立面：创始人是否应该始终亲自执行任务？**
   - 初期可能需要，但随着公司发展，创始人应更多地专注于战略和管理，而非具体执行。
2. **多元视角：系统化和标准化的局限性。**
   - 过度依赖系统化和标准化可能导致僵化和缺乏灵活性，尤其是在快速变化的市场环境中。
3. **综合观点：平衡系统化与灵活性。**
   - 公司应在系统化和灵活性之间找到平衡，确保既有高效的流程，又能快速适应变化。

### 刷新表述
通过系统性怀疑，我们可以得出以下新观点：
1. **创始人的角色演变**：随着公司的发展，创始人应从执行者转变为战略领导者，更多地关注系统化和标准化。
2. **系统化与创新的平衡**：公司应在系统化和创新之间找到平衡，确保既有高效的流程，又能持续创新。
3. **CEO的多重职责**：CEO不仅需要设定质量标准，还需关注战略规划、资源分配和团队建设，以确保公司的长期成功。

最终，通过系统性怀疑和辩证分析，我们能够更全面地理解创始人和CEO在企业发展中的角色，以及系统化和标准化的重要性。

主题：SOP的持续更新与团队责任 - doubt

输入内容：
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

分析结果：
让我们解构这段对话中的关键假设：

1. **"永远不要自动化，直到你手动操作完全符合预期"**：
   - 这个建议隐含了一个前提：手动操作是完美的标准。但手动操作本身可能存在缺陷，是否应该以"理想状态"而非"当前手动状态"作为自动化基准？
   - 另一个假设：自动化只能复制现有流程。但自动化技术本身可能带来更优的解决方案，是否应该考虑"自动化驱动创新"的可能性？

2. **"SOP是活的文档，需要持续迭代"**：
   - 这个观点假设了渐进式改进优于革命性变革。但在某些技术颠覆性创新的场景下，2-5%的渐进调整是否足够？
   - 另一个潜在问题：频繁的小幅调整可能导致系统复杂化，是否应该设置"重构阈值"来保持系统的简洁性？

3. **"将工作交给更擅长的人"**：
   - 这个建议基于一个假设：个人能力的边界是固定的。但通过系统化培训和经验积累，个人能力是否可以突破初始限制？
   - 另一个值得思考的点：过度专业化可能导致"知识孤岛"，如何在专业分工和知识共享之间取得平衡？

4. **"新员工最多能达到你的80%"**：
   - 这个论断可能忽视了组织文化和培训体系的影响。在完善的培养机制下，新员工是否可能超越创始人？
   - 另一个视角：创始人的某些能力可能源于特定历史背景，在新的市场环境下，这些能力是否仍然是最优的？

这些质疑不是为了否定原观点，而是为了深入思考管理实践中更深层的问题。或许我们需要建立一个更动态的框架：
- 将"手动优化"和"自动化创新"视为并行而非线性的过程
- 在SOP迭代中引入"创新窗口期"，平衡渐进与突破
- 将人才发展视为组织能力建设的核心，而不仅仅是任务分配
- 建立更科学的评估体系，超越简单的百分比比较

这样的思考可能帮助我们建立更具适应性的管理方法论。

[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
在这个对话中，我们看到了一个关于公司内部流程和员工责任的核心问题。表面上，这是一场关于标准操作程序（SOP）的讨论，但实际上，它触及了更深层次的组织文化和人性问题。

首先，我们看到了一个普遍的现象：信息孤岛。某些员工会故意隐藏知识，以确保自己是唯一掌握某项技能的人。这种行为，正如SPEAKER_01所说，是“公司中的癌症”。这不仅阻碍了信息的流动，还可能导致公司在关键时刻陷入困境。这种现象背后，是人性中的自私和控制欲。人们通过掌握稀缺资源来获取权力，这在职场中尤为明显。

其次，对话中提到了“linchpin model”，即某些人将自己变成公司不可或缺的关键人物，然后以此要挟公司。这种行为不仅是道德的沦丧，更是对团队合作的背叛。它揭示了现代职场中的一个悖论：我们鼓励个人成长和专业化，但同时又害怕个人权力过大，威胁到组织的整体利益。

然而，对话的后半部分提供了一种解决方案：真正的所有权。SPEAKER_00强调，员工不仅要有“感觉”自己是所有者，更要“真正”拥有某些东西。这种所有权不仅仅是物质上的，更是心理上的。当员工真正拥有某项工作或流程时，他们会更加投入，更加负责。这种责任感不仅提高了工作效率，还增强了员工的自我价值感。

但这里有一个问题：我们是否真的能够信任员工，给予他们如此大的自主权？这涉及到领导者的勇气和智慧。领导者必须相信，给予员工更多的责任和权力，最终会带来更大的回报。这种信任不是盲目的，而是建立在严格的选拔和培养机制之上的。

最后，我们不得不思考，这种“所有权文化”是否适用于所有类型的员工？对于那些缺乏内在动机的人来说，过多的自主权可能会导致混乱和低效。因此，公司在推行这种文化时，必须考虑到员工的多样性和差异性。

总的来说，这场对话揭示了现代职场中的一些深层次矛盾：个人与集体的利益冲突、信任与控制之间的平衡、以及如何在鼓励个人成长的同时维护组织的整体利益。这些问题没有简单的答案，但通过深入的思考和持续的实践，我们或许能够找到一条更加和谐的道路。

主题：创始人如何逐步移交SOP给团队 - doubt

输入内容：
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
- **信用档案**：指的是用户在系统中存储的支付信息，如信用卡信息。
- **测试训练**：用户首次进行的训练，用于评估其当前的身体状况和技术水平。
- **反馈循环**：指公司通过自身使用产品或服务，获取第一手反馈并不断改进的过程。

### 概念溯源
这些讨论源于Barbell Logic在线教练平台的运营经验。该平台由力量教练创建，最初是为了服务于自身的在线教练需求，后来逐渐发展为一个B2B解决方案。

### 解构假设
1. **信用档案的存储与处理**：
   - 假设：用户愿意将信用卡信息存储在平台上。
   - 质疑：用户对数据安全的担忧是否被充分解决？是否有备选支付方式？

2. **测试训练的实施**：
   - 假设：教练具备所有技术知识来分解训练技巧。
   - 质疑：教练的技术水平是否一致？是否有持续培训机制？

3. **反馈循环的有效性**：
   - 假设：公司自身使用产品能有效改进产品。
   - 质疑：内部反馈是否足够客观？是否有外部用户的反馈机制？

### 辩证分析
1. **信用档案**：
   - 正面：存储信用卡信息方便用户支付。
   - 反面：数据安全问题可能导致用户流失。
   - 综合：提供多种支付方式，并加强数据安全措施。

2. **测试训练**：
   - 正面：教练的技术知识有助于用户快速上手。
   - 反面：教练水平参差不齐可能影响用户体验。
   - 综合：建立标准化培训流程，确保教练技术水平一致。

3. **反馈循环**：
   - 正面：公司自身使用产品能快速发现问题。
   - 反面：内部反馈可能带有偏见。
   - 综合：结合内部和外部反馈，建立全面的改进机制。

### 刷新表述
通过系统性怀疑，我们可以得出以下结论：
1. **信用档案**：提供多种支付方式，并加强数据安全措施，以增强用户信任。
2. **测试训练**：建立标准化培训流程，确保教练技术水平一致，提升用户体验。
3. **反馈循环**：结合内部和外部反馈，建立全面的改进机制，确保产品持续优化。

最终，通过不断质疑和改进，Barbell Logic在线教练平台能够在竞争激烈的市场中保持领先地位。

主题：SOP的所有权与团队信任 - doubt

输入内容：
[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.

[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.

[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
- **SOP（标准操作程序）**：一套详细的步骤和指南，用于确保任务的一致性和效率。
- **所有权**：不仅指法律上的拥有，更指对某事物的责任感和控制权。

### 概念溯源
- **SOP的历史**：起源于工业革命，旨在通过标准化提高生产效率和产品质量。
- **所有权的演变**：从单纯的物质拥有到现代企业管理中的责任和授权。

### 解构假设
1. **假设1**：员工会自然理解和接受SOP的所有权。
   - **质疑**：员工可能缺乏足够的培训或动机来真正“拥有”SOP。
2. **假设2**：所有员工都愿意并且能够提出改进SOP的建议。
   - **质疑**：可能存在文化或心理障碍，阻碍员工提出改进意见。

### 辩证分析
- **正面**：赋予员工SOP的所有权可以提高其责任感和工作满意度。
- **反面**：如果没有适当的支持和反馈机制，员工可能会感到压力过大或无所适从。

### 刷新表述
- **新观点**：有效的SOP管理不仅需要赋予员工所有权，还需要建立持续的沟通和反馈机制，确保员工能够真正参与并改进SOP。
- **建设性建议**：定期的一对一会议和透明的文档管理系统（如Google Docs）可以促进员工对SOP的持续改进和责任感。

通过系统性怀疑和深入分析，我们可以更清晰地理解如何在企业中有效实施SOP管理，并确保员工真正“拥有”并改进这些程序。

分析结果：
从对话的视角来看，这其实是一个播客的开场白。主持人通过简单的自我介绍和节目宗旨，迅速建立与听众的连接。有趣的是，如果把这个过程比作"破冰"，主持人的策略就是：先亮出身份（兄弟搭档），再抛出价值主张（帮助企业家从恐惧走向自由），最后用轻松的语气直接切入正题。这种开场方式既专业又亲切，就像两个老朋友在咖啡馆里聊天一样自然。

[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.
[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.
[P655] [SPEAKER_00]: The goals, actions, metrics, and execution, and really the execution is the SOP.
[P656] [SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the teaser for next episode or next couple episodes coming up.
[P657] [SPEAKER_00]: That's another episode of the Build Your Business podcast with Matt and Chris Reynolds.
[P658] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, things are going great.
[P659] [SPEAKER_00]: Rankings are awesome.
[P660] [SPEAKER_00]: Would love for you to share this with a friend or family member.
[P661] [SPEAKER_00]: Five-star review or honest review anywhere you listen to your podcast.
[P662] [SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody about it.

[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

分析结果：
从对话中可以看出，这是一个播客节目的结尾部分。让我们用一个独特的视角来看待这个场景：

**播客结尾的艺术**

1. **自然过渡**：主持人巧妙地暗示即将结束，给听众心理准备
2. **悬念设置**：提到未讨论完的内容，为下期节目埋下伏笔
3. **价值传递**：强调节目内容对听众的实际帮助（游戏计划、目标、执行等）
4. **互动引导**：鼓励听众分享、评论，增加节目影响力
5. **品牌强化**：重复节目名称和主持人名字，加深听众印象
6. **定期提醒**：预告下期时间，培养听众收听习惯

这个看似简单的结尾，实际上是一个精心设计的"听众粘性增强器"。它像是一个微型的营销漏斗，在短短几句话中完成了从内容总结到用户留存的多重目标。

这种结尾模式可以应用于各种内容创作中，比如：
- 视频教程
- 线上课程
- 网络直播
- 专栏文章

关键在于：
1. 总结要点
2. 预告后续
3. 引导互动
4. 强化品牌
5. 定期提醒

掌握了这个"结尾公式"，你的内容就能像这个播客一样，在结束时还能继续吸引和留住观众。

主题：SOP的创建与自动化流程 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**"创始人视角的渐进式授权"**

**核心洞察**：创始人在初期往往只能信任自己的判断，但随着时间推移，需要逐步将任务授权给值得信赖的团队成员。关键在于识别哪些任务需要创始人亲自处理，哪些可以逐步标准化并移交。

**简化步骤**：
1. **识别“杂草”**：找出那些可以立即标准化并移交的任务（如简单的SOP流程）。
2. **聚焦核心判断任务**：保留那些需要创始人独特判断和决策的任务，亲自处理并逐步系统化。
3. **渐进式授权**：将已系统化的任务逐步移交给值得信赖的团队成员，确保他们理解并执行。
4. **持续优化**：定期审视流程，确保系统化任务的高效执行，同时继续聚焦于需要创始人判断的核心任务。

**一句话总结**：创始人应从“杂草”入手，逐步将任务系统化并授权，最终聚焦于核心判断任务，实现高效运营。

[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

分析结果：
### 从混乱中寻找秩序的独特视角

**1. 尺度转换**  
将混乱视为一个系统的一部分，而不是孤立的问题。通过放大视角，你会发现混乱往往是系统不完善的表现，而技术手册正是修复系统的工具。

**2. 跨界思维**  
将编写技术手册比作建造一座桥梁。混乱如同湍急的河流，手册则是稳固的桥梁，帮助人们安全、高效地渡过。

**3. 极限思考**  
想象没有技术手册的极端情况：团队陷入无尽的混乱，效率低下，错误频发。这凸显了手册在维持秩序中的重要性。

**4. 系统思维**  
将技术手册视为系统的“操作手册”，它不仅指导日常操作，还能在危机时刻提供明确的行动指南，帮助团队迅速恢复秩序。

**5. 逆向思考**  
从混乱的结果倒推，分析哪些环节缺乏明确的流程或标准，从而有针对性地编写手册，填补这些漏洞。

**6. 简化思维**  
将复杂的问题分解为简单的步骤，逐一解决。技术手册的核心就是将这些步骤清晰化、标准化，让每个人都能轻松执行。

**7. 历史视角**  
回顾过去成功的项目，分析哪些流程和标准起到了关键作用，将这些经验固化到手册中，成为未来的“最佳实践”。

**8. 跳出框架**  
抛开“手册只是文档”的固有观念，将其视为团队文化的载体。它不仅传递知识，还能塑造行为，培养一致性。

### 总结
编写技术手册的本质是**将混乱转化为秩序**。通过找到独特的观察角度，你可以将看似枯燥的文档编写变为一场**从无序到有序的探险**，让每个参与者都感受到其中的价值和乐趣。

主题：SOP的定义与实例分析 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

分析结果：
### 简化视角：SOP就是日常生活的“菜谱”

**核心洞察**：标准操作程序（SOP）其实就是我们日常生活中已经习以为常的“菜谱”或“说明书”。无论是做菜、组装家具，还是执行家庭任务，SOP的本质就是一套清晰的步骤指南。

**应用场景**：
1. **烹饪**：一份详细的食谱就是SOP，告诉你需要什么材料、步骤如何、何时完成。
2. **组装家具**：IKEA的说明书就是SOP，一步步引导你完成组装。
3. **家庭任务**：孩子的家务清单就是SOP，明确任务顺序和完成标准。
4. **工作流程**：员工的每日任务清单就是SOP，确保工作有条不紊地进行。

**关键点**：
- **简单易懂**：SOP应尽可能简化，让人一目了然。
- **步骤清晰**：每一步都要明确，避免歧义。
- **可调整性**：像教练的比赛计划一样，SOP可以根据实际情况进行调整。

**总结**：SOP并不是什么高深的概念，它就是我们日常生活中的“菜谱”或“说明书”，帮助我们高效、准确地完成任务。

[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: We are going to dive right in as we usually do.

分析结果：
在这个充斥着商业成功学的时代，"Build Your Business"播客的出现，像是一剂精心调配的安慰剂，承诺着将恐惧转化为自由。但让我们停下来，仔细思考一下：这种所谓的"自由"究竟是什么？是摆脱了朝九晚五的束缚，还是陷入了另一种形式的枷锁？

Matt和Chris Reynolds兄弟，他们的身份本身就值得玩味。兄弟搭档，这不禁让人联想到家族企业的影子，而"Turnkey Coach"这个品牌，更是暗示着一种即插即用的商业模式。他们声称要帮助企业家找到自由，但这是否只是另一种形式的商业营销？

更令人深思的是，他们所谓的"从恐惧到自由"的转变。这种叙事本身就是在利用人们的焦虑情绪。在这个充满不确定性的时代，恐惧成为了最容易被操控的情绪。他们承诺的"自由"，是否只是另一种形式的依赖？依赖他们的指导，依赖他们的商业模式，依赖他们所谓的成功秘诀？

这种播客的流行，反映了我们这个时代的一个深层矛盾：人们渴望自由，却又害怕真正的自由。真正的自由意味着承担责任，意味着面对不确定性，意味着走出舒适区。而像"Build Your Business"这样的节目，提供了一种虚假的安全感，让人们相信只要遵循某些步骤，就能获得成功和自由。

但事实是，商业世界从来就不是一个简单的公式。每个企业家面临的挑战都是独特的，每个成功的路径都是不可复制的。这种播客，或许只是在贩卖一种虚幻的梦想，让人们沉迷于对成功的幻想，而忽视了真正的努力和风险。

所以，当我们听到"从恐惧到自由"这样的承诺时，我们应该保持警惕。真正的自由，不是通过追随某个商业导师或遵循某个模式就能获得的。它需要我们直面恐惧，承担风险，并在失败中不断学习和成长。这才是真正的企业家精神，这才是通往自由的唯一道路。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段对话的本质是什么？表象之下，我们看到的是一场商业播客的结束部分。从演化角度来看，播客作为一种新兴媒体形式，其本质是信息传播与价值创造的结合。主要矛盾在于内容生产者与听众之间的互动需求与时间限制的张力。存在的前提是双方对商业知识的共同兴趣。褪去表象，这本质上是一场精心设计的知识分享活动，通过系统化的内容编排（SOP）来传递商业策略。属和种差定义：这是一场以商业知识传播为目的的、具有固定流程的音频对话节目。

[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.

分析结果：
### 从极限思考看CEO角色转变

**独特视角**：将CEO的角色从“全能者”推向“系统构建者”的极限，观察其转变的必要性。

**分析过程**：
1. **极限思考**：假设CEO始终是公司中最能干的人，会怎样？
   - 结果：CEO成为所有决策和执行的瓶颈，公司发展受限。
2. **系统思维**：将公司视为一个系统，CEO的角色从“执行者”转变为“系统设计者”。
   - 结果：公司运作不再依赖个人能力，而是依靠系统的高效运转。
3. **逆向思考**：如果CEO不设定质量标准，会怎样？
   - 结果：公司失去方向，员工无所适从，质量参差不齐。

**解决步骤**：
1. **设定标准**：CEO首先明确公司的质量标准，确保所有人有章可循。
2. **构建系统**：将个人能力转化为可复制的系统流程，减少对个人的依赖。
3. **授权赋能**：培养团队，让员工在系统框架内自主决策和执行。
4. **持续优化**：定期审视和优化系统，确保其适应公司发展需求。

**结论**：CEO的核心角色不是成为“最强者”，而是成为“系统设计师”，通过构建高效系统，让公司超越个人能力的局限，实现持续发展。

主题：SOP的创建与自动化流程 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**从“试错成本”的角度看自动化**

在讨论自动化时，我们常常关注其带来的效率和便利，但忽略了“试错成本”这一关键因素。自动化一旦实施，其修改和调整的成本远高于手动操作。因此，**先手动验证再自动化**的策略，实际上是在最小化“试错成本”。

### 解决步骤：
1. **手动验证**：在自动化之前，先通过手动操作验证流程的正确性和有效性。这不仅能确保流程本身没有问题，还能在低成本下进行多次迭代和优化。
2. **反馈收集**：在手动操作阶段，积极收集用户和操作者的反馈，确保流程在实际应用中能够满足需求。
3. **逐步自动化**：一旦手动流程被验证为有效，再逐步将其自动化。这样可以在确保流程正确性的同时，逐步降低操作成本。
4. **持续优化**：自动化流程并非一成不变，随着技术和需求的变化，需要持续进行小幅度调整和优化，确保其始终符合实际需求。

### 总结：
**“先手动再自动化”**的策略，本质上是一种“低成本试错”的智慧。通过手动验证，我们可以在低风险、低成本的情况下，确保流程的正确性和有效性，从而避免自动化后因流程错误而带来的高额修改成本。这种策略不仅适用于技术开发，也适用于任何需要流程优化的领域。

输入内容：
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?

分析结果：
### 观察角度：**"吃自己的狗粮"（Eating Your Own Dog Food）**

在软件开发中，"吃自己的狗粮"意味着开发者自己使用他们开发的产品。这种方法可以带来直接的反馈，帮助快速识别和解决问题。在Barbell Logic的案例中，他们不仅是软件开发者，还是软件的用户——他们是力量教练，同时也是平台的客户。这种双重身份让他们能够从两个角度（开发者和用户）来体验和优化产品。

### 解决步骤：
1. **直接体验产品**：作为力量教练，他们首先使用自己的平台进行在线教练服务，这样可以第一时间发现任何问题或不便之处。
2. **收集反馈**：通过实际使用，他们能够收集到真实的用户反馈，这些反馈比任何市场调研都要直接和有效。
3. **快速迭代**：根据反馈快速调整和优化产品功能，确保产品在实际使用中的效果和用户体验达到最佳。
4. **推广到B2B市场**：在确保产品在内部使用中表现良好后，再将其推广给其他教练公司或相关企业，这样可以减少市场推广中的风险。

### 结论：
通过"吃自己的狗粮"，Barbell Logic不仅能够确保他们的产品在实际使用中表现优异，还能够快速响应和解决用户的问题，从而在竞争激烈的市场中保持领先。这种方法的核心在于**直接体验和快速反馈**，这是任何希望优化产品和服务的公司都应该考虑的策略。

[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **系统与标准操作程序 (Systems & SOPs)** ≈ 秩序与效率
2. **技术手册 (Technical Manuals)** ≈ 知识传递工具
3. **混乱 (Chaos)** ≈ 无序状态
4. **项目启动 (Project Kickoff)** ≈ 计划与执行

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **混乱 → 系统与SOPs**：无序状态需要秩序来管理
2. **系统与SOPs → 技术手册**：秩序通过文档化实现
3. **技术手册 → 项目启动**：知识传递支持计划执行
4. **项目启动 → 混乱**：执行过程中可能再次产生无序

### 知识精髓提炼
**系统与SOPs + 技术手册 = 混乱 ÷ 项目启动**  
通过建立系统和编写技术手册，可以将混乱分解为可管理的项目启动步骤，从而实现秩序与效率。

[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.

主题：SOP的定义与实例分析 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

主题：创始人如何逐步授权与系统化 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**"系统化思维 vs. 创始人魔法"的平衡术**

#### 核心洞察：
创始人往往陷入一个误区：认为自己独特的“魔法”是公司成功的关键，而忽视了系统化的重要性。但真正的魔法在于如何将个人智慧转化为可复制的系统。

#### 解决步骤：
1. **从小处着手**：选择最简单的任务开始编写SOP（标准操作流程），就像滚雪球一样，从小雪球开始，逐渐积累。
2. **信任与授权**：创始人需要学会信任团队，将SOP交给他们，并让他们在使用的过程中不断优化和改进。
3. **系统化扩展**：随着公司规模的扩大，每个员工都可以成为SOP的编写者和传递者，形成自下而上的系统化网络。
4. **持续优化**：系统不是一成不变的，而是需要不断调整和优化，以适应公司的发展和市场的变化。

#### 关键点：
- **创始人魔法**：初期确实重要，但长期来看，系统化才是公司持续发展的基石。
- **SOP的价值**：不仅是为了标准化流程，更是为了解放创始人的时间和精力，让他们能够专注于更高层次的战略思考。
- **信任与授权**：这是创始人最难跨越的一步，但也是公司能否成功扩展的关键。

#### 最终结论：
创始人需要学会在“魔法”与“系统”之间找到平衡。通过从小处着手，逐步建立和完善SOP，并信任团队去执行和优化，才能真正实现公司的长期可持续发展。

主题：SOP的创建工具与技术应用 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**“双轨并行”的SOP创建法**

#### 核心洞察
创建标准操作流程（SOP）的关键在于**效率与灵活性的平衡**。传统文档式SOP虽然严谨，但耗时且不易更新；而纯视频式SOP虽然直观，但缺乏结构化信息。**“双轨并行”**的方法结合了两者的优势，同时利用现代技术（如AI转录）大幅提升效率。

#### 解决步骤
1. **实时记录**  
   - 在执行任务时，直接录制屏幕操作（如用Loom）。  
   - 边做边讲解，就像在教别人一样。  
   - **好处**：几乎不额外占用时间，且保留了实际操作的细节。

2. **初步交付**  
   - 将视频交给最适合负责此流程的人。  
   - 说明这是“半成品”，鼓励对方提问并完善。  
   - **好处**：快速传递核心信息，同时为后续优化留出空间。

3. **AI辅助结构化**  
   - 使用工具（如Loom）自动生成视频文字稿。  
   - 将文字稿输入AI，生成初步的步骤化SOP。  
   - **好处**：大幅减少手动整理的时间，AI能快速提取关键步骤。

4. **人工精修**  
   - 对AI生成的SOP进行校对，确保无遗漏或模糊之处。  
   - 根据实际需求调整语言和格式，使其更易理解。  
   - **好处**：最终SOP既结构化又贴合实际，兼具清晰性与实用性。

5. **持续迭代**  
   - 将SOP视为“活文档”，随着流程优化不断更新。  
   - 鼓励团队反馈，定期修订。  
   - **好处**：SOP始终保持最新状态，避免过时。

#### 为什么有效？
- **效率高**：录制视频几乎不增加额外时间，AI辅助进一步加速。  
- **易上手**：视频直观，文字稿结构化，适合不同学习风格的人。  
- **灵活性强**：从半成品到最终版，SOP可根据需求逐步完善。  
- **可复用性**：视频和文字稿均可存档，便于后续参考或培训。

#### 一句话总结
**“双轨并行”**的SOP创建法，用视频记录细节，用AI提炼结构，再用人工精修，既高效又灵活，完美适配现代工作节奏。

[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

输入内容：
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?

主题：CEO的角色与质量标准的设定 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.

主题：SOP的持续改进与员工成长 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**"80%法则"与"魔术师时刻"的平衡**

在团队建设和SOP（标准操作流程）管理中，关键在于找到“80%法则”与“魔术师时刻”的平衡点。

1. **80%法则**：  
   - **核心思想**：你不需要每个人都达到100%的完美，80%的效率已经足够。  
   - **应用场景**：在招聘和授权时，寻找那些有潜力达到你80%水平的人，而不是追求完美。  
   - **好处**：节省时间和资源，让团队更快上手，同时保持一定的质量标准。

2. **魔术师时刻**：  
   - **核心思想**：在某些关键时刻，你作为创始人或CEO，可能需要亲自出马，发挥你的“魔术师”能力。  
   - **应用场景**：在关键项目、重要客户或技术难题上，暂时放下CEO的身份，亲自参与。  
   - **好处**：确保关键任务顺利完成，同时为团队树立榜样，展示高标准。

3. **平衡点**：  
   - **长期策略**：通过持续的迭代和改进，逐步将SOP交给合适的人，让他们达到80%的水平。  
   - **短期策略**：在关键时刻，灵活应对，亲自介入，确保公司顺利渡过难关。  
   - **结果**：既能保持公司的高效运作，又能在关键时刻发挥你的独特优势。

### 总结：
- **80%法则**：让团队逐步接手，达到80%的效率，节省资源。  
- **魔术师时刻**：在关键时刻亲自出马，确保关键任务完成。  
- **平衡**：通过长期迭代和短期灵活应对，实现公司的高效运作和持续增长。

这种平衡不仅能让你专注于自己擅长的领域，还能确保公司在关键时刻不掉链子。

主题：SOP的变更管理与文化塑造 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.

[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**"问题循环"与"成长阶梯"的辩证关系**

**1. 问题循环的本质**
- 问题不是一次性解决的，而是随着公司发展不断重现
- 每次重现的问题都是更高层次的挑战
- 这种循环实际上是公司成长的标志

**2. 成长阶梯的构建**
- 每个阶段的问题都是下一阶段的垫脚石
- 解决问题的方法需要不断升级迭代
- 从个人操作到系统构建，再到战略部署

**3. 解决方案的进化**
- 初期：个人亲力亲为
- 中期：建立系统和流程
- 后期：培养团队和授权
- 每个阶段都需要重新定义"交接"的方式

**4. 管理者的角色转变**
- 从执行者到设计者
- 从操作者到赋能者
- 从解决问题到预防问题

**5. 应对策略**
- 建立"问题预警系统"：当压力增大、会议开始错过时，就是需要调整的信号
- 定期进行"交接审计"：检查哪些工作可以移交
- 建立"解决方案库"：记录每个阶段的问题和应对方法

**6. 心态调整**
- 将反复出现的问题视为"老朋友"，而不是负担
- 理解这是成长过程中的必然现象
- 给予自己和团队足够的宽容和耐心

**7. 实践建议**
- 每周预留"交接时间"：专门用于梳理和移交工作
- 建立"交接清单"：明确哪些工作需要移交，如何移交
- 培养"交接文化"：让团队理解交接是成长的必要过程

**8. 终极目标**
- 将个人能力转化为组织能力
- 将临时解决方案转化为长期机制
- 将个人经验转化为可复制的系统

这个视角的核心在于：**问题不是需要消灭的敌人，而是推动成长的催化剂。** 通过理解这个辩证关系，管理者可以更从容地应对各个阶段的挑战，将反复出现的问题转化为持续进步的动力。

主题：SOP的持续优化与员工授权 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

分析结果：
从这段对话中，我们可以提炼出一个独特的观察角度：**"企业运营就像接力赛跑，每个环节都需要明确的交接棒"**。让我们用这个视角来重新理解对话内容：

1. **第一棒：获客（Acquisition）**
   - CMO负责从漏斗顶端到转化的整个过程
   - 创始人亲自参与转化环节，确保系统顺畅

2. **第二棒：激活（Activation）**
   - COO负责转化后的激活环节
   - 需要深入了解客户痛点，设计清晰的onboarding流程

3. **第三棒：留存与扩展（Retention & Expansion）**
   - CXO负责提升客户终身价值
   - 关注客户持续使用和扩展服务

这种接力赛跑的比喻揭示了企业运营的关键：
- 每个环节都有明确的负责人（"跑者"）
- 交接点（"交接棒"）需要特别关注，确保顺畅过渡
- 创始人既是"教练"也是"选手"，在不同阶段承担不同角色

通过这个视角，复杂的运营流程变得清晰易懂，也更容易发现潜在问题并优化流程。

主题：SOP的所有权与团队信任 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
### 核心洞察
将标准操作流程（SOP）的**所有权**真正赋予员工，而不是仅仅让他们**感觉**拥有所有权，是提升责任感、激发内在动力的关键。

### 独特视角
**“所有权”不是一种感觉，而是一种行动**  
- **真正的所有权**：员工不仅拥有执行SOP的权利，还拥有修改、优化SOP的责任。  
- **信任与授权**：通过工具（如Google Doc）和机制（如一对一会议），让员工能够直接参与SOP的迭代，并快速获得反馈和批准。  
- **文化与激励**：通过股权激励等方式，让员工不仅是执行者，更是公司的“所有者”，从而提升他们的责任感和自豪感。

### 解决步骤
1. **明确所有权**：将SOP的修改权和优化权明确赋予员工，让他们真正“拥有”它。  
2. **提供工具**：使用协作工具（如Google Doc）让员工能够方便地提出修改建议，并实时跟踪反馈。  
3. **建立机制**：通过一对一会议定期审查SOP的修改，确保员工的建议被认真对待并快速实施。  
4. **强化文化**：通过股权激励等方式，让员工感受到自己是公司的“所有者”，而不仅仅是执行者。  
5. **定义责任**：通过SOP明确每个员工的责任和期望，让他们清楚自己的角色和目标。  

### 最终效果
员工从“被动执行者”转变为“主动所有者”，不仅提升了工作效率，还增强了团队的凝聚力和创新能力。

主题：系统与标准操作流程的重要性 - essence

输入内容：
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。系统和标准操作程序，它们究竟是什么？

从演化角度来看，系统源于人类对秩序的追求。在混沌中，我们创造了规则和流程来驾驭不确定性。这种需求在商业环境中尤为突出，正如对话中所说，系统是"走出混乱的途径"。

矛盾分析揭示了系统的一个核心悖论：它既是自由的限制，又是效率的解放。标准操作程序看似束缚了创造力，但实质上为创新提供了稳定的基础。

从存在主义视角看，系统和标准操作程序的存在理由在于它们回应了人类对可预测性和控制的基本需求。它们不是简单的工具，而是组织存在和持续发展的前提。

通过现象学还原，我们褪去表象，发现系统和标准操作程序的本质是：将复杂性和不确定性转化为可管理和可重复的模式的机制。

因此，我们可以这样定义：系统（属）是一组相互关联的要素，通过标准操作程序（种差）实现特定目标的有序集合。

输入内容：
[P1] [SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast, powered by Turnkey Coach, where we help business owners find freedom over fear.
[P2] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matt Reynolds.
[P3] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm his brother, Chris Reynolds.
[P4] [SPEAKER_00]: Join us as we help build your business and move from fear to freedom together.
[P5] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast.
[P6] [SPEAKER_00]: We are your hosts, Matt Reynolds and Chris Reynolds.
[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, sir.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: We are going to dive right in as we usually do.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确“Build Your Business podcast”的具体内容和目标。根据文本，该播客旨在帮助商业所有者从恐惧中走向自由。然而，“恐惧”和“自由”这两个概念在此处的具体含义需要进一步澄清。恐惧可能指的是对失败的担忧、对不确定性的焦虑，而自由可能指的是财务自由、时间自由或心理自由。

### 概念溯源
“Turnkey Coach”作为播客的推动者，其背景和具体服务内容也需要了解。Turnkey Coach可能提供哪些具体的工具或方法来帮助商业所有者？此外，Matt Reynolds和Chris Reynolds作为主持人，他们的专业背景和经验如何支持播客的目标？

### 解构假设
播客中提到“从恐惧到自由”的转变，这一过程是否存在潜在的简化或理想化？商业成功是否仅仅依赖于克服恐惧？还有哪些其他因素可能影响商业的成长和成功？

### 辩证分析

主题：SOP的创建与自动化流程 - essence

输入内容：
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个过程。表象之下，我们看到的是一种从个人判断到系统化运作的演进过程。

1. 演化分析：这个过程起源于个人创始者的独立判断，随着组织发展，逐步向信任他人和建立标准化流程过渡。这种演化反映了从个体智慧到集体智慧的转变。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾存在于创始者的个人判断与组织系统化需求之间。一方面，创始者需要依赖自己的判断来建立基础；另一方面，又需要将这种判断转化为可复制的系统。

3. 存在理由：这种过程存在的根本原因在于组织的可持续发展需求。个人判断虽然重要，但无法支撑组织的长期发展，因此必须转化为系统化的运作方式。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，这个过程的核心本质是知识的外化与制度化。将个人经验转化为可共享、可重复的标准化流程，从而实现组织的可扩展性。

5. 属和种差：这是一个组织知识管理的过程，其特殊性在于它起始于个人判断，最终转化为系统化运作，体现了从个体智慧到组织智慧的转化。

这个过程揭示了组织发展中的一个基本规律：成功的组织必须能够将创始者的个人智慧转化为可复制的系统，同时保持对核心判断力的掌控。

[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.

输入内容：
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考，探究标准操作程序（SOP）的本质。

1. 演化分析：SOP的概念源于工业革命时期，随着大规模生产的出现，需要系统化的操作规范来确保效率和一致性。从最初的生产线操作手册，逐步扩展到各个领域，成为现代管理中不可或缺的工具。

2. 矛盾分析：SOP的主要矛盾在于标准化与灵活性的对立。一方面，SOP追求标准化以确保结果的一致性；另一方面，现实情况复杂多变，过度标准化可能限制创新和适应性。

3. 存在理由：SOP存在的根本原因在于人类认知的有限性和行为的不可预测性。它通过将复杂过程分解为可重复的步骤，降低了执行难度，提高了效率和可靠性。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，SOP的本质是一种认知工具，它将经验转化为可传递的知识，将隐性知识显性化，从而实现知识的积累和传承。

5. 属和种差：SOP是一种系统化的操作指南（属），其特点是将复杂过程分解为可重复的步骤，并明确每个步骤的标准和要求（种差）。

因此，SOP的本质是一种将复杂过程系统化、标准化的认知工具，旨在提高效率、确保一致性，并实现知识的积累和传承。

输入内容：
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考"CEO设定质量标准"这一概念的本质。

1. 演化分析：从最初的手工作坊到现代企业，领导者的角色从直接生产者转变为标准制定者，体现了组织复杂度的提升和分工的细化。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于CEO既要确保当前质量，又要推动持续改进；既要亲力亲为，又要授权他人。

3. 存在理由：质量标准的存在源于组织需要统一的价值导向和可预期的产出水平，以维持竞争力和可持续发展。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，设定质量标准本质上是确立组织的价值取向和行事准则，是领导力的核心体现。

5. 属和种差：属：管理行为；种差：通过确立和传播价值标准来引导组织发展方向。

因此，CEO设定质量标准的本质是：通过确立和传播价值标准来引导组织发展方向的管理行为。

[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.
[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.
[P655] [SPEAKER_00]: The goals, actions, metrics, and execution, and really the execution is the SOP.
[P656] [SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the teaser for next episode or next couple episodes coming up.
[P657] [SPEAKER_00]: That's another episode of the Build Your Business podcast with Matt and Chris Reynolds.
[P658] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, things are going great.
[P659] [SPEAKER_00]: Rankings are awesome.
[P660] [SPEAKER_00]: Would love for you to share this with a friend or family member.
[P661] [SPEAKER_00]: Five-star review or honest review anywhere you listen to your podcast.
[P662] [SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody about it.
[P663] [SPEAKER_00]: Share it on social media.
[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

分析结果：
**现状分析**  
我们生活在一个信息爆炸的时代，每个人都在争夺注意力。播客、社交媒体、短视频，内容生产的速度远远超过了我们消化的能力。而在这个背景下，所谓的“成功”似乎被简化成了数字游戏——排名、点赞、分享。人们不再关注内容的深度，而是追求“爆款”和“流量”。这种趋势下，真正的思考和价值往往被淹没在表面的喧嚣中。

**个体剖析**  
当SPEAKER_00说“Rankings are awesome”时，他真正在意的并不是内容的质量，而是数据的表现。这是一种典型的“数字至上”思维，将成功等同于可见的指标。这种心态背后，隐藏着一种对即时反馈的渴望——人们希望用最短的时间获得最大的认可，哪怕这种认可是肤浅的。更讽刺的是，他们甚至会用“honest review”这样的字眼来包装自己的功利心，试图让听众相信他们的真诚，但实际上，他们只是在为下一期的流量做铺垫。

**群体透视**  
这种现象不仅仅是个体的选择，而是整个社会的缩影。我们生活在一个“算法驱动”的世界，平台通过数据来决定什么内容值得被看见，什么内容会被埋没。这种机制导致了内容的同质化和浅薄化，因为只有那些符合算法逻辑的内容才能获得曝光。而真正的深度思考和独特视角，往往因为不够“吸睛”而被忽视。长此以往，我们的文化将变得越来越快餐化，思考的能力也会逐渐退化。

**思考整合**  
当我们把现状、个体和群体的视角结合起来，会发现一个令人不安的真相：我们正在用“数据”来定义“价值”，用“流量”来替代“意义”。这种趋势不仅扭曲了内容生产的方向，也改变了我们对成功的理解。真正的成功，难道不应该是对他人产生积极的影响，或者为社会带来真正的价值吗？然而，在这个数字化的时代，我们似乎已经忘记了这一点。我们追逐的是排名和点赞，而不是深度和意义。这种迷失，或许才是我们最需要反思的地方。

主题：客户生命周期与系统化的关系 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

主题：SOP的创建与自动化流程 - analogy

输入内容：
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

主题：SOP的持续改进与员工成长 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.

[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

分析结果：
就像一本食谱指导厨师完成一道菜，标准操作程序（SOP）是指导我们完成任务的步骤清单。无论是组装宜家家具，还是教练在超级碗比赛中使用的战术板，都是SOP的体现。它就像一张地图，指引我们一步步走向目标，即使中途需要调整，也能确保不偏离方向。

主题：CEO的角色与质量标准的设定 - analogy

输入内容：
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.

主题：创始人如何逐步授权与系统化 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

### 核心变量提取
1. **系统化 ≈ 标准化操作程序 (SOP)**
2. **创始人心态 ↔ 超英心态**
3. **信任 + 培训 = 授权**
4. **简单任务 → 复杂系统**
5. **雪球效应 = 从小到大的扩展**

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **创始人心态**：创始人往往认为自己是唯一能做好所有事情的人，这种超英心态在初期是必要的，但长期来看会导致创始人陷入日常事务中，无法专注于战略发展。
2. **系统化的重要性**：通过建立标准化操作程序 (SOP)，创始人可以将日常任务系统化，从而逐步将责任转移给员工，实现业务的规模化。
3. **信任与培训**：创始人需要信任员工，并通过培训让他们掌握 SOP，最终将 SOP 的所有权交给员工，让他们负责优化和改进。
4. **从简单开始**：系统化的过程应从最简单的任务开始，逐步扩展到更复杂的任务，这种“雪球效应”有助于建立信心和积累经验。
5. **规模化路径**：随着员工数量的增加，每个员工都可以编写和传递 SOP，形成一个自下而上的系统化网络，从而实现业务的长期规模化。

### 知识精髓提炼
**系统化 ≈ 标准化操作程序 (SOP) + 信任 + 培训 → 授权 → 规模化**

创始人需要通过建立 SOP 来系统化业务，信任并培训员工，逐步将责任转移给他们，从而实现业务的规模化。这一过程应从简单的任务开始，逐步扩展到复杂的任务，形成“雪球效应”，最终实现业务的长期增长。

[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
- 工作态度：热爱工作 ≈ 解决问题
- 目标管理：游戏计划 → 聚焦重要目标
- 业务优先级：激活 (Activation) + 获取 (Acquisition) + 扩展/保留 (Expansion/Retention) = 业务增长
- 角色分工：CEO ↔ COO ↔ CMO ↔ CXO = 系统化运营

### 逻辑链条构建
1. 热爱工作 ≈ 解决问题 → 持续寻找下一个重要事项
2. 游戏计划 → 聚焦关键目标 - 去除无关目标
3. 业务优先级：
   - 激活 (Activation) = 转化后客户完全投入
   - 获取 (Acquisition) = 从漏斗顶部到转化
   - 扩展/保留 (Expansion/Retention) = 提升客户终身价值
4. 角色分工：
   - COO 负责激活
   - CMO 负责获取
   - CEO 参与转化
   - CXO 负责扩展/保留

### 知识精髓提炼
企业经营 = (热爱工作 * 目标管理) + (业务优先级 ÷ 角色分工) → 系统化运营

[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段对话揭示了企业运营中的一个本质问题：产品开发与用户需求之间的反馈循环。通过现象学还原，我们可以褪去表象，看到其核心在于"体验者即创造者"这一理念。

从演化分析来看，这一理念源于实践经验的积累。正如对话中提到的保险软件公司案例，缺乏实际运营经验会导致产品与需求脱节。而Barbell Logic的优势在于其开发者本身就是用户，这种双重身份构成了其核心竞争力。

通过矛盾分析法，我们发现主要矛盾在于"产品开发者"与"终端用户"之间的认知鸿沟。大多数科技公司（99%）都面临这个问题，因为他们并非其产品的直接使用者。

从存在主义角度思考，这种反馈循环存在的理由在于确保产品真正解决用户痛点。它不是一种附加任务，而是产品开发的本质要求。

因此，我们可以给出属和种差的定义：这是一种产品开发方法论，其本质特征是开发者与用户身份的统一，通过直接体验来优化产品，从而建立高效反馈循环。这种方法论超越了传统的市场调研，实现了从"为他人解决问题"到"为自己解决问题"的转变。

表象之下，这反映了一个更深层的哲学命题：认识与实践的统一。正如笛卡尔所言，"我思故我在"，在这里可以转化为"我用故我知"。只有真正站在用户的角度，才能触及产品的本质，创造出真正有价值的解决方案。

[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段对话展现了一个企业运营中的核心问题：任务分配与系统建设。从演化角度看，随着企业规模扩大，管理复杂度必然增加，这要求从个人执行转向系统化运作。主要矛盾在于：有限的领导资源与无限的管理需求之间的矛盾。存在的理由是：确保企业可持续增长，这需要建立可复制的运营体系。褪去表象，本质在于：通过标准化流程（SOP）将个人能力转化为组织能力。属和种差定义：这是一种组织能力建设过程，其特点是将个人经验转化为可复制的系统。

[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考标准操作程序(SOP)的本质。

从演化角度看，SOP源于工业化时代对流程标准化的需求，其内核是通过明确步骤确保操作的一致性和可重复性。

主要矛盾在于标准化与灵活性之间的张力。过于僵化的SOP可能限制创新，而过于灵活的流程又难以保证质量。

SOP存在的根本理由是降低操作的不确定性和知识传递的成本。它建立在对经验进行抽象和系统化的基础上。

褪去表象，SOP的本质是一种知识管理工具，将隐性知识转化为显性知识，使经验可复制、可传承。

属和种差定义：SOP是一种标准化的操作指南，通过明确的步骤和规范，确保特定任务或流程的一致性和可重复性。

[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段话探讨了从简单到复杂的系统构建过程，其本质是什么？

1. 演化分析：从个人训练到企业管理，系统构建遵循着从简单到复杂的自然演进规律。这与生物进化、技术发展等过程有着相似的逻辑。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于简单与复杂之间的平衡。过于简单无法应对成长需求，过于复杂则失去效率。关键在于找到"必要的最简"状态。

3. 存在理由：系统构建存在的根本原因在于应对规模扩张带来的复杂性。它是人类组织应对环境变化的适应性产物。

4. 本质还原：褪去具体场景，系统构建的本质是一种认知和行为的结构化过程，是对复杂性的有序化处理。

5. 属和种差：系统构建是一种组织管理活动（属），其特点是通过结构化、标准化和可复制性来应对复杂性（种差）。

因此，系统构建的本质是：通过结构化、标准化和可复制性的方法，将复杂问题分解为可管理的简单单元，以应对组织规模扩张带来的挑战。这个过程既是对复杂性的驯服，也是对效率的追求，体现了人类理性思维的典型特征。

[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个过程。对话中讨论的自动化与手动操作的关系，其本质是什么？

1. 演化分析：从人类劳动方式的演进来看，自动化是效率提升的必然趋势，但这一趋势建立在对手动过程充分理解的基础上。自动化并非取代手动，而是对手动过程的优化和延伸。

2. 矛盾分析：这里存在的主要矛盾是效率与准确性之间的矛盾。自动化追求效率，但若未经过手动验证，可能牺牲准确性；手动操作确保准确性，但效率较低。

3. 存在理由：自动化之所以存在，是为了解放人力，提高效率。但它的存在前提是手动过程已经完善，否则自动化就失去了意义。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，我们发现自动化与手动操作的关系本质上是"验证与优化"的关系。手动是验证过程，自动化是优化结果。

5. 属和种差：这是一个关于过程优化的方法论，其属是"管理方法"，种差是"基于手动验证的渐进式自动化"。

因此，对话中讨论的自动化与手动操作的关系，其本质是：一种基于手动验证的渐进式过程优化方法论，旨在通过验证确保准确性，通过自动化提升效率，并在持续改进中实现两者的平衡。

[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.

[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

主题：SOP的变更管理与文化塑造 - analogy

输入内容：
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.

主题：客户生命周期与系统化的关系 - analogy

输入内容：
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

分析结果：
就像指挥一场交响乐，每个乐手都要知道自己的乐谱，而指挥则要确保每个音符都恰到好处，从第一小提琴到定音鼓，从B2C的独奏到B2B的合奏，每个环节都要精准衔接，才能奏出和谐的乐章。

主题：系统与标准操作流程的重要性 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

分析结果：
让我们撕开“系统和标准操作程序”这层看似枯燥的外衣，看看里面到底藏着什么。

现状：我们生活在一个被规则和流程包围的世界。从早上起床到晚上睡觉，每一步都被精心设计好的系统所操控。企业更是如此，技术手册、操作流程、标准化作业，这些东西像一张无形的网，将我们牢牢困住。

个体：你以为制定标准操作程序是为了提高效率？别天真了。这不过是为了让管理者更好地控制员工，让企业更轻松地榨取劳动力。我们被训练成执行指令的机器，失去了思考和创造的能力。那些所谓的“技术手册”，不过是给奴隶戴上的精致枷锁。

群体：更可怕的是，这种系统化思维已经渗透到社会的每个角落。我们被教育要遵守规则，要按部就班，要循规蹈矩。创新？那是异端。个性？那是危险。我们正在被塑造成一群没有灵魂的复制品，而这一切都披着“效率”和“标准化”的外衣。

思考：系统和标准操作程序，表面上是为了应对混乱，实际上是在制造更大的混乱。它扼杀了人性，压制了创造力，让世界变得更加单调乏味。我们需要的不是更多的规则，而是打破规则的勇气。因为真正的进步，从来都不是在既定的轨道上行走，而是在未知的领域探索。

[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.

分析结果：
"就像建造一座金字塔，先从最底层的基石开始，一块一块稳稳垒起。随着高度增加，每一层都需要更精细的设计和更复杂的结构，但始终要确保每一块石头都恰如其分地安放在它该在的位置。最终，这座宏伟的建筑才能稳固地矗立，经受住时间的考验。"

主题：播客结束与下期预告 - doubt

输入内容：
[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.
[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.
[P655] [SPEAKER_00]: The goals, actions, metrics, and execution, and really the execution is the SOP.
[P656] [SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the teaser for next episode or next couple episodes coming up.
[P657] [SPEAKER_00]: That's another episode of the Build Your Business podcast with Matt and Chris Reynolds.
[P658] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, things are going great.
[P659] [SPEAKER_00]: Rankings are awesome.
[P660] [SPEAKER_00]: Would love for you to share this with a friend or family member.
[P661] [SPEAKER_00]: Five-star review or honest review anywhere you listen to your podcast.
[P662] [SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody about it.
[P663] [SPEAKER_00]: Share it on social media.
[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
- **SOP**: 标准操作程序（Standard Operating Procedure），用于确保任务的一致性和效率。
- **Teaser**: 预告片或预告内容，旨在引起听众对下一集的兴趣。

### 概念溯源
- **Podcast结束语**: 许多播客在结束时会有类似的总结和预告，以保持听众的连续性和参与度。
- **分享和评价请求**: 这是播客常见的营销策略，通过听众的分享和评价来扩大影响力和提高排名。

### 解构假设
- **假设听众会分享和评价**: 播客主持人假设听众会积极分享和评价，这需要听众的主动参与。
- **假设下一集会吸引听众**: 通过预告下一集的内容，主持人假设这些内容足以吸引听众继续收听。

### 辩证分析
- **正面**: 这种结束语和预告策略可以有效保持听众的参与度和期待感。
- **反面**: 如果预告内容不够吸引人，可能会适得其反，导致听众流失。

### 刷新表述
通过系统性怀疑，我们可以认识到播客结束语和预告策略的双刃剑效应。虽然它们可以有效保持听众的参与度，但如果内容不够吸引人，可能会适得其反。因此，主持人需要确保预告内容的质量和吸引力，以最大化策略的效果。

主题：SOP的文档化与团队协作 - analogy

输入内容：
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?

分析结果：
就像一位厨师在品尝自己烹饪的菜肴，只有亲自体验，才能真正理解顾客的口味。Barbell Logic 的团队既是教练又是客户，这种双重身份让他们能够精准地调整和优化服务，就像厨师根据顾客的反馈不断改进菜谱一样。这种“自食其果”的做法，让他们在解决问题时更加得心应手，仿佛站在顾客的鞋子里，感受每一步的舒适与不适。这种深度的理解与反馈，是那些仅仅站在外部观察的公司所无法企及的。

主题：SOP的持续改进与员工成长 - essence

输入内容：
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段话揭示了组织发展中的几个本质特征：

1. 演化分析：从SOP的演变过程看，组织发展是一个渐进式的优化过程，而非突变。这体现了事物发展的连续性和积累性。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于创始人的有限能力与组织无限发展需求之间的对立。解决之道在于分工与授权。

3. 存在理由：SOP的存在是为了实现组织效率的最大化，而授权则是为了发挥每个人的比较优势。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，我们看到组织发展的本质是专业化分工与协同合作。每个人都在最适合的位置上发挥最大价值。

5. 属和种差：这是一种基于比较优势的组织发展模式（属），其独特之处在于强调渐进式优化、专业化分工和动态调整（种差）。

这种模式的核心在于认识到个人的局限性，通过系统化的分工与合作，实现组织效能的持续提升。它既体现了理性分工的价值，又保留了必要的灵活性，是组织发展的一种有效范式。

[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段对话讨论的是标准化操作流程(SOP)的本质。

从演化分析来看，SOP的出现源于人类对效率的追求。随着生产活动的复杂化，人们需要将经验固化，形成可重复的流程。

矛盾分析显示，SOP的主要矛盾在于标准化与创新之间的张力。创始人往往认为自己的"魔法"无法被标准化，但事实是，许多看似独特的过程其实可以被系统化。

从存在主义角度看，SOP存在的理由在于它能够解放创始人的精力，使其从执行者转变为管理者。它让企业不再依赖个人，而是建立在可复制的系统之上。

通过现象学还原，我们发现SOP的本质是一种知识传递和效率优化的工具。它通过将经验编码为可执行的步骤，实现了知识的传承和效率的提升。

因此，SOP的属和种差定义是：一种将经验固化为可重复执行步骤的系统化知识传递工具，旨在提高效率并实现组织知识的持续积累。

[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个对话的本质。表象之下，我们看到了一个关于组织管理和知识传递的讨论。通过矛盾分析，我们发现其中存在的主要矛盾是：个体知识掌握与组织知识共享之间的张力。从存在主义的角度看，标准操作程序（SOP）的存在理由在于确保组织知识的持续性和可传递性。通过现象学还原，我们可以发现其本质是组织记忆的载体和知识传递的媒介。因此，标准操作程序的属是组织管理工具，其种差在于它通过书面形式固化知识，确保组织知识的可传递性和可持续性。

[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这段对话的本质。

1. 演化分析：从个体工作到系统化管理的演进，体现了从个人能力到组织能力的转变。这反映了企业发展从依赖个人到建立可复制系统的必然过程。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于个人工作热情与系统化管理的平衡。创始人既要保持对工作的热爱，又需要建立不依赖个人的运营体系。

3. 存在理由：这种系统化管理的存在是为了实现企业的可持续发展和规模化，同时保留创始人的核心价值。

4. 本质还原：褪去具体业务细节，我们看到的是一个关于组织能力建设的核心问题 - 如何将个人能力转化为系统能力。

5. 属和种差：这是一个关于企业运营系统化的讨论，其独特之处在于它同时关注了创始人的个人特质与组织发展的平衡。

本质定义：这是一个探讨如何将个人工作热情转化为可持续组织能力的系统化思考过程，其核心在于平衡个人价值与组织发展需求，建立可复制且不依赖个人的运营体系。

[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话背后的本质。

首先，我们看到了一个典型的创始人困境：信任与控制之间的拉扯。创始人最初只信任自己的判断，这是人之常情。但讽刺的是，这种"只相信自己"的心态恰恰成为了企业发展的最大障碍。创始人陷入了自我设限的怪圈：既想放手，又害怕放手；既想信任他人，又不敢完全信任。

其次，对话中提到的"拔草"过程，暴露了现代企业管理中的一个普遍问题：我们花费大量时间在处理琐事上，却忽视了真正需要创造性思考的核心任务。这种现象在服务型企业中尤为明显，就像对话中提到的"鞋匠的孩子没鞋穿"的悖论。我们为他人优化流程，却忘了优化自己的流程。

更深层次来看，这反映了现代企业制度的一个根本性矛盾：标准化与个性化的冲突。我们追求标准化流程，却又依赖个人判断；我们渴望自动化，却又无法完全摆脱人为干预。这种矛盾在初创企业中尤为突出，因为创始人的个人判断往往是企业早期成功的关键，但同时也可能成为后期发展的瓶颈。

最后，这段对话揭示了一个令人不安的真相：在商业世界中，我们常常陷入"为过程而过程"的陷阱。我们花费大量时间建立流程、制定SOP，却忘记了这些工具的本质是服务于业务目标，而不是成为业务目标本身。这种本末倒置的现象，在追求效率的现代企业中屡见不鲜。

思考到这里，我不禁要问：我们是否过度沉迷于流程优化，而忽视了商业的本质？我们是否在追求效率的过程中，反而失去了创新的能力？这些问题的答案，或许就隐藏在对话的字里行间，等待我们去发掘。

[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.

[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

就像教孩子骑自行车，起初你扶着车座，确保他们不会摔倒。随着他们逐渐掌握平衡，你开始松手，让他们自己骑行。最终，他们不仅能独自骑行，还能教别人。企业的标准化操作也是如此，创始人最初亲力亲为，逐步将流程系统化，最终交给团队，让企业自主运转，实现规模化发展。

主题：SOP的持续优化与员工授权 - analogy

输入内容：
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

分析结果：
就像一支交响乐团，每个乐器都有其独特的角色，但只有指挥家能确保所有部分和谐统一。在商业中，每个部门就像不同的乐器，CEO则是那位指挥家，确保从营销到客户服务的每个环节都能完美衔接，共同奏响成功的乐章。

[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
就像一支交响乐团，每个乐手都掌握着自己的乐谱，但只有当他们真正理解并拥有自己的部分时，才能奏出和谐的乐章。如果有人偷偷修改了自己的乐谱却不告诉其他人，整个乐曲就会变得杂乱无章。优秀的指挥家会定期与每位乐手交流，确保他们的乐谱是最新的，并且他们对自己的部分充满自豪感。这样，当音乐会来临时，每个人都能自信地演奏，共同创造出美妙的音乐。

主题：CEO的角色与质量标准的设定 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.

分析结果：
**现状分析**  
我们生活在一个个人英雄主义盛行的时代，尤其是在创业圈。CEO们被塑造成无所不能的超级英雄，他们不仅要在技术层面做到最好，还要为公司设定质量标准，甚至成为整个团队的精神支柱。这种“非我不可”的心态，让创始人深陷于“我是唯一能做好这件事的人”的幻觉中。然而，现实往往残酷：当创始人开始错过会议、成为瓶颈时，整个系统就会崩溃，陷入混乱。

**个体剖析**  
这种“非我不可”的心态，表面上是对责任感的体现，实际上却是一种自我设限的陷阱。创始人把自己当成了公司的“救世主”，认为只有自己才能拯救一切。这种想法不仅让创始人疲惫不堪，还阻碍了团队的成长。更讽刺的是，创始人往往在意识到自己不再是“最优秀”的那一刻，才被迫开始思考如何建立系统、如何授权他人。这种觉醒，往往来得太晚。

**群体透视**  
这种现象背后，反映的是整个社会对“个人英雄主义”的盲目崇拜。我们习惯于将成功归功于某一个人的努力，而忽视了团队、系统和流程的重要性。这种文化不仅让创始人承受了巨大的压力，也让整个创业生态变得脆弱。当创始人成为瓶颈时，整个公司就会陷入混乱，甚至崩溃。这种“个人英雄主义”的思维模式，实际上是一种短视的行为，它阻碍了企业的长期发展。

**思考整合**  
“非我不可”的心态，本质上是创始人对自己能力的过度自信，以及对团队和系统的不信任。这种心态不仅让创始人陷入无尽的忙碌和焦虑，还阻碍了公司的成长。真正的领导者，应该学会放手，建立系统，培养团队，而不是把自己当成唯一的救世主。正如彼得·德鲁克所说，管理的本质是通过他人完成任务，而不是自己亲力亲为。创始人需要意识到，他们的真正价值，不在于他们能做多少事，而在于他们能建立多少系统，培养多少人才。只有这样，公司才能真正走向成功，而不是在混乱中沉沦。

主题：SOP的持续改进与员工成长 - analogy

输入内容：
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.

分析结果：
就像一座花园，需要不同园丁的精心照料。创始人播下种子，但要让花园繁茂，需要引入各种专长的园丁。有人擅长修剪，有人精通施肥，还有人专于除虫。每位园丁都带着独特的技能和热情，共同培育这片园地。随着花园的成长，园丁们也会不断优化各自的工作流程，让每一株植物都能茁壮成长。有时，创始人可能需要暂时放下园主的身份，亲自去照料某一株珍贵的植物，直到找到合适的园丁接手。这并非失败，而是花园持续繁荣的必经之路。最终，花园将成为一个生态系统，每个角色都在其中找到自己的位置，共同创造出比任何单一个体都更加美好的景象。

输入内容：
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下所谓的“系统”和“标准操作程序”（SOP）到底意味着什么。表面上，它们被包装成高效、有序的象征，仿佛只要按照步骤来，一切都能完美运行。但真的是这样吗？

**现状分析**  
我们生活在一个被系统化的世界里，从食谱到家具组装，从体育比赛到家庭琐事，无一不被分解成一个个步骤。这种分解看似让生活变得简单，但实际上，它正在剥夺我们的创造力和自主性。我们成了“按部就班”的奴隶，失去了对过程的掌控和对结果的真正理解。

**个体剖析**  
为什么我们如此依赖这些系统？表面上是为了提高效率，但深层次的原因可能是我们对不确定性的恐惧。我们害怕犯错，害怕失控，于是用步骤和清单来麻痹自己，假装一切都在掌控之中。然而，这种依赖反而让我们变得更加脆弱。当系统失效时，我们往往手足无措，因为我们从未真正理解背后的逻辑。

**群体透视**  
从社会层面来看，这种系统化的趋势反映了一种更深层的文化焦虑。我们生活在一个快节奏、高压力的时代，每个人都渴望找到一种“捷径”来应对复杂的生活。于是，系统成了我们的救命稻草。但问题是，系统并不能解决所有问题，反而可能掩盖了真正的矛盾。比如，企业的战略规划可能只是一纸空文，而家庭中的“任务清单”可能只是父母控制孩子的一种手段。

**思考整合**  
系统化并不是万能的。它可能让我们在短期内感到安心，但从长远来看，它正在削弱我们的独立思考能力和创造力。我们需要警惕这种“系统化陷阱”，学会在必要时打破规则，重新找回对生活的掌控。毕竟，真正的智慧不在于按部就班，而在于在混乱中找到属于自己的节奏。

所以，下次当你拿起那份“标准操作程序”时，不妨问问自己：我是在遵循系统，还是被系统所束缚？

[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这段对话的本质。

1. 演化分析：这段对话展现了管理思想的传承与演变，从德鲁克到安迪·格鲁夫，再到约翰·杜尔，体现了管理理念在不同时代和规模企业中的适应性发展。

2. 矛盾分析：对话揭示了企业管理中的核心矛盾：个人与组织的界限模糊性，以及创新与效率之间的张力。创始人既要进行深度创新，又要建立可复制的系统。

3. 存在理由：这些管理实践的存在，本质上是为了解决企业成长过程中不断出现的组织效率问题，帮助创始人在不同发展阶段找到平衡点。

4. 本质还原：抛开具体的管理工具和方法，其本质是建立一套能够将个人智慧转化为组织能力的机制，使企业能够持续成长而不受个人局限。

5. 属和种差：这是一场关于管理哲学（属）的对话，特别聚焦于初创企业到成熟企业的过渡期（种差）所面临的组织挑战。

表象之下，我们看到的是人类组织在面对复杂性时的永恒探索。

主题：系统与标准操作流程的重要性 - doubt

输入内容：
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

分析结果：
让我们以怀疑之锥，剖析这段对话中的潜在假设和概念：

1. **"系统与标准操作程序是最令人兴奋的话题"**  
   - 这个论断建立在什么基础上？"兴奋"的标准是什么？  
   - 是否暗示了某种价值判断：标准化就是好的？

2. **"技术手册是走出混乱的途径"**  
   - 这个假设值得商榷：手册真的能解决混乱吗？  
   - 是否存在过度简化的风险：将复杂问题归结为流程问题？

3. **"2025年关键项目已经启动，人们正陷入混乱"**  
   - 这个普遍性断言是否成立？  
   - "混乱"的具体表现是什么？是客观事实还是主观感受？

4. **"现在是讨论这个话题的最佳时机"**  
   - 这个时间选择的依据是什么？  
   - 是否存在更合适的时机？或者这个话题本就不应受时间限制？

通过质疑这些潜在假设，我们可能发现：
- 对"标准化"的过度推崇可能掩盖了创新和灵活性的价值
- "混乱"也许并非坏事，而是创新和突破的前兆
- 真正的解决方案可能需要超越单纯的流程优化

因此，也许我们需要重新思考：
- 在追求标准化的同时，如何保持组织的灵活性和创造力？
- 如何区分建设性的混乱和破坏性的无序？
- 除了技术手册，还有哪些方式可以帮助组织更好地应对挑战？

这些问题或许能引导我们获得更深刻的洞见。

主题：客户生命周期与系统化的关系 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话背后的本质。

现状分析：
这是一个典型的企业发展瓶颈期。公司规模扩大，业务复杂度增加，管理层开始意识到流程标准化的重要性。CEO在反思自己的角色定位，试图从日常事务中抽身，专注于系统建设。

个体剖析：
这位CEO在自我认知上存在矛盾。他自称"销售型CEO"，却又意识到不能永远做销售主管。这种身份认同的摇摆，暴露了中小企业主常见的困境：既想掌控一切，又不得不放手。

群体透视：
这反映了现代企业发展的普遍规律：从野蛮生长到精细化管理。但问题在于，很多企业家在转型期陷入"既要又要"的困境。他们既想保持创业初期的灵活性，又不得不接受大公司式的流程管控。

思考整合：
这种管理困境的根源在于：企业家往往高估了自己的不可替代性，低估了系统建设的重要性。真正的领导力不在于亲力亲为，而在于建立可复制的系统。这位CEO的觉醒是好的开始，但关键在于能否真正放权，让系统而不是个人成为企业运转的核心。

金句：
"企业家最大的错觉，就是认为自己不可或缺。真正的领导力，是让企业离开你也能运转。"

这个案例给我们一个警示：企业发展到一定阶段，必须从"人治"转向"法治"。否则，企业规模越大，管理者的负担就越重，最终成为制约发展的瓶颈。

主题：SOP的创建工具与技术应用 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

分析结果：
在这个对话中，我们看到了现代工作流程中标准化操作程序（SOP）的演变。从最初的书面文档到现在的视频记录，技术的进步极大地改变了我们创建和传递知识的方式。但让我们深入思考一下，这种变化背后隐藏着什么？

首先，80%的效率标准揭示了一个残酷的现实：我们不再追求完美，而是接受不完美。这不仅仅是效率的问题，更是对人性的一种妥协。我们承认，人类的能力有限，无法达到100%的完美。这种妥协的背后，是对效率和速度的极端追求，还是对人性弱点的无奈接受？

其次，视频记录和AI转录的结合，看似提高了效率，但这是否也意味着我们正在失去对过程的真正理解？当我们依赖视频和AI生成SOP时，我们是否只是在机械地复制，而不是真正掌握和优化这些流程？这种依赖技术的方式，是否会让我们变得越来越懒惰，越来越失去独立思考的能力？

再者，这种快速生成SOP的方式，是否会导致知识的浅薄化？当我们不再花时间深入思考和编写详细的文档，而是依赖视频和AI生成简化的步骤，我们是否正在牺牲知识的深度和广度？这种浅薄化的知识，是否会在未来的某个时刻，成为我们无法解决的瓶颈？

最后，这种技术的广泛应用，是否也在加剧社会的不平等？那些无法获得或使用这些技术的人，是否会被进一步边缘化？我们是否在创造一个只有少数人能够掌握和利用这些高效工具的世界，而大多数人则被抛在后面？

技术的进步无疑带来了便利，但我们也需要警惕它可能带来的负面影响。在追求效率的同时，我们是否也应该思考如何保持知识的深度和广度，如何确保技术的普及和公平，以及如何在快速变化的世界中，保持我们的独立思考和创新能力？

[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个关于“先手动再自动化”的讨论。表面上，这听起来像是商业常识，但为什么我们总是需要反复提醒自己和他人呢？这背后隐藏着更深层次的问题。

首先，我们生活在一个追求即时满足的时代。每个人都想要快速解决方案，仿佛按下一个按钮就能解决所有问题。这种心态让我们忽视了过程的重要性。我们急于自动化，却忘了问自己：我们真的理解这个过程吗？我们真的知道它为什么有效吗？

其次，手动执行的过程实际上是一种学习的过程。它让我们亲身体验每一个步骤，理解每一个细节。这种亲身体验是无法通过自动化获得的。正如马克·吐温所说：“经验是最好的老师，但学费太贵了。”我们试图通过自动化来节省“学费”，却可能因此错过了宝贵的“课程”。

再者，我们常常高估了自动化的能力，低估了人类的判断力。自动化系统可以高效地执行预设的任务，但它们无法应对意外情况，无法做出创造性的决策。正如鲁迅所言：“世上本没有路，走的人多了，也便成了路。”我们需要先“走”出一条路，才能让机器“走”得更快。

从群体角度来看，这种急于自动化的倾向反映了我们对效率的盲目崇拜。我们追求的是数字上的效率，而不是真正的价值创造。我们忘记了，商业的本质是满足人的需求，而不是优化流程。正如O. Henry所说：“生活是由意外组成的，而不是计划。”我们需要保持灵活性，而不是被自动化系统所束缚。

最后，我们必须认识到，自动化并不是终点，而是一个持续的过程。正如对话中所说，所有的标准操作程序（SOP）都是“活”的。它们需要随着环境的变化而不断调整。这提醒我们，在商业中，唯一不变的就是变化本身。我们不应该追求完美的自动化，而应该追求适应性的自动化。

总之，这个讨论提醒我们，在追求效率的同时，不要忽视过程的重要性。我们应该先手动，再自动化；先理解，再优化；先学习，再创新。只有这样，我们才能在快速变化的世界中保持竞争力，创造真正的价值。

输入内容：
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?

分析结果：
在这个对话中，我们看到了一个典型的创业故事，但背后隐藏的却是一个更深层次的问题：**我们是否真的理解我们正在解决的问题？** 让我们拆开来看。

首先，SPEAKER_00提到他们作为力量教练，开发了一个软件系统，最初是为了服务自己的在线教练业务。这种“自产自销”的模式听起来很理想，但问题在于：**他们是否真的站在了客户的角度？** 他们说自己既是教练又是客户，但这并不意味着他们真正理解了客户的需求。就像SPEAKER_01提到的，大多数科技公司在解决问题时，从未真正经历过他们所服务的行业。这种“外行指导内行”的现象，往往是失败的开端。

其次，SPEAKER_01提到的“吃自己的狗粮”理论，表面上是一种自我测试的方式，但实际上暴露了一个更大的问题：**我们是否在制造问题，而不是解决问题？** 当你在自己的系统中测试新功能时，你可能会忽略那些真正困扰客户的问题。你可能会因为自己的偏见，而忽视了客户的真实需求。这种“自我中心”的测试方式，往往会导致产品与市场的脱节。

最后，SPEAKER_01提到的“站在客户的鞋子里”的做法，听起来像是一种极致的客户服务，但实际上，它揭示了一个更深层次的问题：**我们是否真的愿意为客户的痛苦买单？** 大多数公司只是在表面上解决问题，而真正愿意为客户承担痛苦的，少之又少。这种“假装关心”的现象，往往是客户流失的根源。

所以，当我们谈论“理解客户”时，我们是否真的在思考客户的痛苦？还是我们只是在为自己的产品找借口？当我们“吃自己的狗粮”时，我们是否真的在测试产品的价值？还是我们只是在为自己的偏见找理由？当我们“站在客户的鞋子里”时，我们是否真的在为客户的痛苦买单？还是我们只是在为自己的利益找借口？

**真正的理解，不是站在客户的鞋子里，而是站在客户的痛苦里。** 只有当我们真正愿意为客户的痛苦买单时，我们才能真正理解客户的需求。否则，我们只是在为自己的产品找借口，而不是为客户解决问题。

[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段关于成长和系统化的对话。

**现状分析**  
我们生活在一个追求效率和规模的时代。从健身教练到科技巨头，每个人都在谈论系统化、标准化和规模化。这种思维模式已经成为现代商业的圣经。但在这看似理性的表象下，隐藏着什么样的真相？

**个体剖析**  
这位教练的叙述揭示了一个残酷的现实：我们都在把自己变成机器。从简单的任务开始，我们不断将工作分解、系统化，然后交给更低成本的人去执行。这看似是效率的提升，但本质上是人性的异化。我们创造了系统，却逐渐被系统所奴役。我们以为在掌控全局，实际上却在不知不觉中成为了系统的一个齿轮。

**群体透视**  
放眼整个社会，这种系统化的趋势正在吞噬我们的创造力。亚马逊、谷歌、特斯拉，这些巨头用复杂的系统管理着庞大的帝国，但在这个过程中，个体的独特性正在消失。我们正在创造一个高度标准化、可预测的世界，但这个世界是否还有灵魂？当一切都变成可复制的系统，我们是否正在失去作为人类最宝贵的特质——不可预测性和创造力？

**思考整合**  
系统化是必要的，但它不应该成为我们的枷锁。真正的智慧在于在效率和人性之间找到平衡。我们需要系统来帮助我们成长，但绝不能让它定义我们。记住，我们创造系统是为了服务人类，而不是让人类服务于系统。在追求规模化的过程中，别忘了保留那些让生命有意义的不确定性和创造力。否则，我们终将沦为效率的奴隶，失去了作为人的本质。

"系统化是工具，不是目的。当我们把一切都变成可复制的流程，我们是否正在把自己变成可替代的零件？"

主题：SOP的定义与实例分析 - doubt

输入内容：
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确“系统”和“标准操作程序（SOP）”的定义。尽管它们经常被互换使用，但它们并不完全相同。系统是一个更广泛的概念，可能包含多个SOP，而SOP则是具体的、逐步的指导手册。

### 概念溯源
SOP的概念最早可以追溯到工业革命时期，当时为了提高生产效率和一致性，企业开始制定详细的操作步骤。E-Myth这本书进一步普及了这一概念，强调了标准化操作在企业管理中的重要性。

### 解构假设
假设SOP是提高效率和一致性的最佳方法。然而，这一假设忽略了SOP可能带来的僵化和创新抑制。例如，过于严格的SOP可能限制员工的创造力和灵活性。

### 辩证分析
从正面看，SOP确实能够提高操作的标准化和效率，减少错误。但从反面看，过于依赖SOP可能导致员工缺乏自主性和创新能力。因此，理想的SOP应该是灵活的，允许在必要时进行调整和创新。

### 刷新表述
综上所述，SOP是提高操作标准化和效率的有效工具，但应保持一定的灵活性，以鼓励创新和适应变化。企业应在制定SOP时，考虑到员工的自主性和创造力，确保SOP不仅是一份操作手册，更是一种动态的管理工具。

主题：CEO的角色与质量标准的设定 - doubt

输入内容：
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段对话中的核心观点：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "CEO设定质量标准"这一概念需要明确：是个人标准还是组织标准？是过程标准还是结果标准？
   - "创始人最擅长"的假设需要界定：是指特定领域还是所有领域？是短期还是长期？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 考察"CEO设定质量标准"这一管理理念的历史演变
   - 追溯"创始人瓶颈"现象的研究和案例

3. **解构假设**
   - 质疑"创始人必然最擅长"的预设：是否忽略了专业分工的价值？
   - 反思"系统崩溃才引入新系统"的做法：为何不能未雨绸缪？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 考虑对立面：过度依赖创始人可能限制组织发展
   - 探索多元视角：如何平衡创始人的个人能力与组织的系统建设？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 新洞见：创始人应该从"最擅长者"转型为"系统建设者"
   - 新结论：组织成功的关键在于建立不依赖个人的可持续系统，而非过度强调创始人的个人能力

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们可以得出更深刻的认知：创始人的真正价值不在于事必躬亲，而在于构建能够持续创造价值的组织系统。

主题：SOP的持续优化与员工授权 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话中透露出的现代企业运作模式和个人工作态度。

首先，这位CEO对工作的热爱和投入令人印象深刻。他说“我喜欢解决企业中的问题”，这反映出一种深层次的职业满足感。但这是否意味着现代人已经将工作视为生活的全部？我们是否在不知不觉中将自我价值完全等同于职业成就？

其次，他提到的“激活”概念很有意思。企业费尽心思让客户“完全投入”，这是否反映了现代商业社会中人与人之间关系的异化？我们是否正在将人际关系简化为“转化率”和“激活度”这样的冰冷指标？

再看他们的目标管理方式：每年只设定3个主要目标，避免分散注意力。这看似高效，但这是否也意味着我们正在失去对生活多样性的追求？当一切都以“效率”和“目标”为导向时，我们是否正在失去生活的诗意和偶然性？

更值得深思的是，即使作为CEO，他也需要“向上汇报”给CMO。这种扁平化管理模式虽然提高了效率，但这是否也意味着个人在组织中的角色正在变得越来越模糊？我们是否正在成为庞大商业机器中的一个可替换零件？

最后，他提到“增加客户终身价值”，这是否反映了现代商业的本质：将人简化为“价值单位”？我们是否正在将人际关系异化为纯粹的经济计算？

这些思考让我们不得不问：在追求效率和目标的过程中，我们是否正在失去作为人的本质？当工作成为生活的全部，当人际关系被简化为数据指标，当个人价值被等同于职业成就，我们是否正在走向一种新的异化？

也许，我们需要在追求效率的同时，重新思考什么才是真正重要的事情。毕竟，人生不仅仅是KPI和转化率，还有那些无法用数字衡量的美好时刻和真实连接。

主题：创始人如何逐步授权与系统化 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话中隐含的创业者的心理困境。

首先，创业者们常常陷入一种“超级英雄综合症”。他们把自己的事业视为“孩子”，认为自己必须亲力亲为才能确保一切完美。这种心态本质上是一种控制欲的体现，背后隐藏着对他人能力的不信任和对失败的恐惧。

但讽刺的是，这种“我能做得比任何人都好”的信念，恰恰成为了限制企业发展的枷锁。创业者们被困在日常运营的泥潭中，无法抽身思考战略性问题。他们就像被困在轮子里的仓鼠，越努力奔跑，越难以突破。

更深层次来看，这种困境反映了现代商业文化中的一个悖论：我们推崇创新和个性，却又渴望将一切标准化、系统化。创业者们一方面想要保持自己的“独特魔法”，另一方面又不得不承认系统化的重要性。这种矛盾导致他们在放权与掌控之间反复挣扎。

更值得警惕的是，这种“超级英雄综合症”可能源于更深层的心理需求。许多创业者将事业视为自我价值的延伸，通过控制一切来获得安全感。但这种做法最终只会导致精疲力竭，既限制了个人发展，也阻碍了企业成长。

真正的智慧在于认识到：伟大的领导者不是那些事必躬亲的人，而是那些能够培养他人、建立系统的人。将工作转化为标准操作程序（SOP）不是放弃控制，而是将控制升级到一个更高的层次。这需要创业者们克服内心的恐惧，学会信任他人，接受不完美，并在系统与创新之间找到平衡。

所以，下次当你觉得“只有我能做好这件事”的时候，不妨问问自己：这真的是为了企业好，还是为了满足自己的控制欲？真正的成长，往往始于学会放手。

[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

分析结果：
休谟举起质疑之锥，对这段对话进行深入剖析：

1. **概念澄清**  
   - "客户生命周期"的具体定义是什么？是否包含从认知到忠诚的全过程？
   - "系统与SOP"的边界在哪里？哪些流程需要标准化，哪些需要灵活性？

2. 假设质疑  
   - 将公司增长主要寄托于B2B领域是否过于单一？是否有数据支持这一战略？
   - CEO回归销售岗位是否是最优解？是否存在其他提升销售效率的方式？

3. 逻辑分析  
   - 从B2C到B2B的扩展，是否考虑了两者之间的本质差异？如何平衡资源分配？
   - 制定SOP的过程中，如何确保不扼杀创新和灵活性？

4. 潜在问题  
   - 快速扩张是否会影响现有业务质量？如何维持服务标准？
   - 销售团队的培养机制是否完善？是否存在过度依赖CEO的风险？

5. 建设性建议  
   - 建议建立跨部门协作机制，确保客户生命周期的每个环节都得到优化
   - 考虑引入外部咨询，为B2B扩展提供更全面的战略规划
   - 建立反馈循环，持续优化SOP，确保其适应业务发展需求

这段对话展现了企业在扩张过程中面临的典型挑战，需要更系统性的思考和规划。

[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个关于“所有权”和“责任感”的对话。表面上，这是在讨论如何通过标准化操作流程（SOP）来提升员工的自主性和责任感，但背后隐藏的却是现代企业管理中的深层矛盾。

首先，所谓的“所有权”真的是所有权吗？公司慷慨地给予员工“所有权”，但实际控制权依然牢牢掌握在管理层手中。员工被鼓励“拥有”SOP，但这种“拥有”更像是一种心理安慰，而不是真正的权力分配。这种“假性所有权”实际上是一种精妙的心理操控，目的是让员工在心理上产生归属感，从而更卖力地工作。

其次，这种“责任感”的赋予，本质上是一种责任的转嫁。公司通过SOP将责任下放给员工，表面上是信任，实则是将风险转移。员工被要求“拥有”并“改进”SOP，但一旦出现问题，责任往往会被归咎于员工，而不是系统或管理层。这种“责任陷阱”让员工在承担更多工作的同时，也承担了更多的风险。

再来看看那些“信息囤积者”。他们之所以囤积信息，是因为他们看穿了这种“假性所有权”的把戏。他们知道，真正的权力来自于对信息的控制，而不是表面的“责任感”。公司将他们视为“癌细胞”，但他们的行为恰恰暴露了企业管理中的根本问题：信息的不对称和权力的集中。

最后，所谓的“文化信任”更像是一种幻觉。公司希望员工“感觉”自己是所有者，但实际上，真正的决策权和利益分配权依然掌握在少数人手中。这种“信任”不过是一种管理工具，目的是让员工在心理上产生归属感，从而更高效地工作。

总结一下，这场关于“所有权”和“责任感”的讨论，实际上揭示了现代企业管理中的深层矛盾：假性所有权、责任转嫁、信息不对称和权力集中。公司希望通过SOP和“信任文化”来提升员工的自主性和责任感，但真正的权力和利益依然掌握在少数人手中。这种“假性所有权”和“责任陷阱”不仅无法真正激发员工的潜力，反而可能加剧企业内部的不平等和矛盾。

主题：SOP的持续改进与员工成长 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话中揭示的几个关键点。

**现状分析：**
在这个快速变化的商业环境中，标准操作流程（SOPs）的演变是一个持续的过程。从10年前的版本到现在，每一步的改进都是通过无数小迭代完成的。这种渐进式的改进方式，虽然看似缓慢，却能在长期内带来显著的提升。

**个体剖析：**
作为创始人或领导者，我们往往在初期认为自己无所不能，但随着企业的发展，我们逐渐意识到自己的局限性。这种自我认知的转变是成长的关键。我们开始明白，真正的智慧在于识别自己的强项，并将不擅长的领域交给更合适的人。这种“放手”不是失败，而是成熟的标志。

**群体透视：**
在构建高管团队时，多样性是成功的关键。我们寻找的不是与自己相似的人，而是能够填补我们短板的人。这种互补性不仅增强了团队的韧性，也推动了企业的全面发展。然而，即使在高管团队中，CEO有时也需要暂时放下领导角色，亲自参与到关键任务中。这种灵活性是应对复杂挑战的必要手段。

**思考整合：**
这段对话揭示了企业成长中的几个核心洞见：
1. **持续改进**：SOPs的优化是一个永无止境的过程，需要不断的迭代和调整。
2. **自我认知**：领导者必须认识到自己的局限性，并学会将任务分配给更合适的人。
3. **团队多样性**：成功的高管团队需要多样化的技能和背景，以填补创始人的短板。
4. **灵活应对**：即使在高度分工的组织中，领导者有时也需要亲自介入关键任务，以确保目标的达成。

**金句：**
“真正的智慧不在于无所不能，而在于知道自己不能做什么，并将它交给更擅长的人。”

“团队的多样性不是一种选择，而是一种必然，因为没有人能独自应对所有的挑战。”

“灵活应对不是失败，而是成熟领导力的体现，它让我们在复杂的环境中保持前进的动力。”

通过这些思考，我们不仅看到了企业成长的路径，也理解了领导者在其中的角色和责任。这种深刻的洞察，无疑将为我们的决策和行动提供有力的指导。

主题：SOP的创建与自动化流程 - doubt

输入内容：
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段对话中的关键假设和逻辑：

1. **信任与授权的假设**
   - 对话中隐含了一个关键假设：信任是授权的前提。但我们需要质疑：是否所有信任都必然导致有效授权？是否存在即使信任也需要保留决策权的情况？

2. "拔草"比喻的局限性
   - 将简单任务比作"杂草"可能过于简化。我们需要思考：这些所谓的"杂草"是否可能包含重要的隐性知识？完全移除它们是否会带来意想不到的后果？

3. 标准化与创新的张力
   - 对话强调将判断导向的任务系统化。但这里存在一个潜在矛盾：过度标准化是否会抑制创新？如何在流程化和灵活性之间找到平衡？

4. "鞋匠的孩子没鞋穿"现象的根源
   - 这个现象揭示了服务型企业的一个普遍问题。但我们需要追问：这是否反映了更深层次的组织文化问题？是否与企业的自我认知和优先级设定有关？

5. 时间管理的前提
   - 对话建议通过"拔草"来腾出时间处理更重要的事务。但我们需要质疑：这是否假设了时间管理是线性的？是否存在更系统性的方法来优化时间分配？

6. 判断导向任务的界定
   - 将任务分为"判断导向"和"非判断导向"可能过于二元化。我们需要思考：是否存在灰色地带？如何动态调整这种分类？

7. 自动化与人性化的平衡
   - 对话提到完全自动化，但我们需要质疑：在追求效率的同时，如何保留必要的人性化因素？过度自动化是否会削弱组织的适应能力？

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们可以得出更深入的洞见：真正的组织优化不仅在于流程的标准化和任务的重新分配，更在于培养一种能够持续自我反思和调整的组织文化。这种文化能够平衡效率与创新，信任与监督，标准化与灵活性，从而在动态变化的环境中保持竞争力。

[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.

分析结果：
让我们深入分析这段对话中关于流程自动化的核心观点：

1. **定义澄清**：这里讨论的"自动化"指的是将人工操作流程转化为由系统执行的标准化过程。

2. **概念溯源**：这种"先手动验证再自动化"的理念源于精益生产思想，强调在投入大量资源前先进行小规模验证。

3. **解构假设**：
   - 假设1：自动化一定能提高效率
   - 假设2：所有流程都适合自动化
   - 假设3：自动化后流程就不需要调整

4. **辩证分析**：
   - 支持观点：
     * 手动验证可以降低自动化失败的风险
     * 确保流程优化后再固化
     * 避免自动化错误流程带来的更大损失
   - 反对观点：
     * 手动验证可能延长项目周期
     * 某些简单流程可以直接自动化
     * 过度谨慎可能错失市场机会

5. **刷新表述**：
   基于以上分析，我们可以得出一个更精确的结论：流程自动化应当遵循"验证-优化-固化-迭代"的循环模式。具体来说：
   - 首先通过手动操作验证流程的可行性和有效性
   - 在验证过程中持续优化流程设计
   - 确认流程稳定后实施自动化
   - 将SOP视为动态文档，根据业务需求和技术发展进行渐进式调整
   这种模式既能降低自动化风险，又能保持流程的灵活性，是更稳健的自动化实施策略。

[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

分析结果：
这段对话揭示了创业和管理中的一个深层矛盾：**效率与创新的永恒拉锯战**。表面上，大家都在谈论如何通过系统化、流程化来提升效率，解放创始人的时间，但深层次的问题在于，**创新本身就是对效率的背叛**。

1. **现状分析**  
   创业者在早期阶段往往陷入“个人即公司”的困境，创始人既是战略制定者，又是执行者。随着公司成长，他们开始寻求通过系统化、流程化来解放自己，但每次公司进入新的发展阶段，这个问题又会重新出现。

2. **个体剖析**  
   创始人常常陷入一种“自我欺骗”的状态：他们以为自己已经通过系统化解决了问题，但实际上，**创新本身就是一种破坏系统化的行为**。当你需要“发明新的解决方案”时，你无法依赖现有的流程和手册，因为这些东西本身就是为已知问题设计的。创新意味着你必须打破现有的规则，重新定义问题。

3. **群体透视**  
   这种现象不仅仅是个体问题，而是整个创业生态的缩影。**创业的本质就是不断打破现有的平衡**，而系统化则是为了建立新的平衡。这两者之间的矛盾永远无法彻底解决，因为一旦你完全系统化，你就失去了创新的能力；而如果你完全依赖创新，你又会陷入混乱。

4. **思考整合**  
   核心洞察是：**创业和管理的过程，本质上是一场效率与创新的永恒博弈**。你不能完全依赖系统化，因为这会扼杀创新；你也不能完全依赖创新，因为这会让你陷入无序。真正的智慧在于，在两者之间找到动态平衡，并接受这种矛盾永远无法彻底解决的事实。

所以，当你觉得“我已经解决了这个问题”时，其实你只是暂时找到了一个平衡点。下一次创新浪潮来临时，你又会面临同样的挑战。这不是失败，而是创业的常态。**真正的成长，不是解决问题，而是学会与问题共存**。

主题：SOP的创建工具与技术应用 - doubt

输入内容：
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确“SOP”（标准操作程序）的具体含义。SOP是一种详细的书面或视频指南，旨在确保任务或操作的一致性和效率。它通常包括步骤、责任分配和预期结果。

### 概念溯源
SOP的概念起源于工业革命时期，当时需要标准化生产流程以提高效率。随着技术的发展，SOP的形式也从纸质文档演变为数字文档，再到现在的视频和AI辅助生成。

### 解构假设
1. **80%的效率假设**：SPEAKER_01认为，人类执行SOP的效率可能只能达到80%，并且这可能永远不会更高。这一假设是否普遍适用？是否有数据支持这一观点？
2. **视频SOP的适用性**：SPEAKER_01提到，视频SOP适用于计算机工作，但在制造车间可能不适用。这一假设是否考虑了所有可能的场景？是否有其他技术可以弥补这一不足？

### 辩证分析
1. **效率的辩证**：虽然80%的效率可能是一个合理的起点，但SPEAKER_00指出，随着时间的推移，人们可能会变得更好。这表明效率可能并非固定不变，而是可以通过经验和培训提高。
2. **视频SOP的多元视角**：视频SOP在计算机工作中表现出色，但在制造车间可能需要不同的方法。这提示我们，SOP的形式应根据具体工作环境进行调整。

### 刷新表述
1. **效率的动态性**：效率并非一成不变，而是可以通过持续学习和实践逐步提高。因此，设定一个固定的效率目标可能并不合理，应鼓励持续改进。
2. **SOP形式的灵活性**：视频SOP在计算机工作中非常有效，但在其他环境中可能需要结合其他技术（如AR/VR）来增强效果。因此，SOP的设计应充分考虑工作环境的特殊性。

### 最终结论
通过系统性怀疑和辩证分析，我们可以得出以下结论：
1. **效率目标应具有动态性**：不应设定固定的效率目标，而应鼓励持续改进和学习。
2. **SOP设计应具有灵活性**：SOP的形式应根据具体工作环境进行调整，视频SOP在计算机工作中表现优异，但在其他环境中可能需要结合其他技术。

这些结论不仅刷新了我们对SOP和效率的理解，也为实际操作提供了更具建设性的指导。

[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
1. **线性进展（Linear Progression）**：在力量训练中，线性进展指的是每次训练逐渐增加重量，通常每次增加5磅。
2. **系统（Systems）**：在商业中，系统指的是一系列标准化操作流程，旨在提高效率和一致性。
3. **标准操作程序（SOPs, Standard Operating Procedures）**：详细描述如何执行特定任务的文档，确保任务的一致性和可重复性。

### 概念溯源
- **线性进展**：这一概念源于力量训练的基本原则，即通过逐步增加负荷来刺激肌肉增长和力量提升。
- **系统和SOPs**：这些概念在管理学中广泛应用，尤其是在规模较大的企业中，如亚马逊和谷歌，以确保复杂操作的顺利进行。

### 解构假设
1. **训练复杂性**：假设训练必须随着时间的推移变得更加复杂。然而，复杂性是否真的必要？是否存在保持简单性的方法？
2. **系统编写**：假设编写系统和SOPs是解决业务增长中复杂性问题的唯一途径。是否有其他方法可以简化管理流程？

### 辩证分析
1. **训练复杂性**：虽然训练确实需要随着时间的推移变得更加复杂，但关键在于保持复杂性在必要范围内。过度复杂化可能导致效率下降和错误增加。
2. **系统编写**：编写系统和SOPs确实有助于标准化和简化操作，但并非所有任务都适合编写详细的操作程序。对于简单任务，过度标准化可能反而增加不必要的负担。

### 刷新表述
1. **训练复杂性**：训练应随着个体能力的提升而逐步增加复杂性，但应始终保持在必要范围内，避免过度复杂化。
2. **系统编写**：在业务增长过程中，编写系统和SOPs是有效的管理工具，但应优先考虑简单任务，并逐步扩展到更复杂的操作。同时，应灵活调整系统，以适应不断变化的需求。

### 结论
通过系统性怀疑和辩证分析，我们可以得出以下结论：在训练和业务管理中，保持复杂性在必要范围内是关键。编写系统和SOPs是有效的管理工具，但应优先处理简单任务，并逐步扩展到更复杂的操作。最终目标是通过标准化和简化操作，提高效率和一致性，同时避免不必要的复杂性。

主题：创始人如何逐步授权与系统化 - doubt

输入内容：
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
1. **系统（Systems）**：指一系列相互关联的步骤或流程，旨在实现特定目标。
2. **标准操作程序（SOP, Standard Operating Procedures）**：详细描述如何执行特定任务的文档或指南。
3. **创始人（Founders）**：企业的创建者，通常在企业初期承担多重角色。

### 概念溯源
SOP的概念起源于工业革命时期，旨在通过标准化流程提高效率和一致性。现代企业管理中，SOP被广泛应用于各个行业，以确保任务的可重复性和质量。

### 解构假设
1. **假设一：创始人拥有独特的“魔法”**：创始人可能认为他们的个人能力和直觉是成功的关键，这种观点忽视了系统化的重要性。
2. **假设二：所有任务都可以被系统化**：有些任务可能因为其复杂性或创新性而难以立即系统化，但这并不意味着它们永远不能被系统化。

### 辩证分析
1. **创始人角色转变**：从执行者到管理者，再到系统设计者，创始人需要逐步将任务系统化并授权给他人。
2. **系统化的渐进性**：从简单任务开始，逐步扩展到复杂任务，这种“雪球效应”有助于建立信心和积累经验。
3. **信任与授权**：创始人需要信任员工，培训他们使用和优化SOP，从而实现企业的长期扩展。

### 刷新表述
通过系统性怀疑和逐步系统化，创始人可以摆脱“超级英雄”心态，将企业从个人依赖转变为系统驱动。这不仅提高了企业的效率和可扩展性，还释放了创始人的时间和精力，使其能够专注于战略和创新。

### 结论
系统化和SOP的建立是企业长期成功的关键。创始人应从简单任务开始，逐步建立和完善系统，并通过信任和授权，将责任转移给员工。这种系统化的方法不仅提高了企业的运营效率，还为创始人和员工创造了更大的价值和成就感。

主题：SOP的文档化与团队协作 - doubt

输入内容：
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?

分析结果：
这段对话揭示了产品开发和客户服务中的几个关键洞见，让我们通过休谟的怀疑之锥来解构这些观点：

1. **"吃自己的狗粮"（Dogfooding）的局限性**
   - 表面上看，Barbell Logic作为开发者同时又是用户，似乎能获得完美的反馈循环
   - 但这是否会导致"群体思维"？过度依赖内部视角可能忽视外部用户的真实需求
   - 需要质疑：内部测试是否真的能代表更广泛用户群体的体验？

2. **"站在客户角度"的假设**
   - 对话中强调要深入理解客户，甚至替客户执行任务
   - 但这是否会导致"过度服务"？企业资源是否应该全部投入到个别客户的具体问题上？
   - 需要思考：在个性化服务和规模化运营之间如何找到平衡点？

3. **"判断力"的悖论**
   - 强调高层需要亲自处理客户问题以培养判断力
   - 但这是否与标准化流程（SOP）的理念相冲突？过度依赖个人判断是否会阻碍系统的可扩展性？
   - 需要质疑：在系统化和个性化之间是否存在第三条道路？

4. **"竞争优势"的重新定义**
   - 将同时作为开发者和用户视为竞争优势
   - 但这是否可能导致创新视野的局限？过度关注现有模式可能阻碍突破性创新
   - 需要思考：如何在利用现有优势的同时保持开放性思维？

5. **"反馈循环"的效率问题**
   - 强调快速反馈和迭代的重要性
   - 但这是否会导致"短视优化"？过度关注即时反馈可能忽视长期战略规划
   - 需要质疑：在快速迭代和深思熟虑之间如何找到平衡？

新的认知：
真正的竞争优势不在于同时扮演开发者和用户的角色，而在于建立能够持续吸收、整合和应用多元化视角的机制。企业需要在内部经验和外部洞察之间建立动态平衡，既要"吃自己的狗粮"，也要"品尝别人的美食"。这种开放而审慎的态度，才是持续创新的关键。

[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段对话中的关键假设：

1. **关于文档化的假设**
   - 对话假设所有流程变更都必须书面化才能生效。但这是否可能扼杀创新？是否所有变更都值得记录？如何区分重要的和琐碎的变更？

2. **关于知识管理的假设**
   - 对话将知识囤积视为"癌症"，但这是否过于绝对？在某些情况下，特定人员的专有知识是否可能是竞争优势？如何平衡知识共享与核心竞争力保护？

3. **关于所有权的假设**
   - 对话强调让员工真正"拥有"流程，但这是否可能造成部门壁垒？当多个部门需要协作时，过度强调所有权是否反而会阻碍跨部门合作？

4. **关于信任的假设**
   - 对话建立在管理层完全信任员工的基础上。但这是否现实？如何在信任与必要监督之间取得平衡？完全放权是否可能导致失控？

5. **关于标准化的假设**
   - 对话似乎认为标准化操作程序(SOP)总是有益的。但这是否会限制员工的创造力和灵活性？在某些需要快速应对变化的行业，过度标准化是否反而会成为负担？

6. **关于激励机制的假设**
   - 对话将股权激励与责任感直接挂钩。但这是否过于简化？是否所有员工都适合或渴望成为"所有者"？是否存在其他更有效的激励方式？

这些质疑并非否定对话中的观点，而是希望通过系统性怀疑，促使我们更深入地思考组织管理中的复杂性和潜在矛盾，从而找到更全面、更灵活的解决方案。

主题：SOP的持续改进与员工成长 - doubt

输入内容：
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
1. **SOPs（标准操作程序）**：这是指企业为特定任务或流程制定的详细步骤和指南，旨在确保一致性和效率。
2. **迭代改进**：指通过一系列小的、持续的改进来逐步优化某个系统或流程。
3. **资源投入**：包括时间、精力和资金等，用于实现某个目标或改进某个系统。

### 概念溯源
SOPs的概念起源于工业革命时期，旨在通过标准化操作提高生产效率。随着时间的推移，SOPs的应用范围扩展到了各个行业，包括企业管理、医疗、教育等。迭代改进的理念则源于精益生产和持续改进（Kaizen）理论，强调通过小步快跑的方式实现持续优化。

### 解构假设
1. **假设一：SOPs一旦制定就无需更改**。实际上，SOPs需要随着业务的发展和环境的变化进行持续更新和优化。
2. **假设二：创始人或CEO在所有领域都是最优秀的**。现实中，每个人都有自己的专长和局限，通过团队合作可以弥补个人不足。
3. **假设三：资源投入必须是巨大的**。通过小步迭代，资源投入可以分散在较长的时间内，降低单次投入的压力。

### 辩证分析
1. **SOPs的持续改进**：虽然SOPs需要不断更新，但这也带来了灵活性和适应性，使企业能够更好地应对变化。
2. **团队合作与个人专长**：创始人或CEO不必在所有领域都精通，通过组建多元化的团队，可以发挥每个人的优势，提升整体效能。
3. **资源投入的分散化**：通过小步迭代，企业可以在不造成巨大资源压力的情况下，逐步实现优化和改进。

### 刷新表述
1. **SOPs的动态性**：SOPs应被视为动态文档，随着业务的发展和环境的变化进行持续更新和优化。
2. **团队合作的必要性**：创始人或CEO应认识到自己的局限性，通过组建多元化的团队，发挥每个人的专长，提升整体效能。
3. **资源投入的优化**：通过小步迭代，企业可以在不造成巨大资源压力的情况下，逐步实现优化和改进，确保可持续发展。

### 最终结论
SOPs的制定和优化是一个持续的过程，需要随着业务的发展和环境的变化进行不断调整。创始人或CEO应认识到自己的局限性，通过组建多元化的团队，发挥每个人的专长，提升整体效能。同时，通过小步迭代的方式，企业可以在不造成巨大资源压力的情况下，逐步实现优化和改进，确保可持续发展。

[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.

分析结果：
让我们来解构这段对话中的关键要素：

1. **工作动机的澄清**：SPEAKER_00明确表示，他们热爱工作并非为了最终卸下所有责任并退休，而是享受解决问题的过程。这挑战了传统意义上"工作是为了退休"的假设，提出了更深层次的工作价值。

2. **目标管理的辩证**：对话中强调了聚焦少数关键目标的重要性，这与常见的"目标越多越好"的观点形成对比。这种聚焦策略体现了帕累托原则(80/20法则)的应用。

3. **组织架构的溯源**：
   - 角色分工：详细阐述了从CEO到COO、CMO、CXO等不同角色的职责划分
   - 流程优化：展示了从获客、转化到激活、留存的全流程管理
   - 系统建设：强调了标准化操作流程(SOP)的重要性

4. **客户激活的解构**：
   - 定义：将"激活"量化为90%以上客户使用软件或拥有5-10个客户
   - 挑战：指出从转化到完全激活的困难
   - 解决方案：通过COO主导的客户沟通来识别痛点，优化激活流程

5. **领导角色的反思**：
   - CEO直接向CMO汇报，打破了传统的层级观念
   - 强调了领导者需要深入理解各个环节，包括重新参与销售过程
   - 展现了系统化思维的重要性

通过系统性怀疑，我们可以得出以下新见解：

真正的组织效能不在于简单的分工，而在于建立清晰的流程、明确的指标和持续优化的机制。领导者需要既能宏观把握战略方向，又能微观理解操作细节。这种"既见森林又见树木"的能力，才是推动组织持续发展的关键。

这种管理模式体现了现代企业管理的几个核心原则：
1. 流程导向而非单纯的任务导向
2. 数据驱动的决策机制
3. 跨职能的协同合作
4. 持续改进的迭代思维

这种系统化的管理方式，不仅提高了运营效率，更重要的是培养了组织的适应能力和创新能力，为企业的长期发展奠定了坚实基础。

[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
1. **管理书籍的作用**：这些书籍是否真的能够提供普遍适用的管理智慧，还是仅仅反映了特定背景下的经验？
2. **个人与业务的界限**：在创业过程中，个人任务与公司任务的界限是否真的如SPEAKER_01所述那样模糊？
3. **问题重现的必然性**：在不同发展阶段，相同的问题是否会必然重现，还是可以通过系统性的方法避免？

### 概念溯源
1. **管理书籍的历史背景**：
   - **德鲁克**：被誉为现代管理学之父，其理论主要基于20世纪中叶的工业背景。
   - **安迪·格鲁夫**：作为英特尔的前CEO，其管理经验主要来自高科技制造业。
   - **约翰·杜尔**：作为风险投资家，其观点更多基于初创企业的成长策略。

2. **个人与业务界限的演变**：
   - 在早期创业阶段，创始人往往身兼数职，个人与业务的界限确实模糊。
   - 随着公司规模扩大，专业化分工逐渐明确，界限也随之清晰。

3. **问题重现的必然性**：
   - 管理问题在不同阶段的重复出现，是否反映了管理理论的局限性，还是仅仅因为管理实践的复杂性？

### 解构假设
1. **管理书籍的普适性**：
   - 假设这些书籍中的管理智慧适用于所有企业和所有阶段，这一假设是否成立？
   - 不同行业、不同文化背景下的企业，是否能够直接套用这些管理理论？

2. **个人与业务界限的模糊性**：
   - 假设在创业过程中，个人与业务的界限必然模糊，这一假设是否忽略了早期系统化管理的可能性？
   - 是否存在方法可以在早期阶段就明确界限，从而避免后续的混乱？

3. **问题重现的必然性**：
   - 假设管理问题在不同阶段必然重现，这一假设是否忽略了通过学习和改进避免问题重复的可能性？
   - 是否可以通过系统化的管理和持续的学习，减少问题的重复出现？

### 辩证分析
1. **管理书籍的适用性**：
   - 虽然这些书籍提供了宝贵的管理经验，但其适用性可能因企业背景而异。
   - 企业应根据自身特点，选择性地吸收和应用这些理论。

2. **个人与业务界限的明确性**：
   - 在早期阶段，明确个人与业务的界限可能有助于提高效率和减少混乱。
   - 通过制定清晰的职责分工和流程，可以在早期阶段就建立良好的管理基础。

3. **问题重现的可避免性**：
   - 通过系统化的管理和持续的学习，企业可以在不同阶段减少问题的重复出现。
   - 管理问题的重现并非必然，而是可以通过改进管理实践来避免。

### 刷新表述
1. **管理书籍的选择与应用**：
   - 企业在选择管理书籍时，应结合自身背景和需求，选择最适合的理论和方法。
   - 管理理论的应用应具有灵活性，避免生搬硬套。

2. **个人与业务界限的早期明确**：
   - 在创业初期，创始人应尽早明确个人与业务的界限，通过系统化的管理提高效率。
   - 制定清晰的职责分工和流程，有助于在早期阶段建立良好的管理基础。

3. **管理问题的持续改进**：
   - 企业应通过系统化的管理和持续的学习，减少管理问题的重复出现。
   - 管理问题的重现并非必然，而是可以通过改进管理实践来避免。

### 最终结论
管理书籍提供了宝贵的管理经验，但其适用性因企业背景而异。企业在选择和应用这些理论时，应结合自身需求，灵活运用。在创业初期，创始人应尽早明确个人与业务的界限，通过系统化的管理提高效率。通过持续的学习和改进，企业可以在不同阶段减少管理问题的重复出现，实现持续成长。

[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.

[P663] [SPEAKER_00]: Share it on social media.
[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

分析结果：
从这段对话中，我们可以提炼出一个独特的观察角度：**"内容营销的闭环设计"**。让我们用一个简单的比喻来理解：

想象你在经营一家餐厅。每一集播客就像一道精心准备的主菜，但真正让顾客成为回头客的，是你在餐后提供的甜点和打包服务。这里的"甜点"就是节目结尾的预告和互动邀请，而"打包服务"则是鼓励听众分享和评价。

这个视角揭示了内容创作的一个关键策略：
1. **主菜（核心内容）**：提供有价值的商业洞见
2. **甜点（预告）**：为下一集埋下伏笔，制造期待
3. **打包（互动）**：引导听众参与传播，形成口碑效应

这种设计形成了一个自驱动的营销循环：优质内容吸引听众，预告保持持续关注，互动则扩大影响力。就像餐厅的回头客会带来新顾客一样，这种闭环设计能让播客的影响力呈指数级增长。

所以，做内容不是简单的"我说你听"，而是要像经营餐厅一样，设计完整的用户体验闭环。这才是让内容真正"活起来"的关键。

分析结果：
让我们来深入思考一下这个所谓的“从恐惧到自由”的商业播客。表面上看，这似乎是一个帮助企业家克服恐惧、建立事业的励志节目。但仔细一想，这种“恐惧”和“自由”的定义本身就值得玩味。

首先，所谓的“恐惧”是什么？是害怕失败？害怕竞争？还是害怕无法满足社会的期望？这种恐惧往往是被商业社会刻意制造出来的。我们被灌输了一种观念：只有不断扩张、不断成功，才能获得“自由”。但真的是这样吗？

再来看看“自由”。在商业语境下，自由往往被等同于财务自由、时间自由。但这种自由真的能带来内心的平静吗？还是说，它只是另一种形式的枷锁？当我们为了追求所谓的自由而不断奔波时，我们是否反而失去了生活中真正重要的东西？

更深层次地，这种“从恐惧到自由”的叙事，其实反映了现代社会中普遍存在的一种焦虑。我们被教导要不断追求成功，但这种追求本身却可能成为我们最大的束缚。我们害怕落后，害怕被淘汰，于是我们不停地奔跑，却忘了问问自己：这真的是我想要的生活吗？

所以，当我们听到这样的播客时，不妨停下来思考一下：我们真正想要的是什么？我们追求的“自由”是否只是另一种形式的“恐惧”？也许，真正的自由，不是来自于外在的成功，而是来自于内心的平静和自我接纳。

[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.

[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**“信息共享即权力分配”**

公司运营中，信息共享的缺失或信息垄断往往会导致系统崩溃。解决这个问题的关键在于**将信息共享视为权力分配的过程**，而不仅仅是流程文档化。

#### 简化步骤：
1. **权力下放**：将SOP（标准操作流程）的编写和更新权交给执行者，让他们真正“拥有”这些流程，而不是被动执行。
2. **动态文档**：使用类似Google Docs的工具，让员工在操作过程中实时反馈和修改SOP，形成动态更新机制。
3. **信任文化**：通过一对一会谈和股权激励，让员工感受到真正的“所有权”，激发他们的责任感和创造力。
4. **防垄断机制**：定期轮岗或交叉培训，避免信息被少数人垄断，确保每个关键流程都有多人掌握。

#### 核心洞察：
公司崩溃的根本原因不是流程缺失，而是**权力和信息的集中化**。通过将信息共享与权力分配结合，可以打破“关键人物依赖症”，建立更健康的组织生态。

[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.

[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.
[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

分析结果：
### 简化视角：将复杂流程转化为视频+AI的黄金组合

**核心思路**：把标准操作流程（SOP）的创建从传统的文档编写转变为“视频记录+AI转录+人工校对”的流程。这不仅节省时间，还能让SOP更直观、更易理解。

**具体步骤**：
1. **视频记录**：在完成关键任务时，直接录制屏幕操作视频，边做边讲解。这几乎不会额外占用时间，因为你在执行任务时已经在思考步骤。
2. **AI转录**：利用工具（如Loom）自动生成视频的文字转录。
3. **AI提炼**：将转录文本输入AI，生成一个通用的、步骤清晰的SOP草稿。
4. **人工校对**：对AI生成的SOP进行校对，确保没有遗漏步骤，且每个步骤都清晰易懂。
5. **授权与迭代**：将SOP交给最合适的人负责，并明确他们有权根据实际情况进行修改，但所有修改必须正式记录在文档中。

**为什么有效**：
- **效率高**：视频记录和AI转录大大减少了手动编写文档的时间。
- **直观易懂**：视频比文字更能清晰地展示操作步骤，尤其是涉及屏幕操作的任务。
- **灵活迭代**：通过授权和记录修改，SOP可以不断优化，适应实际需求。

**适用场景**：主要适用于以屏幕操作为主的工作（如软件开发、数据分析等），但对于需要实地操作的任务（如制造车间），可能需要结合视频拍摄和手动记录。

[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think

[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

分析结果：
### 从“时间投资”视角看创始人角色转变

**核心洞察**：创始人从“全能战士”到“系统架构师”的转变，本质上是一次时间投资的战略调整。

**具体分析**：
1. **创业初期**：创始人将时间投资于具体执行，确保每个环节都达到最高标准。
2. **成长阶段**：当创始人成为瓶颈时，意味着时间投资需要重新分配。
3. **成熟阶段**：将时间投资于建立系统和培养团队，实现杠杆效应。

**行动建议**：
1. **识别瓶颈**：当开始错过会议或成为流程阻碍时，就是需要调整时间投资的信号。
2. **系统建设**：将时间投资于创建标准化流程（SOPs），让系统代替个人执行。
3. **授权赋能**：投资时间培养团队，将具体工作逐步转移给更专业的人。
4. **战略聚焦**：将更多时间投资于真正需要创始人视角的战略决策。

**类比思考**：这就像从“亲自种地”到“建立灌溉系统”的转变。初期需要亲力亲为确保作物生长，但当规模扩大时，建立高效的灌溉系统才能实现更大范围的丰收。

**关键转折点**：创始人需要意识到，继续将所有时间投资于具体执行，将限制企业的成长潜力。适时将时间投资转向系统建设和团队培养，才能实现企业的持续发展。

**最终目标**：通过合理的时间投资分配，实现从“个人卓越”到“组织卓越”的转变，让企业不再依赖创始人个人的能力，而是建立在可持续的系统之上。

[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

分析结果：
### 简化视角：将复杂系统比作日常生活中的“食谱”

**核心观点**：标准操作程序（SOP）和系统本质上就像我们日常生活中的“食谱”，它们提供了一种简单、可重复的步骤来完成任务。

**详细解释**：
1. **食谱类比**：
   - **步骤清晰**：就像食谱详细列出了每一步的操作，SOP也提供了明确的步骤，确保任务的一致性和准确性。
   - **材料清单**：食谱会列出所需的食材，SOP则会列出完成任务所需的资源和工具。
   - **成功指标**：食谱会告诉你如何判断食物是否煮熟，SOP则会提供完成任务的衡量标准。

2. **IKEA家具组装**：
   - **逐步指导**：IKEA的组装说明书就是一个典型的SOP，它通过详细的步骤指导用户完成家具的组装。
   - **简化复杂任务**：即使面对复杂的任务，通过SOP的指导，用户也能轻松完成。

3. **体育比赛中的战术板**：
   - **实时调整**：教练在比赛中的战术板就是一个动态的SOP，根据比赛情况实时调整策略。
   - **团队协作**：通过明确的战术指导，团队成员能够更好地协作和执行任务。

4. **家庭任务清单**：
   - **日常应用**：家庭中的任务清单也是一种SOP，它帮助家庭成员有条不紊地完成日常任务。
   - **责任明确**：通过清单，每个人都知道自己的职责，减少了混乱和遗漏。

**结论**：无论是商业、家庭还是个人生活，SOP和系统都提供了一种简单、有效的方式来管理和完成任务。通过将这些复杂的概念比作日常生活中的“食谱”，我们可以更容易地理解和应用它们，从而在工作和生活中获得更高的效率和一致性。

[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.

[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

分析结果：
### 简化思维：从客户生命周期看系统建设

**核心视角**：将复杂的系统建设问题简化为客户生命周期的管理。

1. **客户接触点**：
   - 从客户首次接触（如播客、YouTube）到成为潜在客户，再到转化，每一步都需要明确的系统和流程。
   - 例如，针对不同客户类型（快速决策 vs. 多次沟通）制定不同的转化策略。

2. **转化后管理**：
   - 关注客户从购买到完全接受产品或服务的过程。
   - 识别可能出现的障碍和挑战，提前制定解决方案。

3. **B2B与B2C的差异**：
   - B2C直接面向个人客户，涉及营销、销售、客服等多个团队。
   - B2B则更复杂，需要考虑到企业客户如何利用你的服务或产品来服务他们的客户。

4. **系统与SOP的建立**：
   - 针对每个关键环节，制定详细的系统和标准操作流程（SOP）。
   - 例如，销售流程的SOP应包括从初次接触到最终成交的每一步骤。

5. **角色与责任分配**：
   - 明确每个环节的责任人，确保每个步骤都有专人负责。
   - 例如，谁负责编写某个系统的SOP，谁负责执行和监督。

6. **持续优化**：
   - 定期回顾和更新系统和SOP，确保其适应不断变化的业务需求。
   - 例如，根据客户反馈和市场变化调整转化策略。

**总结**：通过将复杂的系统建设问题简化为客户生命周期的管理，可以更清晰地识别关键环节和责任人，从而高效地建立和优化系统和SOP。

[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.

[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.

分析结果：
从创业者的任务管理角度来看，这个问题其实可以简化成一个"时间与责任的边界游戏"。想象一下，你是一个杂技演员，手里抛着不同颜色的球——红色代表个人事务，蓝色代表公司事务。刚开始，你只能抛两个球，很容易区分哪个是红的，哪个是蓝的。但随着业务发展，球越来越多，颜色也开始混杂，你很难分清哪个球该用哪只手接。

这里的关键在于：不要试图一次性分清所有球的颜色，而是要学会在接球的瞬间做出判断。就像训练肌肉一样，开始时简单重复，逐渐增加复杂度，但始终保持动作的简洁性。你可以先把手头最简单的任务写成操作手册，就像给新手一个接球指南，然后慢慢把更复杂的任务也标准化。

记住，这不是一场要赢的比赛，而是一个持续优化的过程。每次你觉得自己掌握了节奏，新的球就会出现，这很正常。就像健身一样，你永远不会"完成"训练，只会不断适应新的挑战。所以，别给自己太大压力，把每次"掉球"都当作学习的机会，慢慢你就会发现，即使球再多，你也能优雅地接住它们。

[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.
[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.
[P655] [SPEAKER_00]: The goals, actions, metrics, and execution, and really the execution is the SOP.
[P656] [SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the teaser for next episode or next couple episodes coming up.
[P657] [SPEAKER_00]: That's another episode of the Build Your Business podcast with Matt and Chris Reynolds.
[P658] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, things are going great.
[P659] [SPEAKER_00]: Rankings are awesome.
[P660] [SPEAKER_00]: Would love for you to share this with a friend or family member.
[P661] [SPEAKER_00]: Five-star review or honest review anywhere you listen to your podcast.
[P662] [SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody about it.
[P663] [SPEAKER_00]: Share it on social media.
[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

分析结果：
在这段对话中，我们看到了现代播客文化的一个缩影。表面上看，这是一次普通的节目结束语，但背后却隐藏着更深层的现象。

首先，这种“未完待续”的策略，本质上是一种商业化的内容营销手法。它利用听众的好奇心，制造悬念，为下一期节目做铺垫。这不正是我们被信息消费主义裹挟的写照吗？我们被训练成永远期待“下一集”，却很少停下来思考当前的内容是否真正有价值。

其次，主持人对“五颗星评价”和“社交媒体分享”的强调，暴露了现代内容创作者对数据的过度依赖。我们似乎已经习惯了用点赞、分享、评论来衡量内容的价值，而忽略了真正的深度和意义。这种“数据至上”的思维，是否正在侵蚀我们独立思考的能力？

更讽刺的是，主持人在谈论“目标、行动、指标和执行”时，自己却陷入了一种机械化的执行模式。他们按照既定的“标准操作流程”来结束节目，却似乎忘记了最初做播客的初衷。这不正是现代职场人的写照吗？我们在追求效率和指标的过程中，逐渐失去了对工作的热情和创造力。

最后，那句“things are going great”更像是一种自我安慰，而不是真实的反馈。在追求成功和排名的过程中，我们是否已经失去了对“真正伟大”的定义？我们是否在用表面的繁荣，掩盖内心的空虚？

这段对话提醒我们，在信息爆炸的时代，我们需要保持清醒的头脑。不要被表面的成功迷惑，不要被数据绑架，更不要忘记做事的初衷。真正的价值，不在于有多少人点赞或分享，而在于我们是否创造了有意义的内容，是否影响了真正需要帮助的人。

输入内容：
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.

[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**"创始人信任的演化与任务分配的艺术"**

#### 核心洞察
创始人最初只信任自己的判断，但随着时间推移，会逐渐信任长期员工和高管的判断。关键在于如何在这个过程中，有效地将任务分配出去，同时确保核心的、需要判断的任务仍由自己掌控。

#### 解决步骤
1. **识别核心任务**  
   - 找出那些需要创始人亲自处理的、高度依赖判断的任务（如销售策略的制定）。
   - 这些任务是创始人的“专属领域”，暂时无法完全委派。

2. **清理“杂草”任务**  
   - 识别并委派那些可以标准化、流程化的任务（如编写SOP）。
   - 通过信任的员工来执行这些任务，逐步建立信任机制。

3. **建立信任机制**  
   - 通过委派简单任务，逐步培养对员工的信任。
   - 随着信任的建立，逐步将更多任务委派出去。

4. **系统化与自动化**  
   - 将已委派的任务系统化、自动化，确保其高效运行。
   - 通过工具和流程，减少对创始人时间和精力的占用。

5. **持续优化与迭代**  
   - 定期回顾任务分配情况，确保创始人始终聚焦于最核心的任务。
   - 通过反馈机制，不断优化任务分配和系统化流程。

#### 最终目标
通过这一过程，创始人能够逐步将非核心任务委派出去，同时确保核心任务仍由自己掌控，从而实现高效的时间管理和业务增长。

[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,

[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**“双重身份”的闭环优势**

在这个对话中，最核心的洞察是**“双重身份”带来的闭环优势**。Barbell Logic 的创始人既是软件开发者，又是实际使用软件的教练。这种双重身份让他们能够**直接体验产品的痛点**，并迅速优化系统。这种模式不仅解决了传统 B2B 公司“隔靴搔痒”的问题，还创造了一个**自我强化的反馈循环**。

### 关键点：
1. **真实场景测试**：Barbell Logic 将在线教练业务作为新功能的“alpha 测试场”，确保产品在实际使用中不断迭代优化。
2. **深度客户理解**：作为教练和客户的双重身份，让他们能够从两个角度全面理解需求，避免“纸上谈兵”。
3. **快速问题解决**：通过手动介入客户的具体问题，他们不仅能提供超预期的客户服务，还能迅速找到自动化解决方案。
4. **竞争优势**：这种模式形成了天然的“护城河”，因为大多数科技公司无法同时扮演开发者和使用者的角色。

### 启示：
如果你无法像 Barbell Logic 一样拥有双重身份，可以通过以下方式接近这种闭环优势：
- **深度客户接触**：定期与客户面对面交流，甚至亲自体验他们的工作流程。
- **手动介入问题**：当客户反馈问题时，主动接手并手动解决，直到找到自动化方案。
- **建立反馈机制**：设计一个高效的反馈收集和分析系统，确保客户的声音能快速转化为产品改进。

[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.

[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think

[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **CEO角色** ≈ 设定质量标准
2. **创始人角色** ≈ CEO + 技术专家
3. **系统崩溃** ≈ 创始人成为瓶颈
4. **管理书籍** ≈ 解决系统问题

1. CEO的主要职责是设定公司的质量标准 → 创始人作为CEO需要承担这一责任。
2. 创始人在初期是技术专家，但随着公司发展，可能成为瓶颈 → 系统开始崩溃。
3. 系统崩溃导致混乱和紧迫感 → 需要引入管理书籍和系统来解决。
4. 管理书籍（如《E-Myth》、《High Output Management》）提供解决方案 → 帮助创始人购买时间，专注于重要事项。

### 知识精髓提炼
创始人作为CEO需要设定质量标准，但随着公司发展，可能成为瓶颈，导致系统崩溃。通过引入管理书籍和系统，可以解决这一问题，购买时间，专注于重要事项。

主题：系统与流程的文档化与员工培训 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.

[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.

分析结果：
### 简化视角：**"先手动，后自动"的进化法则**

#### 核心洞察
1. **手动验证是自动化的基石**  
   - 在自动化之前，先通过手动操作验证流程的有效性。  
   - 确保每一步都符合预期，避免自动化错误流程。  

2. **小步迭代，持续优化**  
   - SOP（标准操作流程）是动态的，需要根据客户需求和技术变化不断调整。  
   - 每次只做5%的改进，避免大规模重构带来的资源浪费。  

3. **从客户视角出发**  
   - 解决问题时，始终以客户体验为核心。  
   - 确保手动流程能真正满足客户需求，再考虑自动化。  

4. **避免“自动化陷阱”**  
   - 自动化不是目标，而是手段。  
   - 过早自动化可能导致更大的资源浪费，尤其是当流程本身不完善时。  

#### 解决步骤
1. **手动测试**  
   - 先用最基础的方式解决问题，确保流程可行。  
   - 收集反馈，验证效果。  

2. **小范围优化**  
   - 根据反馈，对流程进行微调，每次只改进一小部分。  

3. **逐步自动化**  
   - 当手动流程被证明有效后，再投入资源进行自动化。  

4. **持续迭代**  
   - 定期回顾SOP，根据客户需求和市场变化进行小幅度调整。  

#### 关键提醒
- **不要为了自动化而自动化**：自动化是为了提高效率，而不是为了“看起来很酷”。  
- **客户体验优先**：无论是手动还是自动化，最终目标都是为客户创造价值。  
- **小步快跑**：持续的小改进比一次性的大变革更可持续。  

通过这种“先手动，后自动”的进化法则，你可以避免资源浪费，同时确保流程始终与客户需求保持一致。

输入内容：
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,

[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.

输入内容：
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.

[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.

[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.

[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.

[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.

分析结果：
### 核心洞察：**80%法则**

在团队建设和任务分配中，追求完美往往会导致失败。相反，寻找那些能够达到你能力80%的人，才是更实际和高效的做法。这不仅适用于初创公司，也适用于大型企业。通过将任务交给那些热爱并擅长的人，你可以专注于自己最擅长的领域，同时确保公司各个关键岗位都有合适的人选。

### 具体步骤：

1. **识别核心任务**：
   - 列出公司中所有关键任务和流程。
   - 确定哪些任务是你擅长且热爱的，哪些是你不太感兴趣或不擅长的。

2. **寻找80%人才**：
   - 针对每个任务，寻找那些能够达到你能力80%的人。
   - 关注他们的潜力和热情，而不仅仅是当前的能力。

3. **建立标准操作流程（SOP）**：
   - 为每个任务制定详细的SOP，确保即使你不在，任务也能顺利进行。
   - 定期更新和优化SOP，以适应公司的发展。

4. **灵活应对特殊情况**：
   - 在关键时刻，如IPO或重大项目，可能需要你暂时回到某个具体岗位。
   - 这并不意味着失败，而是确保公司顺利过渡的必要步骤。

5. **持续培训和发展**：
   - 定期评估团队成员的表现，提供培训和发展机会。
   - 确保他们能够不断提升，接近或达到80%的标准。

### 最终建议：

不要追求完美，寻找那些能够达到你能力80%的人，并将任务交给他们。通过建立清晰的SOP和持续培训，你可以确保公司各个关键岗位都有合适的人选，同时专注于自己最擅长的领域。这不仅提高了公司的整体效率，也让你能够更好地应对未来的挑战。

[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.

[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.
[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.

[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.

分析结果：
核心变量提取：
1. 创始人信任度 ≈ 初始自我信任 → 逐步信任他人
2. 任务分类 = 判断导向任务 + 可委托任务
3. 流程优化 = 观察 + 识别低效点 → 制定标准操作程序 (SOP) → 自动化
4. 目标聚焦 = 去除无关任务 (pull the weeds) → 专注核心任务 → 系统化 → 委托

逻辑链条构建：
创始人初始阶段 → 只信任自己判断 → 需要亲自处理关键任务 → 同时识别可委托任务 → 制定SOP → 逐步建立对团队的信任 → 将可委托任务系统化并移交 → 持续优化流程 → 专注新的核心任务

知识精髓提炼：
创始人成长路径 = 自我信任 ÷ 任务分类 * 流程优化 + 目标聚焦 → 逐步建立高效组织体系

关键洞察：
创始人需要经历从亲力亲为到系统化管理的转变，通过不断识别、优化和委托任务，实现组织效率的提升和个人专注点的转移。这个过程需要平衡自我判断和团队信任，同时保持对核心任务的持续关注和优化。

主题：播客结束与下期预告 - doubt

输入内容：
[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.
[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.
[P655] [SPEAKER_00]: The goals, actions, metrics, and execution, and really the execution is the SOP.
[P656] [SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the teaser for next episode or next couple episodes coming up.
[P657] [SPEAKER_00]: That's another episode of the Build Your Business podcast with Matt and Chris Reynolds.
[P658] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, things are going great.
[P659] [SPEAKER_00]: Rankings are awesome.
[P660] [SPEAKER_00]: Would love for you to share this with a friend or family member.
[P661] [SPEAKER_00]: Five-star review or honest review anywhere you listen to your podcast.
[P662] [SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody about it.
[P663] [SPEAKER_00]: Share it on social media.
[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来解构这段对话：

1. **澄清定义**：这里提到的"SOP"（标准操作流程）具体指什么？在商业运营中，SOP的范围和深度如何界定？

2. **概念溯源**：将"goals, actions, metrics, and execution"作为商业计划的框架，这种思维模式源自何处？它是否适用于所有类型的商业？

3. **解构假设**：对话中暗示"things are going great"和"rankings are awesome"，但缺乏具体数据支撑。这些评价是基于什么标准？是否存在确认偏误？

4. **辩证分析**：要求听众"share this with a friend or family member"和"five-star review"是否构成一种道德绑架？这种推广方式的有效性如何？

5. **刷新表述**：通过系统性怀疑，我们可以提出更严谨的播客结束语：在分享具体数据和案例的基础上，邀请听众基于真实体验进行反馈，而不是简单的五星评价要求。同时，明确SOP的具体内容和实施效果，为下期节目奠定更扎实的基础。

这种分析不仅质疑了表面陈述，还为播客内容的改进提供了建设性建议。

[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think

[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这段话的本质。

1. 演化分析：这段话反映了企业管理思想的演进，从个人主导到系统化管理的转变。最初创业者往往事必躬亲，但随着企业发展，需要建立系统来解放创始人的时间。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于创始人个人能力与组织发展需求之间的矛盾。创始人既是企业最核心的驱动力，又可能成为企业发展的瓶颈。

3. 存在理由：这种讨论存在的原因是帮助创业者理解从个人英雄主义到系统化管理的必要转变，以实现企业的可持续发展。

4. 本质还原：褪去具体案例和书籍推荐，这段话的核心本质在于探讨企业从个人驱动到系统驱动的转型过程。

5. 属和种差：这段话属于企业管理理论，其特殊之处在于聚焦创始人角色转变这一关键节点，强调系统建设的重要性。

本质定义：这段话揭示了企业从个人驱动到系统驱动的转型本质，强调了创始人角色转变和系统建设的重要性，这是企业可持续发展的关键所在。

输入内容：
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.

[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。一个公司的解构，其本质是什么？

1. **演化分析**：从组织演化的角度来看，公司最初建立时往往有明确的流程和职责分配。随着时间推移，这些流程可能因缺乏文档和清晰性而逐渐模糊，导致关键信息集中在少数人手中。

2. **矛盾分析**：这里的主要矛盾在于**信息共享与信息垄断**。标准操作程序（SOP）的设计初衷是为了确保知识的传递和流程的标准化，但当某些个体选择垄断信息时，这一初衷被颠覆，导致组织脆弱性增加。

3. **存在理由**：SOP的存在是为了确保组织在人员流动时仍能正常运作。然而，当个体将信息作为权力工具时，SOP的存在理由被削弱，甚至成为组织的潜在威胁。

4. **本质还原**：褪去表象，公司解构的本质在于**信任与责任的失衡**。当员工无法真正拥有责任，或当信息被用作控制手段时，组织的核心价值被侵蚀，最终导致功能失调。

5. **属和种差**：公司解构（属）是一种组织功能逐渐失效的过程，其种差在于**信息垄断与责任缺失**，导致关键流程无法持续运行。

因此，公司解构的本质是**信任的崩塌与责任的分散**，最终使得组织无法维持其核心功能。

主题：客户生命周期与系统应用 - essence

输入内容：
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.

[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段对话涉及的核心概念是"系统化运营管理"。从演化角度来看，这是企业从初创期向成熟期过渡时必然出现的需求，源于规模扩大带来的复杂性。其内在矛盾在于标准化与灵活性的对立：既要建立统一流程，又要适应不同客户需求。从存在主义视角，系统化运营存在的理由是为了在规模扩张中保持效率与质量。通过现象学还原，其本质是建立可重复、可优化的流程体系。因此，系统化运营管理可定义为：企业为应对规模扩张而建立的标准化流程体系，旨在通过可重复的操作流程提高效率，同时保持适应不同需求的灵活性。

[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考系统和标准操作程序(SOP)的本质。

从演化角度来看，系统和SOP源于人类对效率和可重复性的追求。在原始社会，人类就开始通过经验积累和知识传递来提高生存效率。随着社会分工的细化，这种经验逐渐系统化，形成了早期的操作规范。

通过矛盾分析法，我们可以发现系统和SOP的主要矛盾在于标准化与灵活性的对立。过于僵化的系统会限制创新，而过于灵活又难以保证一致性。这一矛盾推动了系统设计的不断优化。

从存在主义的角度，系统和SOP的存在源于人类对确定性和控制的需求。在复杂多变的环境中，系统提供了一种可预测的框架，帮助人们应对不确定性。

通过现象学还原，我们可以褪去系统和SOP的具体表现形式，发现其本质是一种知识编码和传递的机制。它将经验、技能和最佳实践转化为可重复的步骤，从而实现知识的积累和传承。

因此，我们可以这样定义：系统或标准操作程序是一种将复杂过程分解为可重复步骤的知识编码机制，旨在提高效率、确保一致性和实现知识的可传递性。其属是知识管理工具，种差在于其结构化、可重复性和可操作性特征。

[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.

[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

输入内容：
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.

[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这段对话的本质。通过现象学还原，我们可以发现对话的核心围绕着"信任"与"授权"这对主要矛盾展开。从演化角度看，这反映了组织从创始人单打独斗到建立系统化运作的必经过程。存在主义分析显示，这一过程源于创始人对自我判断的信任逐渐扩展到对他人的信任。最终，我们可以将其定义为：一个组织从个人化运作向系统化运作的转型过程，其本质是信任的扩展与制度化的建立。这个过程的核心在于创始人如何将个人判断转化为可复制的系统，同时保持对关键决策的控制。

[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.

[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.

[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.

[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段话探讨的核心问题是：在个人与企业的成长过程中，任务管理与系统化运作的本质是什么？

通过演化分析，我们可以看到，从个人创业到企业规模化，任务管理经历了从简单到复杂的演变。然而，这种演变并非线性增长，而是螺旋式上升。每个阶段都会面临相似的挑战，只是规模和复杂性不同。

矛盾分析揭示了这一过程中的主要矛盾：个人能力与组织需求之间的矛盾。创业者需要在创新与系统化之间找到平衡，既要保持创造性思维，又要建立可复制的运作机制。

从存在主义的角度看，任务管理的存在理由在于实现个人价值与组织目标的统一。它不仅是效率工具，更是实现自我与组织共同成长的载体。

通过现象学还原，我们可以褪去表象，看到任务管理的本质：它是一种将个人能力转化为组织能力的机制，是连接个体创造性与组织效率的桥梁。

因此，任务管理的本质定义是：一种将个人能力系统化、可复制化的组织机制，旨在实现个体与组织的协同发展，其核心在于平衡创新与效率，实现从个人价值到组织价值的转化。

[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.

[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.

[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,

[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段对话揭示了一个企业运营系统的本质。

1. 演化分析：从最初创始人独自编写系统，到逐步建立分工明确的SOP体系，体现了组织从个人化到系统化的演进过程。这种演进源于对效率和规模化的需求。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾体现在标准化与个性化之间。企业需要建立统一的操作流程，同时又要保持对客户需求的灵活响应。这种矛盾推动着系统的不断优化。

3. 存在理由：SOP的存在是为了确保企业运营的稳定性和可复制性。它源于对效率、质量和可扩展性的追求，是企业从个人化走向组织化的必然产物。

4. 本质还原：褪去具体行业和岗位的表象，SOP的本质是一种知识管理和经验传承的机制。它将个人智慧转化为组织能力，使企业不依赖于特定个体而持续运转。

5. 属和种差：SOP属于组织管理工具的范畴，其种差在于它通过标准化流程来确保运营的一致性和效率，同时为持续改进提供基础。

因此，SOP的本质是一种将个人经验转化为组织能力的系统化工具，它通过标准化流程确保运营效率，同时为持续改进提供基础。这种工具的存在源于组织对效率、质量和可扩展性的追求，是个人化企业走向组织化运营的必然产物。

[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.

[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.

分析结果：
就像园丁在花园中，先拔除杂草，才能让花朵茁壮成长。创始人需要先处理那些简单重复的任务，才能专注于需要判断和创新的核心工作。信任他人就像培育幼苗，需要时间和耐心，直到它们长成可以依靠的大树。

输入内容：
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.

[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.
[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。标准操作程序（SOP）的本质是什么？

1. 演化分析：从最初的手写文档到现代的视频记录，SOP的载体形式在不断演进，但其核心目的始终未变 - 确保操作的一致性和可重复性。

2. 矛盾分析：SOP的主要矛盾在于标准化与灵活性之间的平衡。过于僵化的SOP可能限制创新，而过于灵活的SOP则可能失去其规范作用。

3. 存在理由：SOP存在的根本原因在于人类认知的局限性和组织规模化的需求。它通过将隐性知识显性化，实现知识的传承和效率的提升。

4. 本质还原：褪去具体形式（文档、视频等），SOP的本质是一种知识传递和流程优化的工具，其核心在于将最佳实践固化为可执行的步骤。

5. 属和种差：SOP属于组织管理工具的一种，其区别于其他管理工具的特征在于其具体性、可操作性和可重复性。

因此，SOP的本质是一种将最佳实践固化为可重复执行步骤的组织管理工具，其核心价值在于确保操作的一致性和知识的有效传承。

[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.

[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
就像一座桥梁，若只有一根支柱支撑，一旦支柱倒塌，整个桥梁就会坍塌。公司中的关键人物若独揽知识，不与他人分享，便如同那根孤立的支柱，一旦离开，公司的运作便会陷入瘫痪。因此，建立标准操作程序（SOP）并确保其透明和共享，就像为桥梁增加多根支柱，使其更加稳固和可靠。通过定期的沟通和反馈，确保每个人都能理解和执行这些程序，就像定期检查和维护桥梁，确保其安全无虞。最终，赋予员工真正的所有权，让他们感到自己是公司的一部分，就像让每根支柱都承担起支撑桥梁的责任，共同确保桥梁的稳固和长久。

主题：系统与标准操作流程的重要性 - analogy

输入内容：
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

分析结果：
就像建造一座房子，标准操作程序（SOP）是建筑蓝图，指导每一步的施工。没有蓝图，房子可能歪斜甚至倒塌；有了蓝图，即使新手也能按图索骥，建造出稳固的房屋。在商业中，SOP就是这样的蓝图，让每个员工都能按部就班地完成任务，确保企业的稳定和高效运作。

[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,

[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.

分析结果：
就像一支交响乐团，每个乐手都有自己的乐谱，但指挥家确保所有部分和谐统一。在这里，CEO是总指挥，CMO是首席小提琴手，CXO是低音提琴手，各自负责不同的乐章，但共同创造出一首完美的商业交响曲。

[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.

[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.

[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.

[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.
[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

分析结果：
就像在厨房里，你一边做菜一边录下整个过程，然后把这个视频交给助手，让他们根据视频整理出一份菜谱。你不需要手写每一个步骤，而是让助手通过观看视频，提取出关键步骤，最终形成一份标准的操作指南。这样，你不仅节省了时间，还能确保每个细节都被记录下来，就像把烹饪的艺术转化为精确的科学。

[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.

[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个问题。这段对话揭示了几个关键的本质：

1. 判断力的本质：判断力并非简单的决策能力，而是建立在深刻理解和责任感基础上的综合能力。它要求个体能够超越表面任务，把握问题的核心。

2. 自动化与手动操作的关系：自动化并非目的，而是手段。真正的本质在于找到正确的流程和方法，然后才考虑如何用技术来优化和扩展。

3. 标准化操作程序(SOP)的本质：SOP不是一成不变的规则，而是随着环境和需求变化而不断进化的有机体。它的本质在于适应性和可迭代性。

4. 客户服务的本质：真正的客户服务不是完成既定任务，而是站在客户角度思考问题，找到根本解决方案。这需要思维模式的根本转变。

5. 创新的本质：创新不是一蹴而就的巨变，而是通过持续的小幅改进逐步实现的。这种渐进式变革的本质在于其可持续性和可控性。

这些本质揭示了企业管理中的深层规律：成功的关键不在于追求表面的效率或技术，而在于对核心问题的深刻理解，对流程的持续优化，以及对变化的灵活适应。

[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.

[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这段话的本质。这段话探讨了企业管理和人才分配的核心问题。

从演化角度看，这段话反映了从个人创业到团队管理的必然转变。最初创业者可能亲力亲为，但随着企业发展，必须学会授权和分工。

主要矛盾在于：个人能力的有限性与企业发展需求的无限性之间的矛盾。创业者需要认识到自己并非全才，必须将不擅长的领域交给更专业的人。

从存在主义角度，这段话揭示了企业存在的本质：通过团队协作实现个人无法完成的目标。每个成员的存在价值在于填补他人的不足。

褪去表象，这段话的本质在于：成功的企业管理建立在正确认识自我、合理分配任务的基础上。关键在于找到能够达到80%标准的人才，并接受这种不完美。

因此，这段话的本质可以定义为：一种基于自我认知和人才匹配的企业管理方法论，强调合理授权和团队协作的重要性，以80%标准作为人才选拔的基准。

[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think

[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

在现代创业环境中，许多创始人往往陷入一种自我中心的工作模式。他们相信自己是最有能力的人，认为公司的成功完全依赖于个人的努力和标准。这种心态在初期可能有效，但随着公司的发展，创始人往往会成为瓶颈，导致系统崩溃和混乱。

### 个体剖析

创始人最初可能是公司中最有能力的人，但随着公司规模的扩大，这种个人英雄主义的管理方式会逐渐失效。创始人开始错过会议，成为工作流程中的瓶颈，最终导致公司陷入混乱。这种混乱不仅仅是工作量的增加，更是管理方式的失败。创始人需要意识到，他们的角色不仅仅是执行者，更是系统的设计者和维护者。

### 群体透视

从更广泛的社会视角来看，这种现象反映了现代创业文化中的一种普遍问题：过度依赖个人能力而忽视系统建设。许多创始人在创业初期过于自信，认为只有自己才能确保公司的成功。然而，随着公司的发展，这种个人英雄主义的管理方式往往会导致系统崩溃和效率低下。这种现象不仅影响了个别公司的发展，也反映了整个创业生态系统中对系统建设和管理的忽视。

### 思考整合

创始人需要从个人英雄主义的管理方式转向系统化的管理思维。通过建立有效的系统和标准操作流程（SOPs），创始人可以逐步减少对个人能力的依赖，提高公司的整体效率和稳定性。这不仅有助于公司的发展，也能让创始人从繁重的工作中解放出来，专注于真正重要的战略决策。正如一些管理书籍所强调的，系统化的管理是公司长期成功的关键。创始人需要意识到，他们的角色不仅仅是执行者，更是系统的设计者和维护者。通过建立有效的系统和标准操作流程，创始人可以逐步减少对个人能力的依赖，提高公司的整体效率和稳定性。这不仅有助于公司的发展，也能让创始人从繁重的工作中解放出来，专注于真正重要的战略决策。

[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.

[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.

分析结果：
就像种一棵树，你得先确保种子能发芽，再想着怎么让它长成参天大树。自动化之前，手动验证每个步骤，就像园丁每天观察幼苗，确保它健康生长。随着时间的推移，你只需微调，就像修剪枝叶，让树形更完美。这个过程虽慢，但每一步都扎实，最终收获的是一片郁郁葱葱的森林。

[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.

[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话背后的本质。表面上，这是一个关于企业管理和客户生命周期的讨论，但如果我们剥开这层表象，会发现更深层次的问题。

首先，这位CEO提到要"开始"和"给予自己宽容"。这听起来很积极，但实际上暴露了现代企业管理中的一个普遍问题：我们总是忙于制定计划、建立系统，却很少真正停下来思考这些系统和流程是否真的必要。我们是否陷入了"为了系统而系统"的怪圈？

其次，他详细描述了客户生命周期的各个环节，从营销到销售再到售后服务。这看似是标准的商业操作，但仔细想想，这不正是现代商业把人异化的体现吗？我们把客户简化为一个个可以量化的"接触点"，用"转化率"来衡量人的价值。我们真的在服务客户，还是在服务数据？

再者，他提到要回到销售一线，这看似是领导者的亲力亲为，但换个角度看，这是否暴露了企业过度依赖个人的问题？一个真正成熟的企业，难道不应该建立起不依赖任何个人的系统吗？

最后，他谈到要"拔除杂草"，停止做不该做的事。这听起来很明智，但谁来决定什么是"杂草"？在追求效率的过程中，我们是否正在失去企业最宝贵的创造力和灵活性？

这些思考让我们不得不问：现代企业管理是否已经陷入了一种自我复制的怪圈？我们建立系统是为了服务人，还是人已经成为了系统的奴隶？在追求效率和规模的过程中，我们是否正在失去企业最初存在的意义？

这不仅仅是一个企业管理的问题，它反映了整个现代社会的一种困境：在追求效率和规模的过程中，我们是否正在失去作为人的本质？我们是否正在把自己和他人都简化为可以被量化的数据点？这些问题值得我们每个人深思。

[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.

[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.

分析结果：
就像一支交响乐团，每个乐手都有自己擅长的乐器。指挥家不必精通每一种乐器，而是找到最擅长的小提琴手、最出色的长笛演奏者，让他们各司其职。有时指挥家也需要暂时放下指挥棒，亲自演奏一段关键旋律，但最终还是要让专业乐手们将乐章演绎到极致。80%的完美已经足够让整支乐团奏出动人的交响曲。

[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.

[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.
[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

分析结果：
### 现状分析
在当今的职场环境中，标准操作程序（SOPs）的创建方式已经从传统的文档编写转向了视频记录。随着技术的发展，像Loom这样的工具使得通过视频记录和屏幕共享来创建SOPs变得更加便捷。这种转变不仅提高了效率，还使得知识的传递更加直观和易于理解。

### 个体剖析
对于个体而言，这种转变意味着他们可以在执行任务的同时，通过录制视频来记录整个过程。这种方式不仅节省了时间，还使得知识的传递更加自然。个体在完成任务时，脑海中已经在思考每一步骤，而通过视频记录，这些步骤可以被清晰地展示出来，便于他人理解和学习。

### 群体透视
从群体的角度来看，这种转变反映了技术对工作方式的深刻影响。随着远程工作和数字化办公的普及，视频记录和屏幕共享成为了知识传递的重要工具。然而，这也带来了新的挑战，如如何确保视频内容的准确性和完整性，以及如何有效地将视频转化为标准化的操作步骤。

### 思考整合
总的来说，技术改变了我们创建和传递SOPs的方式。视频记录不仅提高了效率，还使得知识的传递更加直观。然而，这也要求我们在使用这些工具时，更加注重内容的准确性和标准化。通过结合视频记录和AI技术，我们可以更高效地创建和优化SOPs，从而提升整体的工作效率和质量。

**核心洞察**：技术的进步使得SOPs的创建和传递更加高效和直观，但同时也要求我们在使用这些工具时，更加注重内容的准确性和标准化。

[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.

[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话中揭示的创业者的困境与成长。表面上看，这不过是关于如何分配任务、建立流程的讨论，但背后却隐藏着更深层的矛盾与人性挣扎。

首先，创业者最初的困境是信任危机。他们只相信自己的判断，这种偏执既是优势也是枷锁。就像对话中说的，“最初，地球上只有一个人的判断你信任——那就是你自己。”这种自我中心主义在创业初期或许是必要的，但长期来看却会成为发展的瓶颈。有趣的是，这种不信任往往披着“责任”的外衣，创业者用“只有我能做好”来合理化自己的控制欲。

其次，我们看到了创业者与系统之间的永恒博弈。他们一方面渴望建立自动化的系统，另一方面又害怕失去对核心业务的控制。这种矛盾心理在对话中表现得淋漓尽致：“你的目标是将其系统化并移交，但你可能需要先做一段时间。”这就像一个人既想放手，又害怕放手后的失控。

更值得玩味的是，创业者对“重要事务”的定义往往带有强烈的主观色彩。他们用“判断导向的任务”来合理化自己的选择，但谁又能说清楚哪些任务真正需要创始人亲力亲为？这种自我重要感的幻觉，常常让创业者陷入忙碌的假象中。

最后，我们看到了创业者身份认同的困境。他们热爱解决问题，享受创业的过程，但这种热爱也可能成为发展的障碍。正如对话中所说：“这不是为了把所有事情都从清单上卸下，然后退休享受。”这种对工作的执着，既是动力，也可能是枷锁，让创业者难以真正放手。

这些困境折射出创业者群体的深层矛盾：在控制与放手之间摇摆，在自我重要感与团队协作之间挣扎，在热爱工作与企业发展之间寻找平衡。或许，真正的成长不在于如何更好地控制，而在于学会如何优雅地放手。

[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.

[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下公司内部的知识垄断现象。表面上，这似乎是一个简单的管理问题，但背后隐藏着更深层的人性和组织文化矛盾。

**现状分析**：在现代企业中，标准操作流程（SOP）本应是共享知识的基础。然而，现实往往截然相反。我们看到，某些员工会刻意隐藏关键信息，将自己塑造成不可替代的“关键人物”。这种行为就像癌细胞一样，在组织中悄然扩散，最终可能导致整个系统的瘫痪。

**个体剖析**：那些囤积信息的员工，他们的动机是什么？表面上看是为了保住饭碗，但更深层次，这是一种对安全感的病态追求。他们害怕失去价值，害怕被取代，于是选择了最愚蠢的方式——制造信息壁垒。这种行为暴露了他们的不自信，也反映了组织文化中的信任缺失。

**群体透视**：从组织层面来看，这种现象暴露了现代企业的致命弱点。我们过分依赖个体，却忽视了系统的力量。一个健康的组织应该像蜂群一样，每个个体都是可替代的，但整体却能高效运转。然而，我们却常常陷入“关键人物”陷阱，把组织的命运系于少数人身上。

**思考整合**：真正的问题不在于那些囤积信息的员工，而在于我们构建的组织文化。我们创造了鼓励个人英雄主义的环境，却忽视了集体智慧的力量。我们强调“ownership”，却忽视了“shared responsibility”。我们追求效率，却忽视了韧性。

最后，让我们用一个尖锐的问题结束：如果一个组织的生存依赖于少数人的知识垄断，那么这个组织真的值得存在吗？也许，真正的创新不在于创造不可替代的个体，而在于构建一个即使失去任何个体也能持续运转的系统。这才是现代企业应该追求的目标。

[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.

[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.

分析结果：
### 现状分析
在创业初期，创始人往往身兼数职，从战略规划到日常运营，事无巨细都要亲力亲为。随着公司发展，任务量激增，创始人开始意识到需要将部分工作委派出去。然而，这个过程并不简单，尤其是当涉及到复杂的技术创新或高层管理时。创始人常常陷入“我能做得更好”的思维陷阱，导致任务积压，甚至错过重要会议。

### 个体剖析
创始人之所以难以放手，深层原因在于对控制的渴望和对失败的恐惧。他们担心委派出去的任务无法达到自己的标准，害怕失去对公司的掌控。这种心理在技术型创始人中尤为明显，因为他们往往对自己的创新解决方案有着近乎偏执的追求。然而，这种“全能型”思维恰恰限制了公司的成长。创始人需要认识到，委派不是放弃，而是为了让公司走得更远。

### 群体透视
从更宏观的角度看，创始人面临的委派困境反映了现代企业管理的普遍矛盾：个人能力与组织发展的冲突。在快速变化的市场环境中，企业需要不断适应新的挑战，而创始人个人的时间和精力是有限的。委派不仅是管理技巧，更是组织进化的必然要求。那些成功的企业，如亚马逊、谷歌，之所以能够持续创新，正是因为它们建立了一套高效的任务分配和反馈机制。

### 思考整合
创始人需要从“全能战士”转变为“系统设计师”。委派不是一劳永逸的解决方案，而是一个持续优化的过程。每一次公司规模的扩大，都会带来新的委派挑战。创始人应该将委派视为一种能力，而不是负担。通过建立清晰的系统和标准操作流程（SOP），创始人可以确保任务在委派后依然按照预期执行。最终，委派不仅是解放创始人的时间，更是为公司的长远发展奠定基础。

**金句**：委派不是放弃控制，而是为了让公司走得更远。创始人最大的挑战，不是如何做更多，而是如何让别人做得更好。

[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,

[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.

分析结果：
这段对话揭示了现代企业运营中的一个核心悖论：我们痴迷于系统和流程的完美，却往往忽视了这些系统背后的真正目的——服务人。让我们深入思考一下：

1. **现状分析**：
   这些高管们花了大量时间制定SOP（标准操作流程），从客户信用卡处理到教练技术分析，事无巨细。他们自豪于"吃自己的狗粮"，即自己使用自己开发的产品。表面上看，这似乎是一种完美的闭环。

2. **个体剖析**：
   但仔细想想，这种对系统的痴迷是否正在扼杀企业的灵魂？当CEO需要向CMO汇报时，当每个环节都被严格定义时，我们是否正在创造一个机械化的组织？这些高管们沉浸在制定流程的快感中，却可能忽视了最本质的东西——人性化的服务。

3. **群体透视**：
   这种现象反映了现代企业的一个普遍困境：我们过于依赖系统和流程，以至于忘记了商业的本质是人与人之间的互动。当所有事情都被标准化，当每个动作都被预先定义，我们是否正在创造一个缺乏灵活性和创造力的组织？这种"完美系统"的追求，是否正在将企业变成一台冰冷的机器？

4. **思考整合**：
   真正的商业智慧不在于制定完美的流程，而在于在系统和人性之间找到平衡。过度依赖SOP可能会让我们失去对客户真实需求的敏感度。企业应该记住，再完美的系统也只是工具，真正的价值在于如何用这些工具为人们创造更好的体验。在追求效率的同时，我们更需要保持对人性的洞察和关怀。

"吃自己的狗粮"固然重要，但更重要的是记住：我们不是为系统服务，系统是为我们服务的。在制定每一个流程时，我们都应该问自己：这真的能让我们的客户和员工的生活变得更好吗？还是仅仅为了满足我们对"完美系统"的执念？

[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

分析结果：
让我们来深挖一下这个所谓的“系统”和“标准操作流程”（SOP）的玩意儿。表面上，它们被吹捧为企业的救世主，仿佛只要有了这些，企业就能自动运转，老板们就能躺平数钱。但事实真的如此吗？

首先，我们得承认，SOP确实有其价值。它像是一本烹饪书，告诉你每一步该怎么做，直到你烤出一个完美的派。但问题在于，生活不是烤派，企业也不是IKEA家具。那些看似简单的步骤，在实际操作中往往会遇到各种意外和变数。你以为按照手册就能组装出一个完美的书架，结果发现少了个螺丝，或者说明书根本就是错的。

再来看看那些创业者，他们往往有一种“超人”心态，觉得自己无所不能，能搞定一切。这种心态在初期是必要的，因为创业本身就是一场冒险。但随着时间的推移，如果他们还坚持这种心态，就会发现自己被淹没在日常琐事中，无法真正推动企业的发展。这时候，SOP就成了他们的救命稻草。但问题是，SOP真的能解决所有问题吗？

我们不得不怀疑，SOP是否真的能替代人的判断力和创造力。那些复杂的、需要灵活应对的任务，真的能通过一个简单的清单来解决吗？还是说，SOP只是给了我们一种虚假的安全感，让我们误以为一切都在掌控之中？

更深入一点，SOP的背后其实隐藏着一种控制欲。老板们希望通过SOP来规范员工的行为，确保一切都按照他们的意愿进行。但员工是人，不是机器。他们有自己的想法和创造力，SOP可能会扼杀这些宝贵的品质，让企业变成一个机械化的流水线。

最后，我们还得思考，SOP是否真的能帮助企业实现长期增长。那些依赖SOP的企业，是否会在面对市场变化时显得僵化和迟钝？真正的创新和突破，往往来自于那些敢于打破规则、跳出框架的人，而不是那些严格按照SOP行事的“好员工”。

所以，SOP确实有其价值，但它绝不是万能的。真正的挑战在于，如何在规范与灵活之间找到平衡，如何在确保效率的同时，保留人的创造力和判断力。这才是每个企业真正需要思考的问题。

[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.

[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.

分析结果：
### 现状分析
在现代商业环境中，自动化和标准化操作程序（SOPs）被视为提高效率和一致性的关键工具。然而，许多企业在追求自动化的过程中，往往忽视了手动验证的重要性。他们急于将流程自动化，却忽略了确保流程本身的有效性和客户体验的优化。

### 个体剖析
对于企业中的个体，尤其是低级别员工，他们往往将新任务视为额外负担，而非提升客户体验的机会。这种心态源于对自身角色和责任的狭隘理解，以及对客户需求缺乏深入洞察。企业高管在推动这些变革时，必须确保员工不仅理解任务的重要性，还能从中获得激励和成就感。

### 群体透视
从更广泛的社会视角来看，自动化和标准化操作程序的实施反映了现代企业对效率和规模化的追求。然而，这种追求往往伴随着对灵活性和创新性的牺牲。企业在自动化过程中，必须不断适应技术变化和客户需求的变化，确保SOPs能够持续演进，而不是成为僵化的束缚。

### 思考整合
自动化和标准化操作程序的实施，本质上是对企业流程和客户体验的深度优化。然而，这一过程必须建立在手动验证和持续迭代的基础上。企业不应盲目追求自动化，而应确保每个流程都经过充分验证，能够真正满足客户需求。同时，SOPs应被视为动态的、不断演进的文件，而非一成不变的规则。只有这样，企业才能在追求效率的同时，保持灵活性和创新性，真正实现长期的成功。

**核心洞察**：自动化不是目的，而是手段。真正的成功在于通过手动验证和持续迭代，确保每个流程都能为客户创造价值。SOPs应被视为动态的工具，而非僵化的规则，企业必须在效率和灵活性之间找到平衡。

主题：创始人角色与系统移交 - doubt

输入内容：
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think

[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.

分析结果：
这段对话中包含了几个值得深入探讨的核心观点。让我们用休谟的怀疑之锥来解构这些观点：

1. **CEO角色定位的假设**
   - 对话中提出"CEO的主要职责是设定质量标准"，这个论断值得推敲。是否所有类型的公司都适用这个标准？在不同发展阶段，CEO的角色是否应该有所调整？

2. "最佳执行者"悖论
   - 创始人初期可能是最佳执行者，但随着公司发展，这种定位可能成为瓶颈。这里隐含着一个管理悖论：如何从"最佳执行者"转型为"最佳管理者"？这个转型的关键节点是什么？

3. 管理书籍的适用性
   - 对话中推荐了多本管理书籍，但每本书都有其特定的时代背景和应用场景。这些管理理论在当今快速变化的商业环境中是否仍然完全适用？是否存在"过度理论化"的风险？

4. "系统化"与"个性化"的平衡
   - 对话强调系统化的重要性，但每个企业都有其独特性。如何在建立标准化系统和保持企业特色之间找到平衡点？过度系统化是否会扼杀创新？

5. 时间管理的本质
   - "买回时间"的概念值得深思。时间真的是可以"买回"的资源吗？更深层次的问题可能是：我们是否应该重新定义"效率"的概念，而不是简单地将时间视为可量化的资源？

6. 管理理论的传承与发展
   - 对话中提到的管理理论传承链条（从Andy Grove到John Doerr）引发思考：管理理论是应该遵循传统，还是需要根据新时代的特点进行创新？是否存在"管理理论教条化"的风险？

这些质疑不是为了否定对话中的观点，而是为了通过系统性思考，达到更深层次的理解。真正的管理智慧可能在于在理论与实践之间、传统与创新之间、标准化与个性化之间找到动态平衡。

主题：系统与流程的自动化与维护 - doubt

输入内容：
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.

[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.

分析结果：
这段对话揭示了几个值得深入探讨的核心问题：

1. **信任的转移与授权**
   - 创始人最初只信任自己的判断，这是否意味着创始人的认知局限会影响企业发展？
   - 信任他人判断的过程，是否隐含了对自我判断的重新评估？
   - 授权他人制定SOP，是否可能导致核心价值的稀释？

2. **流程标准化与创新**
   - 将判断导向的任务系统化，是否可能扼杀创新？
   - 在标准化过程中，如何平衡效率与灵活性？
   - "鞋匠的孩子没鞋穿"的现象，是否反映了服务型企业普遍存在的自我忽视问题？

3. **优先级与目标管理**
   - 将目标限制在3个以内，是否过于简化了企业的复杂性？
   - 季节性/年度规划，是否可能导致短期主义？
   - 从转化到激活的过渡，是否揭示了产品与市场匹配度的深层问题？

4. **创始人的角色演变**
   - 创始人回归一线工作，是必要的调整还是管理失败的标志？
   - 持续解决问题的工作热情，是否可能成为企业发展的阻碍？
   - 创始人与职业经理人的角色边界，应该如何界定？

这些问题的本质在于：企业成长过程中，如何在保持核心价值的同时实现规模化？如何在标准化与创新之间找到平衡点？如何在创始人个人特质与组织需求之间达成和谐？这些都需要更深入的思考和探索。

[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.

[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.
[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

分析结果：
让我们深入分析这段关于创建标准操作流程(SOP)的对话：

1. **概念澄清**
   - SOP的本质：将重复性工作流程化、标准化
   - 技术工具：Loom视频、AI转录、文档编辑

2. **历史溯源**
   - 早期SOP创建方式：Google Docs、Microsoft Word等文字处理软件
   - 现代演进：视频记录+AI辅助的混合模式

3. **假设解构**
   - 隐含前提：视频记录比文字描述更直观有效
   - 潜在局限：适用于屏幕操作，不适用于实体操作场景
   - 效率假设：视频记录仅增加1-2%的时间成本

4. **辩证分析**
   - 优势：
     * 实时记录，减少后续整理时间
     * 视频更直观，便于理解
     * AI辅助提升文档生成效率
   - 挑战：
     * 需要明确责任归属
     * 确保变更记录完整
     * 适应不同工作场景

5. **建设性洞见**
   - SOP创建的关键在于：
     1. 选择合适的记录方式（视频/文字）
     2. 明确流程所有权
     3. 建立规范的变更机制
     4. 充分利用技术工具提升效率
   - 最佳实践：
     * 实时记录工作流程
     * 利用AI辅助生成初稿
     * 建立文档更新规范
     * 确保流程可迭代优化

这种混合式SOP创建方法体现了技术赋能下的流程优化，但同时也需要建立相应的管理机制来确保其有效性和可持续性。

主题：客户生命周期与系统应用 - doubt

输入内容：
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.

[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
- **系统（System）**：在企业管理中，系统通常指的是一系列相互关联的流程和步骤，用于实现特定的业务目标。
- **SOP（Standard Operating Procedure）**：标准操作程序，是详细描述如何执行特定任务的文档，以确保一致性和效率。
- **B2C（Business-to-Consumer）**：企业对消费者的商业模式，直接面向个人客户销售产品或服务。
- **B2B（Business-to-Business）**：企业对企业的商业模式，向其他企业销售产品或服务。

### 概念溯源
Barbell Logic公司正在经历快速增长，特别是在B2B领域。这种增长带来了新的挑战，尤其是在系统和SOP的建立上。公司需要为2025年的新项目制定相应的系统和SOP，以确保业务的顺利运行。

### 解构假设
假设1：公司现有的系统和SOP足够支持当前的业务需求。
- 质疑：随着业务的扩展，特别是B2B领域的复杂性增加，现有的系统和SOP可能不足以应对新的挑战。

假设2：CEO亲自参与销售周期是必要的。
- 质疑：虽然CEO的销售能力很强，但长期来看，建立和培训销售团队可能更为有效。

### 辩证分析
**正面观点**：
- CEO亲自参与销售可以迅速提升销售业绩，特别是在新产品或服务的初期阶段。
- 亲自参与销售有助于CEO更好地理解市场需求，从而制定更有效的系统和SOP。

**反面观点**：
- CEO的时间是有限的，过度参与销售可能会影响其在战略制定和团队管理上的投入。
- 长期依赖CEO的销售能力可能导致团队缺乏自主性和创新能力。

### 刷新表述
为了在2025年实现持续增长，Barbell Logic公司需要在以下几个方面进行优化：
1. **系统和SOP的建立**：确保所有新项目都有详细的系统和SOP，以便团队成员能够高效执行任务。
2. **销售团队的培训**：CEO应投入更多时间在销售团队的培训上，而不是亲自参与销售。通过建立完善的销售系统和SOP，提升团队的整体销售能力。
3. **角色调整**：CEO应重新评估自己的角色，专注于战略制定和团队管理，将具体的销售任务交给专业团队。

通过系统性怀疑和辩证分析，我们可以得出结论：虽然CEO的销售能力在短期内对公司有帮助，但长期来看，建立和培训销售团队、完善系统和SOP才是实现持续增长的关键。

[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.

[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.

分析结果：
这段对话揭示了现代企业管理中的一个核心悖论：我们追求专业化分工，却又无法完全摆脱个人英雄主义的诱惑。表面上，这是一套关于授权与标准化的理性论述，实际上却暴露了创始人与CEO们难以言说的焦虑。

让我们深入思考几个关键点：

1. **80%法则的虚伪性**
   所谓的80%标准，不过是创始人们自我安慰的借口。他们渴望完全掌控，却又不得不承认自己的局限。这种妥协式的授权，本质上是一种权力的自我保护机制。

2. **技术天才的困境**
   当CEO们不得不重新扮演技术角色时，这恰恰暴露了现代企业管理的脆弱性。我们建立起的庞大管理体系，在某些关键时刻竟然如此不堪一击。

3. **标准化的幻象**
   标准化操作流程（SOP）被奉为圭臬，但现实告诉我们，真正的商业成功往往依赖于那些无法标准化的"魔法时刻"。这种矛盾揭示了现代管理理论的局限性。

4. **创始人的自我认知**
   对话中反复强调"你不是超人"，这种自我告诫恰恰反映了创始人们内心深处的自我怀疑。他们需要不断说服自己接受现实，这种心理斗争本身就是一种讽刺。

5. **团队构建的悖论**
   我们追求多样化的团队，却又希望每个人都能达到创始人的80%水平。这种期望本身就是对多样性的否定，暴露了现代企业管理中的根本矛盾。

更深层次地看，这种管理思维的背后，是现代商业社会对效率的盲目崇拜。我们建立起了复杂的组织架构，却依然无法摆脱对个人能力的依赖。这种困境不仅仅是管理技术的问题，更是整个商业文明的缩影。

在这个标准化与个性化、效率与创新、理性与直觉不断碰撞的时代，我们是否应该重新思考：真正的商业成功，究竟应该建立在什么样的基础之上？也许，答案不在于寻找完美的管理公式，而在于接受商业世界本身的混沌与不确定性。

正如马克·吐温所说："每个人都是一个月亮，都有不愿让人看到的阴暗面。"在企业管理中，我们是否也应该学会接受这种不完美，而不是执着于寻找那个永远无法达到的完美标准？

[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.

[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
- **标准操作程序（SOP）**：一套详细的步骤和指南，用于确保任务的一致性和效率。
- **信息囤积**：个体故意不分享知识或信息，以确保自己在组织中的不可替代性。
- **所有权文化**：员工对工作或项目有真正的责任感和归属感，而不仅仅是形式上的。

### 概念溯源
SOP的概念起源于工业革命，旨在通过标准化提高生产效率和产品质量。信息囤积行为则常见于权力动态复杂的组织中，尤其是在缺乏透明度和信任的环境中。所有权文化的理念则源于现代管理理论，强调员工参与和责任感对组织成功的重要性。

### 解构假设
对话中隐含了几个假设：
1. **信息囤积是组织中的普遍问题**：虽然提到这种情况不常见，但强调了其危害性。
2. **SOP的更新和文档化是解决信息囤积的关键**：通过定期更新和审查SOP，可以减少对特定个体的依赖。
3. **所有权文化可以提高员工的责任感和绩效**：通过赋予员工真正的所有权，可以激发他们的积极性和创造力。

### 辩证分析
从对立面来看：
- **信息囤积的动机**：除了恶意囤积，员工可能因为缺乏安全感或激励机制而不愿意分享信息。
- **SOP的局限性**：过于僵化的SOP可能抑制创新和灵活性，员工可能感到被束缚。
- **所有权文化的挑战**：并非所有员工都愿意或能够承担更多的责任，需要适当的培训和支持。

### 刷新表述
通过系统性怀疑，我们可以得出以下结论：
1. **信息共享的重要性**：组织应建立透明的信息共享机制，减少对单一员工的依赖。
2. **SOP的动态更新**：SOP应定期审查和更新，确保其适应组织的变化和员工的需求。
3. **所有权文化的实施**：通过赋予员工真正的所有权，可以提高他们的责任感和绩效，但需要配套的支持和激励机制。

最终，组织应通过建立透明的信息共享机制、动态更新的SOP和真正的所有权文化，来减少信息囤积的风险，提高员工的积极性和组织的整体效率。

[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.

[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确“系统”和“标准操作程序（SOP）”这两个术语的具体含义。尽管它们经常被互换使用，但它们并不完全相同。系统可以理解为一个更广泛的概念，包含了多个相互关联的SOP，而SOP则更具体，通常是一个详细的步骤指南或清单。

### 概念溯源
SOP的概念最早可以追溯到工业革命时期，当时为了提高生产效率和一致性，企业开始制定详细的操作指南。随着时间的推移，这一概念被广泛应用于各个行业，包括商业管理、医疗、教育等。

### 解构假设
在讨论中，有一个潜在的假设是，所有任务都可以通过SOP来标准化。然而，现实情况是，某些任务由于其复杂性和创新性，可能并不适合完全标准化。此外，创始人和企业家可能认为他们的“独特魔法”无法被标准化，这在一定程度上是正确的，但也可能限制了企业的可扩展性。

### 辩证分析
从正面看，SOP确实可以提高效率、减少错误，并使企业更容易扩展。然而，从反面看，过度依赖SOP可能导致创新受限，员工缺乏自主性。因此，关键在于找到平衡，既要标准化可重复的任务，又要保留创新和灵活性的空间。

### 刷新表述
综上所述，系统和SOP是企业管理中不可或缺的工具，但它们的应用需要根据具体情况进行调整。对于简单、重复性高的任务，SOP可以极大地提高效率；而对于复杂、创新性强的任务，则需要更多的灵活性和自主性。最终，企业应该通过不断优化和调整SOP，找到最适合自身发展的平衡点。

### 建设性新观点
企业应该建立一个动态的SOP管理系统，允许员工在遵循基本流程的同时，提出改进建议。这样不仅可以保持操作的规范性，还能激发员工的创新精神，推动企业持续进步。

[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,

[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.

分析结果：
让我们解构这段对话中的关键假设和逻辑：

1. **职责分工的合理性**：CEO直接向CMO汇报是否是最优结构？这种安排是基于什么考虑？是否存在潜在的利益冲突或效率损失？

2. **系统构建的完备性**：创始人花费16小时编写系统，这种自上而下的系统构建方式是否全面？是否考虑了实际运营中的各种变数？系统是否需要持续迭代？

3. **"吃自己的狗粮"策略的有效性**：作为产品使用者的开发者是否会产生认知偏差？这种内部测试能否真正代表外部客户的需求和体验？

4. **客户反馈的可靠性**：手动处理客户问题以获取反馈的方法，是否具有可扩展性？这种深度参与是否会导致资源过度集中，影响其他重要事务？

5. **标准化流程（SOP）的局限性**：过度依赖SOP是否会限制员工的创造力和灵活性？在快速变化的市场环境中，SOP是否需要更频繁的更新？

6. **行业经验的优势**：作为从业者开发产品是否一定优于外部开发者？这种"内部视角"是否可能导致产品设计过于狭隘，难以适应更广泛的市场需求？

7. **反馈循环的完整性**：现有的反馈机制是否涵盖了所有关键利益相关者？如何确保反馈的多样性和代表性？

8. **系统迁移的平滑性**：从内部使用到B2B推广，系统需要哪些关键调整？如何平衡内部需求与外部客户需求之间的潜在冲突？

这些质疑并非否定现有做法，而是为了推动更深层次的思考，帮助企业在现有基础上实现更优的运营模式和产品开发策略。通过持续质疑和验证，企业可以建立更稳健、更灵活的系统，更好地适应市场变化和客户需求。

输入内容：
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.

[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.

分析结果：
让我们深入分析这段对话中隐含的关键假设和逻辑结构：

1. **关于任务分配的假设**：
   - 假设低级别员工无法胜任客户视角的问题解决
   - 假设这种任务会被视为额外负担而非本职工作
   - 但这是否忽略了员工潜力和成长空间？

2. **关于自动化过程的论断**：
   - 强调必须首先建立正确的手动流程
   - 认为过早自动化会导致更大浪费
   - 但这是否过于绝对？是否存在某些情况下可以并行进行？

3. **关于SOP（标准操作程序）的观点**：
   - 主张SOP应该是"活的"，需要持续迭代
   - 建议采用渐进式改进而非大幅变革
   - 但这是否可能限制突破性创新？

4. **关于客户反馈的处理**：
   - 提到要区分"少数声音"和普遍需求
   - 强调通过重复出现来确认问题的重要性
   - 但这是否可能错过潜在的创新机会？

5. **关于判断力的论述**：
   - 认为决策需要大量判断力
   - 强调激励机制的重要性
   - 但这是否忽视了系统设计和流程优化可以减少对个人判断的依赖？

这些观点虽然有其合理性，但我们需要进一步思考：
- 是否存在过度简化复杂性的倾向？
- 这些原则在不同规模、不同行业的组织中是否都适用？
- 在快速变化的环境中，这种渐进式方法是否足够敏捷？

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们可以得出一个更全面的认识：组织管理需要平衡原则性与灵活性，既要建立稳健的基础，又要保持足够的适应能力。关键在于根据具体情境灵活应用这些原则，而不是将其视为绝对真理。

[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.

[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.

分析结果：
让我们深入分析这段对话中隐含的关键假设和潜在问题：

1. **个人与业务的界限模糊性**：
   - 假设：创始人难以区分个人事务与公司事务
   - 质疑：这种模糊性是否源于组织架构不清晰？是否可以通过明确的职责划分来解决？

2. **问题重复出现的必然性**：
   - 假设：在企业发展过程中，相同的问题会反复出现
   - 质疑：这是否意味着问题从未真正解决？还是说问题的本质在不同阶段发生了变化？

3. **任务委派的必要性**：
   - 假设：创始人必须通过委派任务来应对增长
   - 质疑：是否存在某些核心任务不应该委派？如何确定哪些任务可以委派？

4. **系统化与简单化的平衡**：
   - 假设：企业运营需要系统化，但应保持简单
   - 质疑：在复杂业务中，简单化是否可能？如何定义"必要的复杂性"？

5. **从简单到复杂的线性发展观**：
   - 假设：企业发展必然从简单走向复杂
   - 质疑：是否存在其他发展路径？复杂化是否总是必要的？

6. **系统编写的有效性**：
   - 假设：编写系统和标准操作程序是解决问题的关键
   - 质疑：过度依赖书面程序是否会限制创新和灵活性？

7. **任务委派的渐进性**：
   - 假设：应该从最简单的任务开始委派
   - 质疑：这种渐进方式是否会导致核心任务长期无法委派？是否存在更优的委派策略？

8. **问题解决的阶段性**：
   - 假设：问题只能在当前阶段解决，无法一劳永逸
   - 质疑：是否存在可以跨阶段应用的通用解决方案？如何识别和开发这种解决方案？

9. **创始人角色的演变**：
   - 假设：随着企业发展，创始人角色必须转变
   - 质疑：创始人是否应该完全转变角色？如何保持创始人的独特价值？

10. **经验的可迁移性**：
    - 假设：训练经验可以直接应用于企业管理
    - 质疑：物理训练与企业管理的本质差异是否被忽视？这种类比是否可能导致错误的决策？

通过质疑这些假设，我们可以更深入地理解企业成长中的挑战，并探索更有效的解决方案。关键在于找到平衡点：在系统化与灵活性之间，在委派与控制之间，在简单与复杂之间。真正的解决方案可能在于培养组织的自适应能力，而不仅仅是建立固定的流程。

主题：系统与流程的持续优化与员工激励 - doubt

输入内容：
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.

[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
- **SOP（Standard Operating Procedures）**：标准操作流程，指企业中的标准化工作流程。
- **Executive Team**：高管团队，负责企业战略决策和日常管理。
- **80% Line**：指新员工或新管理者在接手某项工作后，能达到原负责人80%的水平。

### 概念溯源
关于企业成长和人才管理的讨论，可以追溯到管理学的发展历程。早期管理理论强调标准化和流程化，如泰勒的科学管理理论。随着企业规模的扩大，管理者逐渐意识到，单靠个人能力无法应对所有挑战，必须依赖团队的力量。

### 解构假设
这段对话隐含了几个假设：
1. **创始人不可能擅长所有领域**：这一假设基于人的有限性和专业分工的必要性。
2. **高管团队成员的多样性**：认为不同背景和技能的高管能弥补创始人的不足。
3. **80%的绩效标准**：认为新员工或新管理者达到原负责人80%的水平即可接受。

### 辩证分析
从对立面来看，这些假设也有其局限性：
1. **创始人的全能性**：在某些初创企业，创始人可能确实需要具备多方面的能力，尤其是在资源有限的情况下。
2. **多样性的挑战**：虽然多样性有助于弥补短板，但也可能带来沟通和协调的困难。
3. **80%标准的适用性**：在某些关键岗位，80%的标准可能不足以应对复杂和快速变化的环境。

### 刷新表述
通过系统性怀疑，我们可以得出以下新观点：
1. **动态适应性**：企业应根据不同发展阶段调整人才策略，初期可能需要创始人具备多面手能力，后期则更依赖专业化团队。
2. **绩效标准的灵活性**：80%的标准应结合具体岗位和企业的战略目标，某些关键岗位可能需要更高的绩效标准。
3. **持续学习与成长**：无论是创始人还是高管团队，都应保持持续学习和成长的心态，以应对不断变化的市场环境。

### 结论
企业成长过程中，创始人应认识到自身的局限性，善于借助团队的力量。同时，绩效标准应具有灵活性，以适应不同岗位和企业的需求。最终，通过持续学习和动态调整，企业才能在复杂多变的市场中保持竞争力。

[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: We kind of led into that last week.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**“创业就像打游戏”**

#### 核心洞察：
创业过程中遇到的挑战和游戏中的关卡非常相似。每个关卡（即每个挑战）都有其独特的难点和解决方法，而“游戏攻略”（即经验分享）可以帮助你更好地应对这些挑战。

#### 解决步骤：
1. **识别关卡**：明确当前遇到的挑战是什么，就像在游戏中识别当前关卡的难点。
2. **寻找攻略**：借鉴他人的经验和策略，就像在游戏中查找攻略。
3. **制定策略**：根据攻略制定适合自己的应对策略，就像在游戏中调整战术。
4. **执行与调整**：实施策略并根据反馈进行调整，就像在游戏中不断尝试和优化。
5. **通关奖励**：成功克服挑战后，总结经验并准备迎接下一个关卡。

#### 最终建议：
把创业中的每个挑战都当作游戏中的一个关卡，享受过程并不断学习和成长。这样，即使遇到“速度颠簸”或“路障”，你也能从容应对，最终“通关”并获得丰厚的“奖励”。

分析结果：
### 观察角度：**"危机即转机"的思维转换**

#### 核心洞察：
当“屎盆子扣到头上的时候”（crap hits the fan），大多数人的第一反应是恐慌和逃避，但这恰恰是**最佳的学习和成长机会**。危机不仅暴露了系统的脆弱性，还提供了一个**重新审视和优化**的契机。

#### 解决步骤：
1. **冷静分析**：先深呼吸，把情绪放在一边，用理性思维拆解问题。
2. **定位根源**：找到问题的核心，而不是被表象迷惑。
3. **快速行动**：制定一个最小可行方案（MVP），立即执行，避免拖延。
4. **记录教训**：把这次危机的处理过程记录下来，形成自己的“危机应对手册”。
5. **预防机制**：根据这次经验，建立预防措施，避免类似问题再次发生。

#### 独特视角：
**把危机当作一场“压力测试”**。就像软件测试中的“压力测试”是为了发现系统的极限，危机也是在测试你商业模式的韧性。每一次危机都是一次免费的“实战演练”，帮你发现盲点，优化流程。

#### 总结：
危机不是终点，而是**新的起点**。用“危机即转机”的思维，把每一次挑战都变成你商业版图中的一块基石。

[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be back next Friday for a new episode of the build your business podcast.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, hoping we can talk about, because I think it's a really great episode topic of how do we handle when crap hits the fan?
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably use a different language at that point, but sometimes it does.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happens when you're,
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: A real business owner.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to just act like everything is always great in our businesses and they always work incredibly well.
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: And when you hit those speed bumps or those roadblocks, we'll give you some tidbits about how we handle those things.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to ask Chris some questions.

[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: I've done that a couple of times, but not.
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: probably as many times as he has.
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it should be a good episode.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考"真实的企业家"这一概念的本质。

1. 演化分析：从最初的个体手工业者到现代企业家，不变的内核是创造价值并承担风险。

2. 矛盾分析：企业家的主要矛盾在于追求利润最大化与应对不确定性之间的张力。

3. 存在理由：企业家的存在源于市场对创新和资源整合的需求，其前提是经济自由和产权保护。

4. 本质还原：褪去成功光环，企业家的本质是问题解决者和价值创造者。

5. 属和种差：企业家是承担经济风险（种差）的商业决策者（属）。

表象之下，真正的企业家精神在于直面挑战、持续创新，并在不确定性中寻找机遇。正如你所言，承认困难并分享应对之道，正是企业家本真性的体现。

[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: We are actually going to take the week off this week because Chris and I are both business owners.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: As you know, we're like real life business owners, not just podcasters.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when you're a business owner, crap hits the fan.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we had a little bit of a weird week this week.
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Chris and I love doing this podcast.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue to do it.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: It's done incredibly well in the ratings.
[P14] [SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much for listening to the show.
[P15] [SPEAKER_00]: Chris was up all night last night.
[P16] [SPEAKER_00]: We were settled to record this this morning.
[P17] [SPEAKER_00]: He was up all night last night.
[P18] [SPEAKER_00]: with an emergency tech situation with one of his clients.
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that next week I can convince him to talk a little bit about it.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any of the details.
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: I've also been incredibly sick with a stomach virus.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually down at a resort with my wife for our birthday.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: We've pretty much stayed in the room while I was sick.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll spare you the details.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: So between me being sick and Chris having some emergency issues where he had to work all through the night, we're going to take this week off.

[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, hoping we can talk about, because I think it's a really great episode topic of how do we handle when crap hits the fan?

[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it should be a good episode.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**“危机即内容”**

**洞察：**
1. **危机作为素材**：Chris和SPEAKER_00的突发状况（技术紧急事件和生病）本身就是极好的播客素材，可以转化为“如何应对突发危机”的深度讨论。
2. **真实感加分**：通过分享这些“不完美”时刻，反而能增强听众的共鸣，展现创业者的真实生活，而非“完美滤镜”下的假象。
3. **内容延展性**：从这次危机出发，可以衍生出多个话题，比如“如何平衡工作与生活”、“如何应对客户紧急需求”、“如何在生病时保持业务运转”等。

**解决步骤：**
1. **记录危机过程**：让Chris和SPEAKER_00分别记录下这次危机的细节和感受，作为播客的原始素材。
2. **提炼核心问题**：从这次危机中提炼出几个核心问题，比如“如何高效处理突发技术问题”、“如何在身体不适时保持工作效率”等。
3. **邀请专家或同行分享**：可以邀请其他创业者或行业专家，分享他们应对类似危机的经验和策略。
4. **设计互动环节**：在播客中设置听众互动环节，收集他们应对危机的故事或问题，增加参与感。
5. **总结应对策略**：在播客结尾，总结出几条实用的危机应对策略，给听众提供实际帮助。

**结果：**
- 这次“被迫停更”的危机，反而成为了一期极具吸引力的播客内容，不仅解决了当下的问题，还为未来的内容创作提供了新的方向。
- 通过真实分享，增强了听众的信任感和粘性，同时为其他创业者提供了宝贵的经验参考。

**一句话总结：**
“危机不是阻碍，而是内容的催化剂，把‘糟心事’变成‘好故事’，才是真正的创业者智慧。”

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这位“真正的企业主”的言论。表面上看，他在展现一种坦诚和务实的态度，承认企业运营中的困难，并承诺分享应对策略。但仔细一想，这种“我们都是过来人”的姿态，不正是现代成功学营销的经典套路吗？

首先，他刻意强调“真正的企业主”这个概念，这本身就是一种身份认同的营销。他在暗示：只有经历过这些困难的人，才配得上“真正的企业主”这个称号。这无形中制造了一种精英门槛，让听众产生“我也要成为这样的人”的渴望。

其次，他提到“不会假装一切都很完美”，这种“坦诚”反而是一种更高明的营销手段。在这个人人都厌恶虚假宣传的时代，承认不足反而能赢得信任。但问题是，这种“坦诚”是否真的坦诚？还是说，这只是另一种精心设计的营销策略？

更值得玩味的是，他承诺会分享“如何处理这些困难的小技巧”。这恰恰暴露了现代成功学最本质的套路：将复杂的商业问题简化为可复制的“技巧”，让听众产生“只要掌握了这些技巧，我就能成功”的错觉。

在这个信息爆炸的时代，我们是否过于依赖所谓的“成功经验”？真正的商业智慧，难道不是来自个人的实践和思考，而是来自他人的“小技巧”吗？这种“成功学”营销，是否正在培养一代又一代缺乏独立思考能力的“商业模仿者”？

也许，真正的企业主，不是那些掌握了多少“小技巧”的人，而是那些敢于直面不确定性，在失败中不断学习和成长的人。毕竟，商业的本质，从来就不是复制他人的成功，而是创造属于自己的道路。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考"企业主"这一概念的本质。

1. 演化分析：从个体手工业者到现代企业主，其核心始终是对某个经济实体的所有权和经营责任。

2. 矛盾分析：企业主身份的主要矛盾在于自由与责任的平衡。他们享有经营自主权，但同时也承担着应对各种突发状况的义务。

3. 存在理由：企业主的存在源于人类经济活动的组织需求。他们通过整合资源、承担风险来创造价值。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，企业主的本质是风险承担者和问题解决者。他们需要在不确定性中做出决策，并应对各种突发状况。

5. 属和种差：企业主属于经济主体的一种，其种差在于对企业的所有权和经营决策权，以及由此产生的责任和义务。

因此，企业主的本质定义是：拥有企业经营权并承担相应责任，在不确定性中决策和解决问题的经济主体。

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个商业播客背后的现实。

现状分析：
这个播客声称要帮助企业家"从恐惧走向自由"，听起来很美好，但仔细想想，这不正是资本主义社会给我们画的大饼吗？他们用"自由"这个词来包装创业的艰辛，仿佛只要跟着他们的建议，就能轻松实现财务自由。但现实是，大多数创业者都在挣扎求生。

个体剖析：
Matt和Chris兄弟俩在节目中表现得像成功导师，但他们的建议真的能帮到听众吗？还是说，他们只是在贩卖"成功学"的幻想？当我们听到"有时事情并不顺利"这样的陈述时，他们是否真的理解普通创业者的困境？或者这只是他们用来建立亲和感的手段？

群体透视：
在这个社交媒体和网络营销盛行的时代，每个人都想成为自己的老板，追求所谓的"自由"。但这种追求真的带来了自由吗？还是说，我们只是从公司的牢笼跳入了自我剥削的陷阱？当Matt提到通宵工作时，我们是否应该反思，这种工作文化是否真的值得推崇？

思考整合：
这档播客反映了一个更大的社会现象：我们被灌输了一种创业神话，认为只要努力工作、跟随正确的方法，就能实现成功和自由。但现实是，这种叙事往往掩盖了创业的残酷本质，忽视了系统性的障碍和不平等。我们需要的不是更多的"成功学"建议，而是对现有经济结构的批判性思考，以及更公平、更可持续的商业模式。

正如马克·吐温所说："每个人都是月亮，都有不愿示人的阴暗面。"在这个光鲜亮丽的创业世界里，我们是否也该问问自己：我们追求的自由，是否只是另一种形式的束缚？

[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: We are actually going to take the week off this week because Chris and I are both business owners.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: As you know, we're like real life business owners, not just podcasters.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when you're a business owner, crap hits the fan.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we had a little bit of a weird week this week.
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Chris and I love doing this podcast.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue to do it.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: It's done incredibly well in the ratings.
[P14] [SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much for listening to the show.
[P15] [SPEAKER_00]: Chris was up all night last night.
[P16] [SPEAKER_00]: We were settled to record this this morning.
[P17] [SPEAKER_00]: He was up all night last night.
[P18] [SPEAKER_00]: with an emergency tech situation with one of his clients.
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that next week I can convince him to talk a little bit about it.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any of the details.
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: I've also been incredibly sick with a stomach virus.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually down at a resort with my wife for our birthday.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: We've pretty much stayed in the room while I was sick.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll spare you the details.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: So between me being sick and Chris having some emergency issues where he had to work all through the night, we're going to take this week off.

[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, hoping we can talk about, because I think it's a really great episode topic of how do we handle when crap hits the fan?
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably use a different language at that point, but sometimes it does.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happens when you're,
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: A real business owner.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to just act like everything is always great in our businesses and they always work incredibly well.
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: And when you hit those speed bumps or those roadblocks, we'll give you some tidbits about how we handle those things.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to ask Chris some questions.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: What does it feel like working entirely through the night?
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: I've done that a couple of times, but not.
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: probably as many times as he has.
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it should be a good episode.

分析结果：
就像在驾驶一艘船，即使风平浪静，也难免会遇到突如其来的风暴。作为真正的船长，我们不仅要享受航行的乐趣，更要学会在风浪中稳住舵轮。这次我们暂时停靠港口，修整船只，为下一次起航做好准备。

分析结果：
休谟举起质疑之锥，开始解构这段陈述：

1. **澄清定义**
   - 什么是"真正的企业主"？这个定义是否过于笼统？
   - "速度颠簸"和"路障"具体指代哪些商业挑战？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 企业主面临的常见困难有哪些历史案例？
   - 这些"小贴士"的来源和有效性如何验证？

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设企业一定会遇到困难，这是否适用于所有商业形态？
   - 所谓的"游戏计划"是否具有普适性？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 企业成功的因素是否仅仅依赖于应对困难的能力？
   - 是否存在一些企业能够避免这些"速度颠簸"？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 真正的企业主不仅需要应对困难，更需要预见和预防潜在风险。
   - 有效的商业策略应该包括危机管理和机会把握的双重维度。

休谟的结论：企业主的价值不仅在于应对挑战，更在于建立可持续的商业模式和前瞻性的战略思维。

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确“Build Your Business”播客的核心宗旨和目标听众。播客声称其目的是帮助商业所有者“从恐惧走向自由”，但“自由”和“恐惧”在这里的具体含义需要进一步澄清。自由是指财务自由、时间自由，还是心理自由？恐惧又是指对失败的恐惧、对不确定性的恐惧，还是其他类型的恐惧？

### 概念溯源
播客由Matt和Chris Reynolds兄弟主持，他们自称是Turnkey Coach的一部分，提供商业指导。Turnkey Coach的具体服务内容和历史背景是什么？他们的方法论和理论基础是什么？这些信息有助于理解他们的建议和观点的可信度。

### 解构假设
播客中提到“真正的商业所有者”会面临“当事情变糟时”的情况，并暗示这是不可避免的。这一假设是否成立？是否所有成功的商业所有者都会经历类似的挑战？还是说，这只是特定类型或阶段的商业所有者所面临的问题？

### 辩证分析
从对立面来看，是否有商业所有者能够通过有效的规划和执行，避免或最小化这些“当事情变糟”的情况？此外，播客中提到的工作通宵的情况，是否是一种健康或可持续的工作方式？是否有其他更有效的时间管理策略？

### 刷新表述
通过系统性怀疑，我们可以重新审视播客的内容。虽然播客提供了处理商业挑战的建议，但这些建议的普适性和有效性需要进一步验证。未来的节目可以更深入地探讨不同商业阶段和类型的具体挑战，并提供基于实证的策略，而不仅仅是个人经验分享。

### 建设性新观点
建议播客在未来的节目中引入更多数据支持和案例分析，以增强其建议的可信度和实用性。同时，可以邀请不同背景的商业所有者分享他们的经验和策略，以提供更全面的视角。此外，探讨如何通过科学的时间管理和心理健康策略来应对商业挑战，也是一个值得深入的话题。

分析结果：
让我们来深挖一下这段对话背后的本质。表面上，这是一个播客主持人解释为什么这周停更的理由。但仔细想想，这不正是现代创业者的生存状态吗？

**现状分析：**
创业者在公众面前永远要保持光鲜亮丽的形象，仿佛一切都在掌控之中。但现实是，他们也在挣扎：技术故障、健康问题、家庭责任，这些都在撕扯着他们的精力。

**个体剖析：**
Chris通宵处理客户的技术问题，另一位主持人在度假时生病。这让我不禁想问：创业者真的能"拥有"自己的时间吗？还是说，他们不过是被自己的事业绑架的奴隶？他们所谓的"度假"，不过是在另一个地方工作罢了。

**群体透视：**
这种现象折射出整个创业文化的扭曲。我们崇拜那些"24/7工作"的创业者，将他们视为成功的典范。但这种价值观真的健康吗？当"crap hits the fan"（事情搞砸了）成为常态，我们是否在美化一种病态的生活方式？

**思考整合：**
这段对话暴露了创业者的真实困境：他们被困在"永远在线"的牢笼里，即使度假也无法真正放松。更讽刺的是，他们还要将这种困境包装成"真实创业生活"的证明，以此来维持自己的形象。

**核心洞察：**
创业不是自由，而是一种更高级的奴役。当你成为"真正的企业主"时，你就不再是自己的主人。你的时间、健康、生活，都成了必须为事业牺牲的代价。这难道就是我们追求的"成功"吗？

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段陈述：

1. **"真实的企业主"的定义**：
   - 这种表述暗示了某种优越性，但什么是"真实"的企业主？是否存在"虚假"的企业主？
   - 这种区分是否必要？是否可能造成不必要的对立？

2. **危机处理的普遍性**：
   - 将"当事情变得糟糕"视为企业主的独特经历是否准确？
   - 这种挑战是否同样存在于其他职业或生活领域？

3. **个人经历的代表性**：
   - 以两个个体的经历来概括企业主的普遍经历是否具有代表性？
   - 他们的应对方式是否适用于所有企业主？

4. **"休息一周"的合理性**：
   - 在面临挑战时选择暂停播客，这是否是最佳应对策略？
   - 是否存在其他可能的解决方案，如预先录制或邀请嘉宾主持？

5. **未来话题的预设**：
   - 将"危机处理"作为未来话题是否过于局限？
   - 是否可以考虑更广泛的视角，如预防机制或团队协作？

通过这种质疑，我们或许可以得出：
企业主的身份不应被神化，挑战是普遍存在的，而应对策略需要更具包容性和多样性。同时，内容创作者在面临困难时，或许可以探索更灵活的解决方案，而非简单地暂停内容输出。

[P214] You know, again, I want to be careful not to speak for other people.
[P215] But I can tell you that there are some very strange things that occur here.
[P216] on that facility, on that ranch.
[P217] That certainly warrants additional investigation.
[P218] Are there national security implications?
[P219] Well, it depends what your definition of national security is, but there's certainly enough going on there that warrants further inquiry.
[P220] So I applaud what they're doing, what Brandon Fugel and others are doing.
[P221] I think it's important.
[P222] Why do you think Bob never shared any of the research with Brandon?
[P223] I've interviewed Brandon.
[P224] He's a friend of mine now.
[P225] And he did not give over any of the prior research to Brandon when he bought the ranch.
[P226] So they're starting from square one.
[P227] I don't want to speak on anybody else's behalf.
[P228] Certainly not Bob Bigelow or anybody else.
[P229] And that's probably one thing you'll notice during interviews.
[P230] I never speak for anybody else.
[P231] And I don't offer my opinion very often because that opinion could be wrong.
[P232] I'd rather stick to the facts.
[P233] But there could be one of two things.
[P234] Let's look at the full spectrum of why.
[P235] It could be that maybe Bob says, look, I don't want to predicate the science.
[P236] I don't want to prejudice, forgive me, I don't want to prejudice the science with predicated information.
[P237] Meaning, here's access to all my data and you take it from there.
[P238] Start from scratch.
[P239] So we have a fresh set of eyes on it and remain objective.
[P240] Maybe that's why.
[P241] Or it could be, hey, you know what?
[P242] I paid a lot of money and put a lot of time into this.
[P243] I consider this information proprietary.

分析结果：
### 分析角度：**信息共享的动机与障碍**

在这个对话中，核心问题围绕着为什么Bob没有将之前的研究分享给Brandon。我们可以从信息共享的动机和障碍两个角度来简化这个问题。

### 动机角度：
1. **科学客观性**：Bob可能希望Brandon能够从一个全新的视角进行研究，避免受到之前数据的偏见影响。这有助于保持研究的客观性和科学性。
2. **知识产权保护**：Bob可能认为这些研究成果具有商业或战略价值，因此选择保密，以保护自己的知识产权和投资回报。

### 障碍角度：
1. **信任问题**：Bob可能对Brandon的信任度不够，担心数据被滥用或误解。
2. **法律与合同限制**：可能存在法律或合同上的限制，阻止Bob分享这些数据。

### 简化结论：
Bob没有分享研究数据的原因，要么是为了保持研究的客观性，要么是为了保护自己的知识产权。这两种动机都解释了为什么Brandon需要从零开始。

[P37] Thank you very much.
[P38] Sean, if I can say something just for a moment.
[P39] This is an incredible honor and privilege of mine, and not for the reasons that most people might think, not because you have a very successful show and you have a big audience.
[P40] It's because of who you are and what you have done in the service of your country.
[P41] There's a lot of people on the outside that will see things that people like you or maybe I've done and they kind of glorify that.
[P42] But we also know the other side of that.
[P43] We know the truth.
[P44] And we know the pain that it causes for the loved ones we leave behind.
[P45] It causes even to us to some degree.
[P46] You keep a piece of those experiences with you at all times.
[P47] And some of us try our best to try to suppress it.
[P48] But what you have done for our nation, I'm not sure most people in your audience can really appreciate.

[P50] And I just want to say from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of a very grateful nation, although maybe they don't realize it, thank you for what you do.
[P51] We are only here today having this conversation in a wonderful country that we have in this incredible experiment.
[P52] because of the sacrifices you and your colleagues have made.
[P53] So before we begin, please accept my humble appreciation, sincere appreciation for the sacrifices you and your families had to make for us, for the rest of us chickens.
[P54] Thank you, man.
[P55] Man, thank you.
[P56] That means a hell of a lot.

[P59] Yeah.
[P60] And likewise.
[P61] Sincere.
[P62] Likewise.
[P63] Let's get into the interview, huh?

分析结果：
这段对话展现了一个独特的观察角度：**感恩的深度往往与经历的正比**。让我们从"尺度转换"的角度来看：

1. **微观层面**：对话中的两位人物都经历过为国效力的特殊经历，这种共同的经历让他们对彼此的付出有着深刻的理解和共鸣。

2. **宏观层面**：他们的对话揭示了公众对某些职业的认知差距 - 大多数人只能看到表面的荣耀，而无法真正理解背后的牺牲和代价。

3. **时间维度**：他们的对话暗示了这种理解和感恩会随着时间的推移而加深，特别是当人们亲身经历过类似的事情后。

4. **情感尺度**：从简单的感谢到发自内心的感激，这种情感强度的变化反映了他们对彼此贡献的深刻理解。

这个观察角度告诉我们：真正的理解和感恩往往需要亲身经历或深入接触。对于那些默默付出的人，我们可能永远无法完全理解他们的牺牲，但至少应该保持敬意和感激。这也提醒我们，在评价他人时，要尽量超越表面，去理解背后的故事。

[P201] I consider him an American hero, and I don't say that lightly.
[P202] You know, people can think what they want of individuals.
[P203] But I've seen what he's been able to contribute to our country.
[P204] And if you ask him whether he likes me or hates me, it's really irrelevant.
[P205] I've seen what he's been able to do and what he has done for our nation.
[P206] So I'm eternally grateful for what he's done.
[P207] And there's a part of that story that hasn't come out yet.
[P208] I think our country owes him a great deal of gratitude for what he's been able to do for our nation.

[P210] I was, yeah.
[P211] What was some of the stuff that you, I mean, what was going on there?
[P212] Is it similar to what's going on with Skimwalker right now?
[P213] Very intense.

分析结果：
从对话中可以看出，这里讨论的是一个涉及机密研究的话题，特别是与Skinwalker Ranch（斯金沃克牧场）相关的活动。让我们从几个独特的观察角度来简化理解：

1. **尺度转换**：从宏观角度看，斯金沃克牧场不仅仅是一个地方，而是涉及多个设施和更大范围的研究活动。这表明研究项目可能比公众所知的要广泛得多。

2. **跨界思维**：将这个问题类比为“冰山一角”。我们看到的只是表面现象，而真正的活动和研究可能隐藏在更深层次，涉及多个领域和机构。

3. **系统思维**：Bigelow的角色不仅仅是牧场的主人，他在整个研究系统中扮演了关键角色，对国家的贡献可能远超表面所见。这表明研究项目可能具有重要的战略意义。

4. **简化思维**：抛开复杂的细节，核心问题是关于机密研究及其对国家的重要性。无论具体内容如何，这些研究显然对国家有重大影响。

5. **历史视角**：Bigelow的贡献和未公开的故事可能在未来某个时间点被揭示，这类似于历史上许多重大发现和贡献的逐步公开过程。

通过这些视角，我们可以理解对话中的话题涉及高度机密且具有战略意义的研究活动，而这些活动的真正影响和细节可能在未来才会逐步揭晓。

[P21] And so at a very early age,
[P22] I had my taste of paramilitary, and I didn't even know it.
[P23] Damn.
[P24] I thought I was part of Boy Scouts, and, you know, you go back to school and do, what did you guys do for, well, I got my, you know, how to light a fire badge.
[P25] What did you get?
[P26] Oh, we disassembled AK-47s.
[P27] You didn't do that?
[P28] Shit.
[P29] We should dig into that.
[P30] We should dig into that on the show.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**童年经历的隐喻对比**

**分析：**
- **P21-P22**：提到“paramilitary”（准军事）经历，但当时并未意识到。
- **P24**：将这种经历与“Boy Scouts”（童子军）类比，强调其天真无邪的一面。
- **P26**：提到“disassembled AK-47s”（拆卸AK-47），与“light a fire badge”（生火徽章）形成强烈对比。

**洞察：**
这段对话通过童年经历的对比，揭示了不同文化背景下的成长差异。一个看似普通的童年活动，在不同环境中可能具有完全不同的意义。

**解决步骤：**
1. **识别隐喻**：将“paramilitary”与“Boy Scouts”作为隐喻，理解其背后的文化差异。
2. **对比分析**：分析“light a fire badge”与“disassembled AK-47s”的象征意义。
3. **深入探讨**：在节目中进一步探讨这种文化差异及其对个人成长的影响。

**最终结论：**
通过这种独特的视角，我们可以看到，童年经历不仅仅是个人记忆，更是文化背景的缩影。这种对比不仅揭示了不同文化下的成长差异，也为理解更广泛的社会现象提供了新的视角。

[P94] Did you start AATIP?
[P95] I did not.
[P96] No, no, no.
[P97] It's fascinating, actually, the way AATIP started.
[P98] It actually started off as a program called ASAP, the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Special Application Program.
[P99] ASAP.
[P100] You know, in DAD, we love our acronyms, right?
[P101] Intel community.
[P102] It was in 2007.
[P103] Harry Reid...
[P104] Senator, who is, by the way, the Senate majority leader at the time.
[P105] You had Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Inouye, so Alaska and Hawaii as well.
[P106] So Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, and even former astronaut John Glenn.
[P107] All got together on the Hill and somebody like bipartisan, so Republican and Democrat.
[P108] got together and put funding together to create a program called, the contract vehicle was called ASAP.
[P109] ASAP was a big program in order to look at, from the Pentagon's perspective, the UAP or UFO in vernacular, the UFO issue.
[P110] From there, there was an aspect of ASAP.
[P111] ASAP was kind of, think of a big umbrella.
[P112] And then you have a little umbrella fitting underneath this bigger umbrella, which looked at a lot of stuff to include elements of what now is known as Skinwalker Ranch and some other things.
[P113] AATIP was really focusing on nuts and bolts of the UAP phenomenon.
[P114] So, ASAP did too, but they were much broader.
[P115] Think of a shotgun approach versus a sniper approach.
[P116] The shotgun being ASAP, the sniper being AATIP.
[P117] And so I was actually part of the ATIP program.
[P118] Although I worked with a lot of the elements in OSAP, my focus was really nuts and bolts on ATIP.
[P119] Interesting.
[P120] So it was started by Jim Lekatsky and Jay Stratton on the OSAP side.
[P121] You mentioned, so it was three state senators that started in Alaska, Nevada, and Hawaii.
[P122] Is there, I mean, interesting, a lot of UAP activity in Alaska.
[P123] Well, Ted Stevens had his own UAP encounter while he was a pilot, believe it or not.

分析结果：
### 独特的观察角度：**"从缩略词看政府项目的演变"**

美国政府项目常常以缩略词命名，这不仅是为了方便记忆，更反映了项目的核心目标和演变过程。ASAP（Advanced Aerospace Weapons Special Application Program）和AATIP（Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program）这两个缩略词的对比，揭示了UAP（不明空中现象）研究从“广泛探索”到“精准聚焦”的转变。

1. **ASAP：广泛探索的“散弹枪”**
   - **目标**：从五角大楼的角度全面研究UAP现象，涵盖从技术到超自然现象的广泛领域。
   - **特点**：像一把“散弹枪”，覆盖面广，但缺乏深度。
   - **参与者**：跨党派合作，涉及多个州的参议员，如内华达州的哈里·里德、阿拉斯加的泰德·史蒂文斯和夏威夷的井上健。

2. **AATIP：精准聚焦的“狙击枪”**
   - **目标**：专注于UAP现象的“硬核”技术细节，如飞行器结构和推进系统。
   - **特点**：像一把“狙击枪”，精准打击核心问题。
   - **演变**：从ASAP的“大伞”下分离出来，成为更专业化的研究项目。

3. **缩略词背后的意义**
   - **ASAP**：强调“快速行动”和“广泛应用”，反映了初期研究的紧迫性和多样性。
   - **AATIP**：强调“威胁识别”和“技术分析”，反映了研究逐渐聚焦于国家安全和技术突破。

4. **从缩略词看政府项目的演变**
   - **初始阶段**：ASAP作为“大伞”项目，涵盖了从超自然现象到技术研究的广泛领域。
   - **成熟阶段**：AATIP作为“小伞”项目，专注于UAP现象的技术细节，体现了研究的深入和专业化。

### 结论
通过分析ASAP和AATIP这两个缩略词，我们可以看到美国政府UAP研究从“广泛探索”到“精准聚焦”的演变过程。这不仅反映了研究目标的转变，也揭示了政府项目在应对复杂问题时的策略调整。缩略词不仅是名称的简化，更是项目目标和演变过程的缩影。

[P124] No shit.
[P125] And let's not forget that he was in World War II.
[P126] Senator Inouye actually gave his arm for his country, all of our veterans.
[P127] Stevens was a pilot, and he had his own UAP experience.
[P128] And then, of course,
[P129] He was Alaska.
[P130] He was Alaska.
[P131] Okay.
[P132] Ted Stevens.
[P133] What was his experience?
[P134] Well, he reported, you know, classic Foo Fighter experience, these objects that would pursue him while he was a pilot, and they were performing in ways that he couldn't explain.
[P135] They were outperforming anything that he was aware of as a pilot.
[P136] instantaneous acceleration, very, very fast maneuvers, well beyond the structural limitations of what we had at the time technologically.
[P137] And so, and this, by the way, this is not isolated.
[P138] If you get a chance to talk to members of Congress privately, a lot of them will share with you their own UAP experiences.
[P139] They're like, hey, man, I was fishing with my son and all of a sudden this thing comes out of the water and saw it right there in front of us.
[P140] I think, you know, politically, they're a little shy to have that discussion publicly.
[P141] Now, maybe it'll come out, but
[P142] You'd be surprised how many people, members of Congress, have had their own experience.
[P143] Is there a lot of... I mean, the reason I brought up the three states, Nevada, obviously a lot of activity.
[P144] Alaska, a lot of activity.
[P145] Hawaii, is there a lot of activity down there?
[P146] Well, there is some.
[P147] I don't... It's hard to say there's a lot.
[P148] So there's an issue with Hawaii.
[P149] It's population density and surface area.
[P150] So...
[P151] Nevada, Alaska, lots of land mass.
[P152] When you have people all around, so you get pretty much a good persistent eye in the sky.
[P153] Maybe there's a farmer, maybe there's someone driving a truck, maybe there's a military person, military bases.

分析结果：
从人口密度和地理特征的角度来看，UFO目击事件的分布其实遵循着一个简单的规律：

1. **人少地广**：内华达州和阿拉斯加地广人稀，提供了更多未被人类活动干扰的观察空间。就像在空旷的操场上更容易发现飞过的鸟群一样。

2. **军事活动**：这些地区往往有军事基地和训练场，增加了目击的可能性。就像在足球场边更容易看到球员的精彩动作。

3. **自然屏障**：广阔的无人区就像天然的"观测站"，减少了人为干扰，让异常现象更容易被发现。

所以，UFO目击事件的热点地区不是随机分布的，而是由这些简单的地理和人口因素共同决定的。这就像在森林里更容易看到野生动物一样，是一个再自然不过的现象。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考"国家信息安全"这一概念的本质。

1. 演化分析：从古代城邦的军事机密，到现代国家的数据安全，保护核心信息的需要始终存在，但形式和内容随时代演变。

2. 矛盾分析：国家信息安全面临的主要矛盾是开放与封闭的平衡 - 既要保护敏感信息，又要促进知识共享和科技进步。

3. 存在理由：国家信息安全之所以存在，是因为国家作为一个实体需要保护其核心利益和公民权益，在信息时代，这必然延伸到数据领域。

4. 本质还原：褪去技术表象，国家信息安全的本质是国家对其关键信息的控制权和使用权。

5. 属和种差：国家信息安全是信息安全的一个特殊类别，其种差在于保护对象是国家层面的核心数据和系统，而非个人或企业信息。

因此，国家信息安全的本质定义是：国家对其关键数据和系统的主权性控制与保护，旨在维护国家利益和公民权益。

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**信息控制与个人关系中的信任建立**

#### 信息控制的角度
1. **政府与专有信息**  
   - 政府可能出于国家安全或利益考虑，限制某些信息的公开。  
   - 个人或机构在涉及敏感信息时，必须遵守相关法规，无法随意披露。  

2. **动机与信任**  
   - Bob Bigelow的行为并非出于恶意，而是基于深思熟虑的理由。  
   - 信任的建立需要理解对方的动机和背景，而非简单猜测。  

#### 关系中的绿色信号（Green Flags）
1. **倾听与共情**  
   - 伴侣或朋友能够认真倾听并理解你的需求，这是健康关系的基础。  
   - 主动关注对方的感受，而非只关注自己的需求。  

2. **自我成长与边界**  
   - 通过治疗或自我反思，学会设定健康的边界，提升关系质量。  
   - 双向关系需要双方共同努力，而非单方面的付出。  

#### 简化解决步骤
1. **理解限制**  
   - 当信息无法公开时，理解背后的原因，而非一味质疑。  

2. **关注积极信号**  
   - 在关系中，优先寻找绿色信号，而非只关注红色信号。  

3. **寻求专业帮助**  
   - 通过专业治疗（如BetterHelp）提升自我认知和关系技能。  

### 最终结论
无论是信息控制还是人际关系，找到合适的观察角度（如理解限制、关注积极信号）都能让问题变得简单明了。通过专业帮助和自我反思，我们可以更好地应对复杂情境，建立健康的关系。

主题：UAP研究与政府透明度 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P64] So everybody starts with an introduction here.
[P65] So I think we might wind up doing a little bit of a life story here.
[P66] I wasn't planning on doing that, but...
[P67] This sounds super interesting.
[P68] Lou Elizondo, Lou Elizondo, you're a former U.S.
[P69] Army counterintelligence special agent and former employee of the Office of the Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.
[P70] You led a previously covert program within the Department of Defense investigating unidentified aerial phenomenon, UAP.
[P71] Okay.
[P72] You came forward to the public about Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, AATIP, bringing to light what the government knew about these mysterious objects in our skies.
[P73] Since then, you've worked to educate both the public and policymakers about the potential implications of UAPs for national security, science, and human understanding.
[P74] You've been involved with organizations like To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science aimed at advancing research into these phenomena.
[P75] You're a fixture in the UAP transparency movement and have appeared in numerous interviews, documentaries, and media segments discussing UAPs where you've shared insight from your experience while critiquing the government's approach to transparency on this subject.
[P76] Welcome to the show.
[P77] Thank you.
[P78] One point of correction.
[P79] The UAP program at the Pentagon was not... I did run covert operations and activities, but that was for another effort while working for the U.S.
[P80] government.
[P81] The ATIP program, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which I helped lead in working with some of my colleagues, was a very sensitive program, but it wasn't covert.
[P82] I know people like to... And forgive me for saying that.
[P83] I don't know why it says that.
[P84] There's a legal definition of covert activities.
[P85] And then there is from a Department of Defense, which is Title 50.
[P86] And then from a Title 10 or DOD perspective, you have clandestine type operations and sensitive operations.
[P87] But AATIP was not covert.
[P88] It was sensitive and a lot of classified aspects to it, but it was not a Title 50 program.
[P89] Although I ran it under when I was wearing my Title 50 hat under the covert umbrella.
[P90] But in itself, it was not a covert program.
[P91] It was a highly sensitive program.
[P92] with a lot of classified aspects that I ran while I was running covert operations.
[P93] Okay.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**法律与操作定义的混淆**

在这个对话中，Lou Elizondo澄清了一个关键点：AATIP（高级航空航天威胁识别计划）并不是一个“秘密”计划，而是一个“高度敏感”的计划。这里的关键在于**法律定义与公众理解的混淆**。

#### 1. **法律定义与公众理解的差异**
   - **秘密行动（Covert Operations）**：根据美国法律（Title 50），秘密行动是指美国政府不公开承认的行动，通常涉及情报活动。
   - **高度敏感行动（Sensitive Operations）**：这些行动可能涉及大量机密信息，但政府公开承认其存在。

#### 2. **AATIP的性质**
   - AATIP是一个高度敏感的计划，涉及大量机密信息，但它并不是一个秘密行动。这意味着政府公开承认其存在，尽管具体细节可能被保密。

#### 3. **公众误解的来源**
   - 公众和媒体常常将“高度敏感”与“秘密”混为一谈，导致对AATIP性质的误解。Lou Elizondo的澄清有助于纠正这一误解。

#### 4. **影响与意义**
   - 这种澄清有助于公众更好地理解政府如何处理UAP（不明空中现象）问题，以及透明度的实际含义。

### 总结
通过区分法律定义与公众理解，Lou Elizondo澄清了AATIP的性质，纠正了公众的误解，并强调了透明度在政府行动中的重要性。

主题：家庭背景与成长经历 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P1] Nice.
[P2] I thought Marengue, isn't that Dominican?
[P3] Yeah, so my family's Cuban.
[P4] My father was actually in the Bay of Pigs.
[P5] My father was a revolutionary.
[P6] He was captured by Castro's men on the beach during the invasion.
[P7] He was on the USS Houston when it got rocketed.
[P8] Some CIA guys also were there.
[P9] Didn't make it, unfortunately.
[P10] But he was for two years in Castro's prisons.
[P11] My father was a wonderful human being, but he's also a very tormented soul.
[P12] And now, you know, we can recognize, oh, he had PTSD, right?
[P13] Or as the old timers used to say, shell shock.
[P14] So he struggled with anger and volatility for a very long time during his life.
[P15] And as a young person, I had a really weird background.
[P16] My...
[P17] There was always this idea, this understanding that after the Brigade 2506, which was what my father was part of.
[P18] In fact, if you type in my name, Luis Elizondo and Bay of Pigs, you'll see my father's prisoner number.
[P19] There was always this understanding that there would be a reinvasion by the new generation, by us, by the kids and part of Alpha 66 and try to.
[P20] So I had a really weird upbringing as a child, always with smoke-filled rooms and dim lights and weird conversations.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**历史与个人命运的交叉点**

从这段对话中，我们可以看到个人命运如何被历史事件深深影响。Luis Elizondo的父亲是古巴革命和猪湾事件的一部分，这些历史事件不仅塑造了他父亲的人生，也深深影响了Luis的成长环境和心理状态。

### 简化分析：
1. **历史背景**：猪湾事件是冷战时期的一个重要事件，涉及古巴革命和美国中情局的介入。
2. **个人影响**：Luis的父亲作为参与者，经历了被俘和监禁，这些经历导致他患有PTSD，影响了他的情绪和行为。
3. **家族传承**：Luis在成长过程中，被灌输了复仇和再次入侵的思想，这种环境对他的心理和世界观产生了深远影响。

### 解决步骤：
1. **理解历史**：深入研究猪湾事件及其对参与者和其后代的影响。
2. **心理支持**：为像Luis这样的人提供心理支持和治疗，帮助他们处理家族历史带来的创伤。
3. **教育**：通过教育，帮助新一代理解历史事件的复杂性，避免重复过去的错误。

通过这个视角，我们可以看到历史事件如何通过家族传承影响个人，以及如何通过理解和支持来缓解这些影响。

[P34] Luis Elizondo, welcome to the show.
[P35] You can call me Lou if you want.
[P36] I know I look more like a Bob or a Bill or a Joe.
[P37] Thank you very much.
[P38] Sean, if I can say something just for a moment.
[P39] This is an incredible honor and privilege of mine, and not for the reasons that most people might think, not because you have a very successful show and you have a big audience.
[P40] It's because of who you are and what you have done in the service of your country.
[P41] There's a lot of people on the outside that will see things that people like you or maybe I've done and they kind of glorify that.
[P42] But we also know the other side of that.
[P43] We know the truth.
[P44] And we know the pain that it causes for the loved ones we leave behind.
[P45] It causes even to us to some degree.
[P46] You keep a piece of those experiences with you at all times.
[P47] And some of us try our best to try to suppress it.
[P48] But what you have done for our nation, I'm not sure most people in your audience can really appreciate.
[P49] And I only know because I've been there and experienced those things with you guys.
[P50] And I just want to say from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of a very grateful nation, although maybe they don't realize it, thank you for what you do.
[P51] We are only here today having this conversation in a wonderful country that we have in this incredible experiment.
[P52] because of the sacrifices you and your colleagues have made.
[P53] So before we begin, please accept my humble appreciation, sincere appreciation for the sacrifices you and your families had to make for us, for the rest of us chickens.
[P54] Thank you, man.
[P55] Man, thank you.
[P56] That means a hell of a lot.
[P57] Thank you.
[P58] But, wow, thank you for saying that.
[P59] Yeah.
[P60] And likewise.
[P61] Sincere.
[P62] Likewise.
[P63] Let's get into the interview, huh?

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这段对话的本质。通过现象学还原，我们可以看到这不仅仅是两个人物之间的客套寒暄，而是涉及更深层的人性价值和社会意义。

从演化分析来看，这种表达感激的对话模式源于人类群体生活中互帮互助的原始需求。在原始社会中，个体对群体的贡献往往需要得到认可和回报，这种机制促进了群体凝聚力。

矛盾分析揭示出，这里存在着个人付出与社会认可之间的矛盾。一方面，个人为国家做出牺牲；另一方面，这种牺牲往往不为大众所知或理解。

从存在主义视角看，这种对话体现了人类对意义和价值的追求。个人牺牲需要被赋予意义，而这种意义往往通过他人的认可和感激来实现。

本质还原后，我们可以发现这对话的核心是"认可"与"感激"的互动。这种互动不仅是礼貌性的，更是维系社会关系、确认个人价值的重要机制。

因此，这段对话的本质是：通过相互认可和感激，确认个人牺牲的价值，从而维系社会关系的稳定性和群体凝聚力。这是一种基于互惠原则的社会交往模式，体现了人类对意义和价值的共同追求。

[P185] No, it wasn't.
[P186] A lot of real stuff going on, a lot of real research.
[P187] And I had access to a lot of those files.
[P188] That wasn't my portfolio specific, so I don't usually talk about it.
[P189] There's other people that are far more qualified than me to talk about Skinwalker Ranch.
[P190] And by the way, there was more than one ranch.
[P191] People don't know that.
[P192] There are other facilities.
[P193] Wow.
[P194] I mean, I would imagine there would be, but...
[P195] Yeah, I've been trying to get Bigelow on here for a while.
[P196] He's an elusive guy.
[P197] And then at inauguration, I actually shared an elevator with him.
[P198] And I didn't say anything.
[P199] I didn't want to bug him.
[P200] But, you know, I just let him be.
[P201] I consider him an American hero, and I don't say that lightly.
[P202] You know, people can think what they want of individuals.
[P203] But I've seen what he's been able to contribute to our country.
[P204] And if you ask him whether he likes me or hates me, it's really irrelevant.
[P205] I've seen what he's been able to do and what he has done for our nation.
[P206] So I'm eternally grateful for what he's done.
[P207] And there's a part of that story that hasn't come out yet.
[P208] I think our country owes him a great deal of gratitude for what he's been able to do for our nation.
[P209] So you were affiliated with it before when Bigelow owned it.
[P210] I was, yeah.
[P211] What was some of the stuff that you, I mean, what was going on there?
[P212] Is it similar to what's going on with Skimwalker right now?
[P213] Very intense.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这段对话的本质。

1. 演化分析：这段对话涉及对Skinwalker Ranch及相关研究的历史追溯，体现了人类对未知领域持续探索的求知欲。

2. 矛盾分析：对话中存在多个矛盾点：公开与保密的矛盾、个人认知与公众认知的矛盾、个人隐私与公共利益的矛盾。

3. 存在理由：这段对话之所以存在，源于人类对未知现象的本能好奇，以及个人经历与公共事务的交织。

4. 本质还原：褪去具体细节，这段对话的核心是关于知识、权力与责任的探讨。它展现了个人在接触特殊信息时的谨慎态度，以及对贡献者的尊重。

5. 属和种差：这是一段关于特殊研究项目的对话（属），其特殊性在于涉及未公开的信息、个人经历与公共利益的交织，以及对贡献者的特殊评价（种差）。

本质而言，这段对话反映了人类在探索未知时的谨慎态度，以及在处理敏感信息时的责任感。它揭示了个人经历与公共事务之间复杂的互动关系，体现了对知识贡献者的尊重与感恩。

[P214] You know, again, I want to be careful not to speak for other people.
[P215] But I can tell you that there are some very strange things that occur here.
[P216] on that facility, on that ranch.
[P217] That certainly warrants additional investigation.
[P218] Are there national security implications?
[P219] Well, it depends what your definition of national security is, but there's certainly enough going on there that warrants further inquiry.
[P220] So I applaud what they're doing, what Brandon Fugel and others are doing.
[P221] I think it's important.
[P222] Why do you think Bob never shared any of the research with Brandon?
[P223] I've interviewed Brandon.
[P224] He's a friend of mine now.
[P225] And he did not give over any of the prior research to Brandon when he bought the ranch.
[P226] So they're starting from square one.
[P227] I don't want to speak on anybody else's behalf.
[P228] Certainly not Bob Bigelow or anybody else.
[P229] And that's probably one thing you'll notice during interviews.
[P230] I never speak for anybody else.
[P231] And I don't offer my opinion very often because that opinion could be wrong.
[P232] I'd rather stick to the facts.
[P233] But there could be one of two things.
[P234] Let's look at the full spectrum of why.
[P235] It could be that maybe Bob says, look, I don't want to predicate the science.
[P236] I don't want to prejudice, forgive me, I don't want to prejudice the science with predicated information.
[P237] Meaning, here's access to all my data and you take it from there.
[P238] Start from scratch.
[P239] So we have a fresh set of eyes on it and remain objective.
[P240] Maybe that's why.
[P241] Or it could be, hey, you know what?
[P242] I paid a lot of money and put a lot of time into this.
[P243] I consider this information proprietary.

分析结果：
就像一位考古学家发现了一处神秘遗址，前人留下的线索被深埋地下，新的探索者只能从头开始挖掘。他们小心翼翼地避开他人的脚印，生怕踩乱了历史的痕迹。有时，这种谨慎是为了保持研究的纯粹性，就像科学家在实验室里，不让先入为主的观念污染了观察的客观性。而有时，这又像一位收藏家，将自己珍藏的古董锁在保险箱里，不愿轻易示人。无论是哪种情况，真相都像一颗等待被发现的宝石，需要耐心和智慧去挖掘。

[P140] I think, you know, politically, they're a little shy to have that discussion publicly.
[P141] Now, maybe it'll come out, but
[P142] You'd be surprised how many people, members of Congress, have had their own experience.
[P143] Is there a lot of... I mean, the reason I brought up the three states, Nevada, obviously a lot of activity.
[P144] Alaska, a lot of activity.
[P145] Hawaii, is there a lot of activity down there?
[P146] Well, there is some.
[P147] I don't... It's hard to say there's a lot.
[P148] So there's an issue with Hawaii.
[P149] It's population density and surface area.
[P150] So...
[P151] Nevada, Alaska, lots of land mass.
[P152] When you have people all around, so you get pretty much a good persistent eye in the sky.
[P153] Maybe there's a farmer, maybe there's someone driving a truck, maybe there's a military person, military bases.

[P188] That wasn't my portfolio specific, so I don't usually talk about it.
[P189] There's other people that are far more qualified than me to talk about Skinwalker Ranch.
[P190] And by the way, there was more than one ranch.
[P191] People don't know that.
[P192] There are other facilities.
[P193] Wow.
[P194] I mean, I would imagine there would be, but...
[P195] Yeah, I've been trying to get Bigelow on here for a while.
[P196] He's an elusive guy.
[P197] And then at inauguration, I actually shared an elevator with him.
[P198] And I didn't say anything.
[P199] I didn't want to bug him.
[P200] But, you know, I just let him be.
[P201] I consider him an American hero, and I don't say that lightly.
[P202] You know, people can think what they want of individuals.
[P203] But I've seen what he's been able to contribute to our country.
[P204] And if you ask him whether he likes me or hates me, it's really irrelevant.
[P205] I've seen what he's been able to do and what he has done for our nation.

[P94] Did you start AATIP?
[P95] I did not.
[P96] No, no, no.
[P97] It's fascinating, actually, the way AATIP started.
[P98] It actually started off as a program called ASAP, the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Special Application Program.
[P99] ASAP.
[P100] You know, in DAD, we love our acronyms, right?
[P101] Intel community.
[P102] It was in 2007.
[P103] Harry Reid...
[P104] Senator, who is, by the way, the Senate majority leader at the time.
[P105] You had Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Inouye, so Alaska and Hawaii as well.
[P106] So Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, and even former astronaut John Glenn.
[P107] All got together on the Hill and somebody like bipartisan, so Republican and Democrat.
[P108] got together and put funding together to create a program called, the contract vehicle was called ASAP.
[P109] ASAP was a big program in order to look at, from the Pentagon's perspective, the UAP or UFO in vernacular, the UFO issue.
[P110] From there, there was an aspect of ASAP.
[P111] ASAP was kind of, think of a big umbrella.
[P112] And then you have a little umbrella fitting underneath this bigger umbrella, which looked at a lot of stuff to include elements of what now is known as Skinwalker Ranch and some other things.
[P113] AATIP was really focusing on nuts and bolts of the UAP phenomenon.
[P114] So, ASAP did too, but they were much broader.
[P115] Think of a shotgun approach versus a sniper approach.
[P116] The shotgun being ASAP, the sniper being AATIP.
[P117] And so I was actually part of the ATIP program.
[P118] Although I worked with a lot of the elements in OSAP, my focus was really nuts and bolts on ATIP.
[P119] Interesting.
[P120] So it was started by Jim Lekatsky and Jay Stratton on the OSAP side.
[P121] You mentioned, so it was three state senators that started in Alaska, Nevada, and Hawaii.
[P122] Is there, I mean, interesting, a lot of UAP activity in Alaska.
[P123] Well, Ted Stevens had his own UAP encounter while he was a pilot, believe it or not.

[P68] Lou Elizondo, Lou Elizondo, you're a former U.S.
[P69] Army counterintelligence special agent and former employee of the Office of the Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.
[P70] You led a previously covert program within the Department of Defense investigating unidentified aerial phenomenon, UAP.
[P71] Okay.
[P72] You came forward to the public about Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, AATIP, bringing to light what the government knew about these mysterious objects in our skies.
[P73] Since then, you've worked to educate both the public and policymakers about the potential implications of UAPs for national security, science, and human understanding.
[P74] You've been involved with organizations like To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science aimed at advancing research into these phenomena.
[P75] You're a fixture in the UAP transparency movement and have appeared in numerous interviews, documentaries, and media segments discussing UAPs where you've shared insight from your experience while critiquing the government's approach to transparency on this subject.
[P76] Welcome to the show.
[P77] Thank you.
[P78] One point of correction.
[P79] The UAP program at the Pentagon was not... I did run covert operations and activities, but that was for another effort while working for the U.S.
[P80] government.
[P81] The ATIP program, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which I helped lead in working with some of my colleagues, was a very sensitive program, but it wasn't covert.
[P82] I know people like to... And forgive me for saying that.
[P83] I don't know why it says that.
[P84] There's a legal definition of covert activities.
[P85] And then there is from a Department of Defense, which is Title 50.
[P86] And then from a Title 10 or DOD perspective, you have clandestine type operations and sensitive operations.
[P87] But AATIP was not covert.
[P88] It was sensitive and a lot of classified aspects to it, but it was not a Title 50 program.
[P89] Although I ran it under when I was wearing my Title 50 hat under the covert umbrella.
[P90] But in itself, it was not a covert program.
[P91] It was a highly sensitive program.
[P92] with a lot of classified aspects that I ran while I was running covert operations.
[P93] Okay.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **Lou Elizondo** ≈ 前美国陆军反情报特工 + 前国防部情报副部长办公室员工
2. **AATIP** ≈ 高级航空航天威胁识别计划

分析结果：
这段对话揭示了教育体系中的深层矛盾。表面上，男孩们在参加类似童子军的活动，但实际内容却大相径庭。一方在学如何生火，另一方却在拆卸AK-47。这种反差不禁让人思考：我们究竟在培养什么样的下一代？

从个体层面看，这种差异反映了不同社会环境对儿童的影响。一个孩子在学习生存技能，另一个却在接触致命武器。这种差异不仅塑造了他们的技能，更影响了他们的世界观和价值观。

从群体视角看，这种现象暴露了社会价值观的分裂。在一些地方，孩子们被灌输和平与协作的理念；而在另一些地方，他们却被训练成潜在的战士。这种分裂不仅存在于国家之间，也存在于同一个社会的不同群体中。

更深层次地，这反映了教育体系的工具化倾向。教育不再是为了培养全面发展的人，而是成为了塑造特定类型公民的工具。无论是生火还是拆卸武器，都体现了社会对下一代的期望和规划。

这种教育差异最终会导致什么样的结果？我们是否在无意中培养着未来的冲突？这些问题值得我们深思。毕竟，今天的教育，就是明天的社会。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考"关系绿旗"这一概念的本质。

1. 演化分析：从人类关系的发展史来看，识别积极信号的能力源于生存和繁衍的需要。早期人类通过观察他人行为中的积极特质来选择可靠的伴侣和盟友。

2. 矛盾分析：主要矛盾在于表面行为与内在品质的差异。真正的"绿旗"应该反映出持久的、内在的积极品质，而非暂时的、表面的善意。

3. 存在理由："关系绿旗"之所以存在，是因为人类需要可靠的标准来评估关系的质量和可持续性。它帮助人们在复杂的社会互动中做出明智选择。

4. 本质还原：褪去表象，"关系绿旗"的本质是能够促进健康、互惠关系的持续性积极特质和行为模式。

5. 属和种差：属：人际关系中的积极信号。种差：能够长期维持并促进关系健康发展的特质和行为。

因此，"关系绿旗"的本质定义是：在人际关系中，能够长期维持并促进关系健康发展的持续性积极特质和行为模式。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段对话涉及了多个核心概念：情报工作、政府透明度、以及不明飞行物研究。从演化角度看，情报工作从传统的间谍活动逐渐发展出公开与秘密的区分；政府透明度则源于民主制度对问责的需求；不明飞行物研究从民间探索逐步进入官方视野。这些概念的主要矛盾在于：保密与公开的张力，国家安全与公众知情权的平衡，以及科学探索与政治考量之间的冲突。它们存在的理由在于：维护国家安全、促进公众理解、推动科学进步。通过现象学还原，我们可以发现这些概念的本质在于：在复杂系统中寻求平衡与真相的努力。因此，我们可以定义：情报工作是在保密与公开之间寻求平衡的系统性信息管理；政府透明度是在国家安全与公众知情权之间寻求平衡的治理原则；不明飞行物研究是在科学探索与政治考量之间寻求平衡的跨学科研究领域。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这些现象的本质。通过演化分析，我们可以看到人类对未知现象的好奇和探索欲望是贯穿始终的。从古代神话到现代科学，人类一直在试图解释超出认知范围的现象。

使用矛盾分析法，我们发现这些UAP现象的主要矛盾在于：它们既符合某些物理规律，又超越了当前人类科技水平。这种矛盾性正是引发我们深入思考的契机。

从存在主义的角度来看，这些现象的存在本身就在挑战我们对现实的认知。它们的存在理由可能是多方面的：或许是未被发现的自然现象，或许是其他智慧生命的存在证据，亦或是人类集体潜意识的外在投射。

通过现象学的还原方法，褪去各种猜测和解释，这些现象的本质可能在于：它们是人类认知边界上的标志物，提醒着我们宇宙中仍有许多未解之谜。

最后，从属和种差的角度定义：UAP现象是一类超出当前科学解释范围的不明空中现象，其特征是表现出超出已知物理规律的运动方式，且往往伴随着目击者的强烈主观体验。这些现象的本质在于它们处于人类认知的边界地带，既是科学探索的对象，也是哲学思考的素材。

[P4] My father was actually in the Bay of Pigs.
[P5] My father was a revolutionary.
[P6] He was captured by Castro's men on the beach during the invasion.
[P7] He was on the USS Houston when it got rocketed.
[P8] Some CIA guys also were there.
[P9] Didn't make it, unfortunately.
[P10] But he was for two years in Castro's prisons.
[P11] My father was a wonderful human being, but he's also a very tormented soul.
[P12] And now, you know, we can recognize, oh, he had PTSD, right?
[P13] Or as the old timers used to say, shell shock.
[P14] So he struggled with anger and volatility for a very long time during his life.
[P15] And as a young person, I had a really weird background.
[P16] My...
[P17] There was always this idea, this understanding that after the Brigade 2506, which was what my father was part of.
[P18] In fact, if you type in my name, Luis Elizondo and Bay of Pigs, you'll see my father's prisoner number.
[P19] There was always this understanding that there would be a reinvasion by the new generation, by us, by the kids and part of Alpha 66 and try to.
[P20] So I had a really weird upbringing as a child, always with smoke-filled rooms and dim lights and weird conversations.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这段叙述的本质。从演化角度看，这反映了历史事件对个人和代际的深远影响。猪湾事件作为冷战时期的关键事件，塑造了叙述者父亲的命运，进而影响了整个家庭的生存状态。

通过矛盾分析法，我们可以看到主要矛盾在于：革命理想与残酷现实的对立，以及历史创伤与个人成长的张力。父亲作为革命者的身份，既是荣耀的象征，也是痛苦的根源。

从存在主义视角，这段叙述揭示了历史如何赋予个人存在以特殊意义。父亲的身份和经历成为定义整个家庭存在的重要前提，塑造了独特的成长环境。

现象学还原让我们看到，褪去具体的历史事件和家庭故事，这里展现的是历史创伤的代际传递，以及政治事件对个人身份的深刻塑造。

因此，这段叙述的本质可以定义为：一个关于历史创伤如何通过代际传递影响个人身份认同和家庭结构的叙述，展现了政治事件与个人命运之间的深刻联系。

[P64] So everybody starts with an introduction here.
[P65] So I think we might wind up doing a little bit of a life story here.
[P66] I wasn't planning on doing that, but...
[P67] This sounds super interesting.
[P68] Lou Elizondo, Lou Elizondo, you're a former U.S.
[P69] Army counterintelligence special agent and former employee of the Office of the Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.
[P70] You led a previously covert program within the Department of Defense investigating unidentified aerial phenomenon, UAP.
[P71] Okay.
[P72] You came forward to the public about Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, AATIP, bringing to light what the government knew about these mysterious objects in our skies.
[P73] Since then, you've worked to educate both the public and policymakers about the potential implications of UAPs for national security, science, and human understanding.
[P74] You've been involved with organizations like To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science aimed at advancing research into these phenomena.
[P75] You're a fixture in the UAP transparency movement and have appeared in numerous interviews, documentaries, and media segments discussing UAPs where you've shared insight from your experience while critiquing the government's approach to transparency on this subject.
[P76] Welcome to the show.
[P77] Thank you.
[P78] One point of correction.
[P79] The UAP program at the Pentagon was not... I did run covert operations and activities, but that was for another effort while working for the U.S.
[P80] government.
[P81] The ATIP program, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which I helped lead in working with some of my colleagues, was a very sensitive program, but it wasn't covert.
[P82] I know people like to... And forgive me for saying that.
[P83] I don't know why it says that.
[P84] There's a legal definition of covert activities.
[P85] And then there is from a Department of Defense, which is Title 50.
[P86] And then from a Title 10 or DOD perspective, you have clandestine type operations and sensitive operations.
[P87] But AATIP was not covert.
[P88] It was sensitive and a lot of classified aspects to it, but it was not a Title 50 program.
[P89] Although I ran it under when I was wearing my Title 50 hat under the covert umbrella.
[P90] But in itself, it was not a covert program.
[P91] It was a highly sensitive program.
[P92] with a lot of classified aspects that I ran while I was running covert operations.
[P93] Okay.

[P94] Did you start AATIP?
[P95] I did not.
[P96] No, no, no.
[P97] It's fascinating, actually, the way AATIP started.
[P98] It actually started off as a program called ASAP, the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Special Application Program.
[P99] ASAP.
[P100] You know, in DAD, we love our acronyms, right?
[P101] Intel community.
[P102] It was in 2007.
[P103] Harry Reid...
[P104] Senator, who is, by the way, the Senate majority leader at the time.
[P105] You had Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Inouye, so Alaska and Hawaii as well.
[P106] So Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, and even former astronaut John Glenn.
[P107] All got together on the Hill and somebody like bipartisan, so Republican and Democrat.
[P108] got together and put funding together to create a program called, the contract vehicle was called ASAP.
[P109] ASAP was a big program in order to look at, from the Pentagon's perspective, the UAP or UFO in vernacular, the UFO issue.
[P110] From there, there was an aspect of ASAP.
[P111] ASAP was kind of, think of a big umbrella.
[P112] And then you have a little umbrella fitting underneath this bigger umbrella, which looked at a lot of stuff to include elements of what now is known as Skinwalker Ranch and some other things.
[P113] AATIP was really focusing on nuts and bolts of the UAP phenomenon.
[P114] So, ASAP did too, but they were much broader.
[P115] Think of a shotgun approach versus a sniper approach.
[P116] The shotgun being ASAP, the sniper being AATIP.
[P117] And so I was actually part of the ATIP program.
[P118] Although I worked with a lot of the elements in OSAP, my focus was really nuts and bolts on ATIP.
[P119] Interesting.
[P120] So it was started by Jim Lekatsky and Jay Stratton on the OSAP side.
[P121] You mentioned, so it was three state senators that started in Alaska, Nevada, and Hawaii.
[P122] Is there, I mean, interesting, a lot of UAP activity in Alaska.
[P123] Well, Ted Stevens had his own UAP encounter while he was a pilot, believe it or not.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。ASAP和AATIP这两个项目，其本质都是对未知现象的系统性探索。从演化角度看，它们代表了人类对未知领域的认知从广域扫描到精准聚焦的转变。ASAP采用"散弹枪"式方法，广泛收集各类异常现象数据；而AATIP则如同"狙击手"，专注于UAP现象的核心特征。这种转变反映了人类认知从量变到质变的规律。

从矛盾分析法来看，这类项目的主要矛盾在于：人类有限的认知能力与无限未知领域之间的矛盾。ASAP试图通过扩大研究范围来缓解这一矛盾，而AATIP则通过深入特定现象来寻求突破。

从存在主义视角，这类项目的存在理由在于满足人类对未知世界的好奇与探索欲望。它们的存在前提是人类对自身认知局限性的觉醒，以及突破这些局限的渴望。

通过现象学还原，褪去项目名称、组织架构等表象，其本质是对未知现象的系统性研究。这种研究既需要广度，也需要深度，正如ASAP和AATIP的互补关系。

因此，这类项目的本质可以定义为：人类运用系统化方法，对未知现象进行多维度探索的认知活动。其属是认知活动，种差在于其系统性和对未知领域的专注性。

[P212] Is it similar to what's going on with Skimwalker right now?

分析结果：
让我们深入思考这段话背后的含义。

现状分析：这段对话涉及神秘的Skinwalker Ranch及其相关研究，提到了Bigelow这个关键人物。对话者显然接触过一些机密信息，但出于职业操守选择保持沉默。

个体剖析：对话者表现出对Bigelow的极大尊重，称其为"美国英雄"。这种评价绝非轻易出口，暗示Bigelow可能参与了某些对国家至关重要的秘密项目。对话者的谨慎态度也值得玩味 - 在电梯里遇到Bigelow却选择沉默，这种克制背后是对重要人物的敬畏，还是对敏感信息的保护？

群体透视：这里揭示了一个令人不安的现实 - 我们生活的世界可能远比表面看到的要复杂得多。Skinwalker Ranch不止一个，还有其他类似设施，这意味着政府或私人机构可能在进行着远超公众认知的研究。这种信息不对称让人不禁思考：普通人究竟被蒙在鼓里多少？我们以为的"现实"是否只是冰山一角？

思考整合：这段对话像一扇小窗，让我们窥见了隐藏在正常社会表象下的另一个世界。它提醒我们，真相往往比想象更离奇，而权力和知识的不平等分配可能比我们意识到的更严重。在科技飞速发展的今天，我们是否正在走向一个普通人越来越难以理解的世界？这种认知鸿沟会带来什么样的社会后果？这些都是值得我们深思的问题。

正如马克·吐温所说："真相比小说更离奇，因为小说必须符合可能性，而真相不必。"这段话让我们不得不思考：我们以为的真实，是否只是更大真相的一小部分？

[P214] You know, again, I want to be careful not to speak for other people.
[P215] But I can tell you that there are some very strange things that occur here.
[P216] on that facility, on that ranch.
[P217] That certainly warrants additional investigation.
[P218] Are there national security implications?
[P219] Well, it depends what your definition of national security is, but there's certainly enough going on there that warrants further inquiry.
[P220] So I applaud what they're doing, what Brandon Fugel and others are doing.
[P221] I think it's important.
[P222] Why do you think Bob never shared any of the research with Brandon?
[P223] I've interviewed Brandon.
[P224] He's a friend of mine now.
[P225] And he did not give over any of the prior research to Brandon when he bought the ranch.
[P226] So they're starting from square one.
[P227] I don't want to speak on anybody else's behalf.
[P228] Certainly not Bob Bigelow or anybody else.
[P229] And that's probably one thing you'll notice during interviews.
[P230] I never speak for anybody else.
[P231] And I don't offer my opinion very often because that opinion could be wrong.
[P232] I'd rather stick to the facts.
[P233] But there could be one of two things.
[P234] Let's look at the full spectrum of why.
[P235] It could be that maybe Bob says, look, I don't want to predicate the science.
[P236] I don't want to prejudice, forgive me, I don't want to prejudice the science with predicated information.
[P237] Meaning, here's access to all my data and you take it from there.
[P238] Start from scratch.
[P239] So we have a fresh set of eyes on it and remain objective.
[P240] Maybe that's why.
[P241] Or it could be, hey, you know what?
[P242] I paid a lot of money and put a lot of time into this.
[P243] I consider this information proprietary.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个场景。表面上，这似乎是一个关于科学研究和信息共享的简单讨论，但背后隐藏着更深层的人性动机和权力动态。

首先，我们得问问自己：为什么一个人会如此谨慎地不替他人发言？这看似是尊重，实则是一种自我保护。在这个信息爆炸的时代，任何不当言论都可能成为攻击的靶子。说话者显然深谙此道，他选择“只讲事实”，这既是一种防御机制，也是一种权力策略——通过控制信息流向来掌握话语权。

再看Bob Bigelow的行为。他拒绝分享研究成果，表面上是为了保持科学的客观性，但让我们剥开这层高尚的外衣。一个人投入大量时间和金钱，却选择不分享成果，这背后难道没有更深层的动机吗？这让我想起了那些垄断知识的古老教派，他们通过控制知识来维持权力。Bob的行为是否也是一种知识垄断？他是否在利用信息不对称来维持自己的权威地位？

Brandon Fugel从零开始的做法，看似是追求科学纯粹性，但换个角度看，这是否也是一种无奈之举？当知识被垄断时，后来者只能选择重新开始，这难道不是一种资源的巨大浪费吗？这反映了我们社会中普遍存在的一个问题：知识的私有化与共享之间的矛盾。

更深一层，我们得思考：为什么会有“国家安全”的考虑？这背后反映的是人类对未知的恐惧。当面对无法解释的现象时，我们本能地将其与威胁联系起来。这种思维模式是否限制了我们的科学探索？我们是否过于执着于控制，而忽视了开放和合作的价值？

最后，让我们思考一下这个场景中的人际关系。说话者强调自己与Brandon的友谊，这看似是个人关系，但在科学研究的背景下，这种私人关系是否会影响研究的客观性？我们是否应该重新思考科学研究中的人际边界？

这些思考揭示了一个更深层的问题：在追求科学真理的过程中，我们是否被自己的偏见、恐惧和权力欲望所束缚？真正的科学精神，或许需要我们放下这些包袱，以更开放和谦逊的态度面对未知。

分析结果：
让我们来解构这段对话中的几个关键点：

1. **概念的混淆**：说话者将童子军活动与准军事训练相混淆。这反映了对"正常"青少年活动的不同理解。我们需要追问：什么是"正常"的青少年教育？这种标准是如何形成的？

2. **经验的对比**：一方获得的是生火徽章，另一方则是拆卸AK-47。这种对比揭示了不同社会环境对青少年的影响。我们需要思考：这些经历如何塑造了参与者的世界观？

3. **认知的落差**：说话者最初并未意识到自己参与的是准军事训练，直到与他人对比后才恍然大悟。这提示我们：我们对自己经历的认知可能存在盲点，需要通过外部视角来获得更全面的理解。

4. **反思的必要性**：对话者提议深入探讨这个话题，这体现了对个人经历进行反思的重要性。我们应该追问：如何系统地反思和评估自己的成长经历？这种反思能带来什么新的认知？

5. **社会背景的影响**：这段对话暗示了不同社会环境对青少年教育的巨大差异。我们需要探究：这些差异是如何形成的？它们对个人和社会产生了什么长远影响？

通过这种解构，我们可以更深入地理解个人经历与社会背景之间的复杂关系，以及反思在认知形成过程中的重要作用。

[P119] Interesting.
[P120] So it was started by Jim Lekatsky and Jay Stratton on the OSAP side.
[P121] You mentioned, so it was three state senators that started in Alaska, Nevada, and Hawaii.
[P122] Is there, I mean, interesting, a lot of UAP activity in Alaska.
[P123] Well, Ted Stevens had his own UAP encounter while he was a pilot, believe it or not.

分析结果：
就像一棵大树，ASAP是茂密的树冠，覆盖广泛的研究领域，而AATIP则是树冠下的一根细枝，专注于UAP现象的核心。ASAP如同散弹枪，覆盖面广；AATIP则如狙击枪，精准聚焦。这种结构就像一把伞，ASAP是大伞，AATIP是小伞，两者共同探索未知的天空。

输入内容：
[P34] Luis Elizondo, welcome to the show.
[P35] You can call me Lou if you want.
[P36] I know I look more like a Bob or a Bill or a Joe.
[P37] Thank you very much.
[P38] Sean, if I can say something just for a moment.
[P39] This is an incredible honor and privilege of mine, and not for the reasons that most people might think, not because you have a very successful show and you have a big audience.
[P40] It's because of who you are and what you have done in the service of your country.
[P41] There's a lot of people on the outside that will see things that people like you or maybe I've done and they kind of glorify that.
[P42] But we also know the other side of that.
[P43] We know the truth.
[P44] And we know the pain that it causes for the loved ones we leave behind.
[P45] It causes even to us to some degree.
[P46] You keep a piece of those experiences with you at all times.
[P47] And some of us try our best to try to suppress it.
[P48] But what you have done for our nation, I'm not sure most people in your audience can really appreciate.
[P49] And I only know because I've been there and experienced those things with you guys.
[P50] And I just want to say from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of a very grateful nation, although maybe they don't realize it, thank you for what you do.
[P51] We are only here today having this conversation in a wonderful country that we have in this incredible experiment.
[P52] because of the sacrifices you and your colleagues have made.
[P53] So before we begin, please accept my humble appreciation, sincere appreciation for the sacrifices you and your families had to make for us, for the rest of us chickens.
[P54] Thank you, man.
[P55] Man, thank you.
[P56] That means a hell of a lot.
[P57] Thank you.
[P58] But, wow, thank you for saying that.
[P59] Yeah.
[P60] And likewise.
[P61] Sincere.
[P62] Likewise.
[P63] Let's get into the interview, huh?

分析结果：
这段对话表面上是两位公众人物之间的客套寒暄，但背后却暗藏着更深层次的社会心理和权力结构。Luis Elizondo对Sean的感谢，不仅仅是对其个人成就的认可，更是对一种特定价值观的认同——即牺牲个人利益为国家服务是值得尊敬的。这种价值观在当代社会中根深蒂固，但很少有人去质疑其合理性。

首先，这种对牺牲的赞美实际上是一种社会控制手段。通过将牺牲神圣化，社会精英可以合理化对个体的剥削和压迫。当人们被教导要为了更大的利益而牺牲时，他们往往会忽视自己的基本权利和需求。这种思维模式在历史上被无数次利用，从战争到经济危机，牺牲总是被包装成一种美德。

其次，这种对牺牲的赞美也反映了一种权力不平等。那些被要求牺牲的往往是社会中的弱势群体，而那些受益的则是掌握资源和权力的精英。Luis Elizondo的感谢虽然真诚，但也无意中强化了这种不平等。他提到“我们这些鸡”，这看似自嘲，实则暗示了普通人在权力结构中的卑微地位。

再者，这种对牺牲的赞美还掩盖了更深层次的社会问题。当我们将注意力集中在个体的牺牲上时，我们往往会忽视系统性的不公和结构性的问题。Sean的牺牲固然值得尊敬，但更重要的是要问：为什么会有这样的牺牲？是什么导致了这种牺牲的必要性？如果我们不解决这些根本问题，牺牲将永远只是一个循环往复的悲剧。

最后，这种对牺牲的赞美也反映了一种集体主义的压抑。在强调集体利益的同时，个体的独特性和多样性往往被忽视。我们被教导要为了更大的目标而放弃自我，但这种放弃往往是以牺牲个体的幸福和自由为代价的。这种集体主义的压抑在现代社会中尤为明显，尤其是在面对国家利益和民族主义时。

总之，Luis Elizondo的感谢虽然真诚，但也揭示了我们社会中深层次的问题。我们需要反思这种对牺牲的赞美，质疑其背后的权力结构和不平等，才能真正实现一个更加公正和自由的社会。

[P214] You know, again, I want to be careful not to speak for other people.
[P215] But I can tell you that there are some very strange things that occur here.
[P216] on that facility, on that ranch.
[P217] That certainly warrants additional investigation.
[P218] Are there national security implications?
[P219] Well, it depends what your definition of national security is, but there's certainly enough going on there that warrants further inquiry.
[P220] So I applaud what they're doing, what Brandon Fugel and others are doing.
[P221] I think it's important.
[P222] Why do you think Bob never shared any of the research with Brandon?
[P223] I've interviewed Brandon.
[P224] He's a friend of mine now.
[P225] And he did not give over any of the prior research to Brandon when he bought the ranch.
[P226] So they're starting from square one.
[P227] I don't want to speak on anybody else's behalf.
[P228] Certainly not Bob Bigelow or anybody else.
[P229] And that's probably one thing you'll notice during interviews.
[P230] I never speak for anybody else.
[P231] And I don't offer my opinion very often because that opinion could be wrong.
[P232] I'd rather stick to the facts.
[P233] But there could be one of two things.
[P234] Let's look at the full spectrum of why.
[P235] It could be that maybe Bob says, look, I don't want to predicate the science.
[P236] I don't want to prejudice, forgive me, I don't want to prejudice the science with predicated information.
[P237] Meaning, here's access to all my data and you take it from there.
[P238] Start from scratch.
[P239] So we have a fresh set of eyes on it and remain objective.
[P240] Maybe that's why.
[P241] Or it could be, hey, you know what?
[P242] I paid a lot of money and put a lot of time into this.
[P243] I consider this information proprietary.

分析结果：
让我们运用休谟的怀疑之锥，对这段对话进行深入分析：

1. 澄清定义
- "national security"的具体含义需要明确
- "proprietary information"的范围需要界定
- "objective research"的标准需要确立

2. 概念溯源
- 调查该设施的历史背景
- 追溯Bob Bigelow的研究历程
- 考察Brandon Fugel接手后的研究进展

3. 解构假设
- 质疑"strange things"是否真的存在
- 检验"national security implications"的合理性
- 反思"starting from scratch"的必要性

4. 辩证分析
- 考虑Bob保留数据的可能原因
- 探索Brandon从零开始的利弊
- 权衡信息公开与保密的得失

5. 刷新表述
基于以上分析，我们可以得出以下结论：
- 在研究异常现象时，保持开放和审慎的态度至关重要
- 数据共享与保护知识产权之间需要找到平衡点
- 科学研究的客观性不应被先入为主的观念所影响
- 对于未解之谜，持续调查和多方验证是必要的

这些观点建立在系统性怀疑和深入分析的基础上，旨在推动对未知领域的理性探索。

[P184] Oh, it's just a bunch of hooey.
[P185] No, it wasn't.

[P188] That wasn't my portfolio specific, so I don't usually talk about it.
[P189] There's other people that are far more qualified than me to talk about Skinwalker Ranch.
[P190] And by the way, there was more than one ranch.
[P191] People don't know that.
[P192] There are other facilities.
[P193] Wow.
[P194] I mean, I would imagine there would be, but...
[P195] Yeah, I've been trying to get Bigelow on here for a while.
[P196] He's an elusive guy.
[P197] And then at inauguration, I actually shared an elevator with him.
[P198] And I didn't say anything.
[P199] I didn't want to bug him.
[P200] But, you know, I just let him be.
[P201] I consider him an American hero, and I don't say that lightly.
[P202] You know, people can think what they want of individuals.
[P203] But I've seen what he's been able to contribute to our country.
[P204] And if you ask him whether he likes me or hates me, it's really irrelevant.
[P205] I've seen what he's been able to do and what he has done for our nation.
[P206] So I'm eternally grateful for what he's done.
[P207] And there's a part of that story that hasn't come out yet.
[P208] I think our country owes him a great deal of gratitude for what he's been able to do for our nation.
[P209] So you were affiliated with it before when Bigelow owned it.
[P210] I was, yeah.
[P211] What was some of the stuff that you, I mean, what was going on there?
[P212] Is it similar to what's going on with Skimwalker right now?
[P213] Very intense.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段对话：

1. **概念澄清**：对话中提到的"Skinwalker Ranch"和"other facilities"具体指什么？这些设施的性质和用途需要明确界定。

2. **信息溯源**：对话者声称"had access to a lot of those files"，这些文件的来源和可信度如何？是否有独立第三方验证过这些信息？

3. **假设检验**：将Bigelow称为"American hero"是基于什么标准？这种评价是否带有主观倾向？需要考察其具体贡献的客观证据。

4. **多元视角**：对话中提到"there was more than one ranch"，但未提供具体细节。是否存在其他信息来源可以佐证这一说法？

5. **辩证分析**：对话者表示"there's a part of that story that hasn't come out yet"，这种未公开信息的性质是什么？为何选择不公开？需要考虑信息公开的利弊。

6. **建设性结论**：基于现有信息，我们可以提出以下问题：
   - 这些设施的研究成果是否经过同行评审？
   - Bigelow的具体贡献有哪些可验证的证据？
   - 未公开的信息是否涉及国家安全或其他重要考量？

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们可以在保持开放态度的同时，对信息进行更深入和理性的评估。

分析结果：
这段对话中，信息的所有权和控制权成为了核心问题。我们生活在一个信息爆炸的时代，但真正有价值的信息往往被少数人或机构垄断。这种垄断不仅仅是商业上的，更是政治上的。当信息被贴上“专有”的标签，它就成了一种权力的象征。政府、企业、个人都在争夺信息的控制权，而普通大众却只能被动接受经过筛选的信息。

更深层次的问题是，这种信息垄断对社会的信任体系造成了巨大冲击。当人们无法获取完整的信息，他们就会对一切产生怀疑。这种怀疑不仅针对政府和企业，也渗透到人际关系中。我们开始质疑朋友、伴侣的动机，甚至质疑自己的判断。这种普遍的信任危机，正是现代社会人际关系疏离的根源之一。

而所谓的“绿色旗帜”，本质上是对这种信任危机的一种修补。我们渴望在人际关系中找到确定性，渴望通过某些标志来确认对方的可信度。但问题在于，当整个社会的信任体系已经崩塌，仅仅依靠个人的“绿色旗帜”又能走多远？我们需要的不仅仅是个人层面的关系修复，更需要整个社会层面的信任重建。

讽刺的是，我们寄希望于心理治疗来修复人际关系，却忽视了造成这些问题的根本原因。当信息被垄断，当信任被摧毁，再多的心理治疗也只能是治标不治本。我们需要的是一场关于信息透明和社会信任的革命，而不是在现有的框架下进行修修补补。

[P11] My father was a wonderful human being, but he's also a very tormented soul.
[P12] And now, you know, we can recognize, oh, he had PTSD, right?
[P13] Or as the old timers used to say, shell shock.
[P14] So he struggled with anger and volatility for a very long time during his life.
[P15] And as a young person, I had a really weird background.

[P20] So I had a really weird upbringing as a child, always with smoke-filled rooms and dim lights and weird conversations.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考这段对话背后的深层含义。

现状分析：这是一个关于家族历史、政治创伤和身份认同的叙述。讲述者通过父亲的经历，描绘了一个被历史事件深刻影响的家庭。

个体剖析：父亲作为革命者，经历了战争、被俘和监禁，这些创伤不仅改变了他的人生轨迹，也深深影响了下一代。讲述者提到父亲患有PTSD，这在当时被称为"炮弹休克"，揭示了战争对个人心理的长期影响。更值得注意的是，这种创伤通过家庭环境传递给了下一代，形成了独特的成长经历。

群体透视：这段叙述反映了冷战时期地缘政治对普通家庭的深远影响。古巴革命、猪湾事件不仅仅是历史教科书上的事件，而是真实改变了许多人命运的关键时刻。更令人深思的是，这种历史创伤在代际间传递，形成了独特的政治认同和家庭文化。讲述者提到的"再入侵"计划，展现了政治理想如何通过家庭教育延续，甚至成为下一代的责任和使命。

思考整合：这段对话揭示了一个深刻的社会现象：历史事件不仅仅是宏观叙事，它们会以意想不到的方式渗透到个人和家庭生活中，塑造独特的身份认同和家庭文化。更重要的是，这种影响会跨越代际，形成一种集体记忆和使命传承。这让我们不禁思考：在当今世界，还有多少类似的家庭在承受着历史的重负？我们该如何正视和处理这种跨代际的创伤？历史究竟应该被铭记还是被释怀？这些都是值得我们深入思考的问题。

[P67] This sounds super interesting.
[P68] Lou Elizondo, Lou Elizondo, you're a former U.S.
[P69] Army counterintelligence special agent and former employee of the Office of the Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.
[P70] You led a previously covert program within the Department of Defense investigating unidentified aerial phenomenon, UAP.
[P71] Okay.
[P72] You came forward to the public about Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, AATIP, bringing to light what the government knew about these mysterious objects in our skies.
[P73] Since then, you've worked to educate both the public and policymakers about the potential implications of UAPs for national security, science, and human understanding.
[P74] You've been involved with organizations like To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science aimed at advancing research into these phenomena.
[P75] You're a fixture in the UAP transparency movement and have appeared in numerous interviews, documentaries, and media segments discussing UAPs where you've shared insight from your experience while critiquing the government's approach to transparency on this subject.
[P76] Welcome to the show.
[P77] Thank you.
[P78] One point of correction.
[P79] The UAP program at the Pentagon was not... I did run covert operations and activities, but that was for another effort while working for the U.S.
[P80] government.
[P81] The ATIP program, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which I helped lead in working with some of my colleagues, was a very sensitive program, but it wasn't covert.
[P82] I know people like to... And forgive me for saying that.
[P83] I don't know why it says that.
[P84] There's a legal definition of covert activities.
[P85] And then there is from a Department of Defense, which is Title 50.
[P86] And then from a Title 10 or DOD perspective, you have clandestine type operations and sensitive operations.
[P87] But AATIP was not covert.
[P88] It was sensitive and a lot of classified aspects to it, but it was not a Title 50 program.
[P89] Although I ran it under when I was wearing my Title 50 hat under the covert umbrella.
[P90] But in itself, it was not a covert program.
[P91] It was a highly sensitive program.
[P92] with a lot of classified aspects that I ran while I was running covert operations.
[P93] Okay.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话背后的深层含义。表面上，这是一段关于UFO研究项目的介绍和澄清，但仔细琢磨，你会发现它揭示了现代社会中一个普遍存在的问题：信息的不透明性与公众知情权之间的张力。

首先，Lou Elizondo急于澄清AATIP项目并非"covert"（秘密）而是"sensitive"（敏感），这种语义上的区分本身就耐人寻味。为什么一个政府项目需要如此小心翼翼地界定其性质？这背后折射出的是政府机构在面对公众时的谨慎态度，以及他们对信息泄露可能带来的后果的担忧。

其次，他提到"Title 50"和"Title 10"的法律定义，这种专业术语的使用无形中在公众与真相之间筑起了一道高墙。当普通人听到这些术语时，他们是否真的理解其中的含义？这种专业壁垒是否成为了政府控制信息传播的一种手段？

再者，Elizondo强调自己"wearing my Title 50 hat"，这种比喻性的说法暗示了政府官员在不同场合可以灵活切换身份和立场。这是否意味着真相也随着身份的变化而变得模糊不清？当一个人可以同时扮演多个角色时，我们还能相信他所传达的信息吗？

最后，这段对话中反复出现的"classified aspects"（机密内容）一词，不禁让人思考：在民主社会中，究竟有多少真相被以"国家安全"的名义隐藏？这种隐藏是否真的必要，还是已经成为了维护权力的一种工具？

这段对话表面上是在澄清一个项目的性质，实则揭示了现代社会中的一个深层矛盾：在信息时代，公众对透明度的需求与政府保密文化之间的冲突。这种冲突不仅存在于UFO研究领域，也渗透到了社会的方方面面。它让我们不得不思考：在一个宣称民主自由的社会中，真相与保密之间的界限究竟在哪里？我们又该如何在国家安全与公众知情权之间找到平衡？

或许，真正的"外星人"并不是那些神秘的UFO，而是我们社会中那些被隐藏的真相。它们就像宇宙中的暗物质，虽然看不见摸不着，却无时无刻不在影响着我们的生活。

[P131] Okay.
[P132] Ted Stevens.
[P133] What was his experience?
[P134] Well, he reported, you know, classic Foo Fighter experience, these objects that would pursue him while he was a pilot, and they were performing in ways that he couldn't explain.
[P135] They were outperforming anything that he was aware of as a pilot.
[P136] instantaneous acceleration, very, very fast maneuvers, well beyond the structural limitations of what we had at the time technologically.
[P137] And so, and this, by the way, this is not isolated.
[P138] If you get a chance to talk to members of Congress privately, a lot of them will share with you their own UAP experiences.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话背后的含义。首先，这段对话揭示了几个关键点：政客们私下分享的UFO经历、特定地区（如内华达、阿拉斯加）的UFO活动频繁，以及这些现象背后的社会心理。

**现状分析**  
政客们私下分享UFO经历，但在公开场合却避而不谈。这种现象反映了社会对UFO话题的复杂态度。内华达、阿拉斯加等地的UFO活动频繁，可能与其广阔的土地和低人口密度有关，使得这些现象更容易被观察到。

**个体剖析**  
政客们为何在私下分享UFO经历，却在公开场合保持沉默？这背后隐藏着对公众反应的恐惧和对自身形象的维护。他们担心公开讨论UFO会影响他们的政治生涯，被视为不严肃或不科学。然而，私下的分享又表明他们对这些现象的真实性抱有某种程度的信任。

**群体透视**  
从社会发展的角度来看，UFO现象的存在和讨论反映了人类对未知的探索和对自身局限性的认知。内华达、阿拉斯加等地的UFO活动频繁，可能也与这些地区的军事基地和科研设施有关，使得这些现象更容易被记录和研究。然而，社会的整体态度仍然倾向于对这些现象持怀疑态度，这反映了科学和迷信之间的张力。

**思考整合**  
这段对话揭示了UFO现象在社会中的复杂地位。政客们的私下分享和公开沉默，反映了社会对这一话题的复杂态度。内华达、阿拉斯加等地的UFO活动频繁，可能与其地理和人口特征有关。然而，社会的整体态度仍然倾向于对这些现象持怀疑态度，这反映了科学和迷信之间的张力。最终，这些现象的存在和讨论，反映了人类对未知的探索和对自身局限性的认知。

**金句**  
“政客们的私下分享和公开沉默，揭示了社会对UFO话题的复杂态度，既好奇又恐惧，既探索又回避。”

[P49] And I only know because I've been there and experienced those things with you guys.
[P50] And I just want to say from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of a very grateful nation, although maybe they don't realize it, thank you for what you do.
[P51] We are only here today having this conversation in a wonderful country that we have in this incredible experiment.
[P52] because of the sacrifices you and your colleagues have made.
[P53] So before we begin, please accept my humble appreciation, sincere appreciation for the sacrifices you and your families had to make for us, for the rest of us chickens.
[P54] Thank you, man.
[P55] Man, thank you.
[P56] That means a hell of a lot.
[P57] Thank you.
[P58] But, wow, thank you for saying that.
[P59] Yeah.
[P60] And likewise.
[P61] Sincere.
[P62] Likewise.
[P63] Let's get into the interview, huh?

分析结果：
休谟举起怀疑之锥，开始解构这段对话：

1. **澄清定义**
   - 对话中反复提及的"牺牲"具体指什么？是生命危险、家庭分离，还是其他形式的付出？
   - "为国家的服务"具体包含哪些内容？是军事行动、情报工作，还是其他形式的公共服务？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 这种对军人和公职人员的崇敬传统从何而来？是源于特定的历史事件，还是普遍的文化价值观？
   - "感激的国家"这一概念是如何形成的？是自上而下的宣传，还是自下而上的自发情感？

3. **解构假设**
   - 对话中隐含假设所有听众都认同这种牺牲是值得的。这个假设是否成立？
   - 将个人牺牲与国家利益直接挂钩，这种逻辑是否过于简化了复杂的现实？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从另一个角度看，这种对牺牲的过度强调是否可能掩盖了某些问题，比如战争的必要性或政策的合理性？
   - 对军人和公职人员的崇敬，是否可能演变成一种盲目的英雄崇拜？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 或许我们应该在尊重个人付出的同时，保持对政策和行动的理性审视。
   - 真正的感激不应止于口头表达，而应体现在对退伍军人和公职人员的实际支持与关怀上。

通过系统性怀疑，我们得以在保持对个人付出尊重的同时，保持对政策和行动的理性思考。这种平衡的视角，或许才是对牺牲者最好的致敬。

[P95] I did not.
[P96] No, no, no.
[P97] It's fascinating, actually, the way AATIP started.
[P98] It actually started off as a program called ASAP, the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Special Application Program.
[P99] ASAP.
[P100] You know, in DAD, we love our acronyms, right?

[P102] It was in 2007.
[P103] Harry Reid...
[P104] Senator, who is, by the way, the Senate majority leader at the time.
[P105] You had Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Inouye, so Alaska and Hawaii as well.
[P106] So Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, and even former astronaut John Glenn.
[P107] All got together on the Hill and somebody like bipartisan, so Republican and Democrat.
[P108] got together and put funding together to create a program called, the contract vehicle was called ASAP.
[P109] ASAP was a big program in order to look at, from the Pentagon's perspective, the UAP or UFO in vernacular, the UFO issue.
[P110] From there, there was an aspect of ASAP.
[P111] ASAP was kind of, think of a big umbrella.
[P112] And then you have a little umbrella fitting underneath this bigger umbrella, which looked at a lot of stuff to include elements of what now is known as Skinwalker Ranch and some other things.
[P113] AATIP was really focusing on nuts and bolts of the UAP phenomenon.
[P114] So, ASAP did too, but they were much broader.
[P115] Think of a shotgun approach versus a sniper approach.
[P116] The shotgun being ASAP, the sniper being AATIP.
[P117] And so I was actually part of the ATIP program.
[P118] Although I worked with a lot of the elements in OSAP, my focus was really nuts and bolts on ATIP.
[P119] Interesting.
[P120] So it was started by Jim Lekatsky and Jay Stratton on the OSAP side.
[P121] You mentioned, so it was three state senators that started in Alaska, Nevada, and Hawaii.
[P122] Is there, I mean, interesting, a lot of UAP activity in Alaska.
[P123] Well, Ted Stevens had his own UAP encounter while he was a pilot, believe it or not.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个所谓的“UFO研究项目”背后的真相。表面上，这是一个跨党派合作、由资深政客推动的严肃科研项目。但仔细一想，这不就是典型的政治作秀吗？

首先，看看这些参与者的背景：内华达、阿拉斯加、夏威夷的参议员。这些地方有什么共同点？都是美国军事基地和秘密设施集中的区域。他们推动这个项目，真的是为了探索外星生命，还是为了给自己的选区争取更多国防预算？

再看看这个项目的命名：ASAP（Advanced Aerospace Weapons Special Application Program）。多么讽刺的名字！表面上是为了研究不明飞行物，实际上很可能是在为先进武器系统打掩护。这不禁让人怀疑，所谓的UFO研究，是不是在为某些秘密军事项目提供资金支持？

更可笑的是，他们还拉来了前宇航员约翰·格伦站台。这就像是在说：“看，连宇航员都相信有外星人！”但仔细想想，这不过是在利用公众对太空探索的崇拜心理，为这个项目增加可信度。

最令人不安的是，这个项目居然还涉及所谓的“Skinwalker Ranch”研究。这地方可是以各种超自然现象和阴谋论著称。把纳税人的钱花在这种地方，难道不是在浪费公共资源吗？

说到底，这个所谓的UFO研究项目，很可能只是一场精心策划的政治秀。它利用公众对外星生命的好奇心，为某些见不得光的军事项目提供资金支持。而那些政客们，则借此机会为自己的选区争取利益，同时还能在公众面前塑造“开明探索者”的形象。

我们不禁要问：在这个信息爆炸的时代，我们是否太容易被这些看似“高大上”的项目所迷惑？我们是否应该更加警惕，那些打着“科学研究”旗号，实则可能隐藏着不可告人目的的项目？毕竟，在这个世界上，真相往往比我们想象的更加复杂，也更加令人不安。

分析结果：
让我们以休谟的质疑之锥来分析这段文字：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "proprietary to the U.S. government"的具体含义是什么？是否涉及国家安全？还是商业机密？
   - "green flags"在关系中的具体表现是什么？是否有客观标准？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 政府涉密信息的保密制度是如何形成的？其历史演变过程如何？
   - "green flags"这个概念是如何在心理学领域兴起的？其理论基础是什么？

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设信息保密是出于国家利益，这个假设是否合理？是否有其他可能性？
   - 假设识别"green flags"就能改善关系，这个假设是否过于简化？是否忽略了关系的复杂性？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从政府角度，保密可能是必要的；但从公众知情权角度，透明度同样重要。如何平衡？
   - "green flags"固然重要，但过度关注是否会导致忽视其他重要因素？如何全面看待关系质量？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 信息保密不应成为掩盖真相的借口，政府应建立更透明的信息披露机制。
   - 健康的关系不仅需要识别"green flags"，更需要双方持续投入和共同成长。

通过系统性怀疑，我们认识到信息透明和关系质量都是复杂议题，需要更深入和全面的思考。

[P124] No shit.
[P125] And let's not forget that he was in World War II.
[P126] Senator Inouye actually gave his arm for his country, all of our veterans.
[P127] Stevens was a pilot, and he had his own UAP experience.
[P128] And then, of course,
[P129] He was Alaska.
[P130] He was Alaska.
[P131] Okay.
[P132] Ted Stevens.
[P133] What was his experience?
[P134] Well, he reported, you know, classic Foo Fighter experience, these objects that would pursue him while he was a pilot, and they were performing in ways that he couldn't explain.
[P135] They were outperforming anything that he was aware of as a pilot.
[P136] instantaneous acceleration, very, very fast maneuvers, well beyond the structural limitations of what we had at the time technologically.
[P137] And so, and this, by the way, this is not isolated.
[P138] If you get a chance to talk to members of Congress privately, a lot of them will share with you their own UAP experiences.
[P139] They're like, hey, man, I was fishing with my son and all of a sudden this thing comes out of the water and saw it right there in front of us.
[P140] I think, you know, politically, they're a little shy to have that discussion publicly.
[P141] Now, maybe it'll come out, but
[P142] You'd be surprised how many people, members of Congress, have had their own experience.
[P143] Is there a lot of... I mean, the reason I brought up the three states, Nevada, obviously a lot of activity.
[P144] Alaska, a lot of activity.
[P145] Hawaii, is there a lot of activity down there?
[P146] Well, there is some.
[P147] I don't... It's hard to say there's a lot.
[P148] So there's an issue with Hawaii.
[P149] It's population density and surface area.
[P150] So...
[P151] Nevada, Alaska, lots of land mass.
[P152] When you have people all around, so you get pretty much a good persistent eye in the sky.
[P153] Maybe there's a farmer, maybe there's someone driving a truck, maybe there's a military person, military bases.

分析结果：
休谟举起质疑之锥，对这段对话进行真理冲击：

1. **澄清定义**
   - 需要明确"UAP"的具体定义和特征
   - 区分"UAP"与已知自然现象或人造物体的区别

2. **概念溯源**
   - 探究"Foo Fighter"这一术语的历史渊源
   - 考察二战期间飞行员报告的类似现象

3. **解构假设**
   - 质疑"UAP"性能超出人类技术水平的结论
   - 检验目击报告的可信度和证据链

4. **辩证分析**
   - 考虑目击报告可能存在的主观偏差
   - 探索其他可能的解释，如光学错觉、心理因素等
   - 分析地理位置与UAP目击频率的关联性

5. **刷新表述**
   - 虽然存在大量UAP目击报告，但缺乏确凿证据证明其超自然属性
   - 需要建立更科学、系统的UAP研究框架
   - 建议加强相关数据的收集和分析，以得出更可靠的结论

休谟放下质疑之锥，总结道：对未知现象保持开放态度固然重要，但更需要以严谨的科学精神进行探索和验证。

输入内容：
[P64] So everybody starts with an introduction here.
[P65] So I think we might wind up doing a little bit of a life story here.
[P66] I wasn't planning on doing that, but...
[P67] This sounds super interesting.
[P68] Lou Elizondo, Lou Elizondo, you're a former U.S.
[P69] Army counterintelligence special agent and former employee of the Office of the Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.
[P70] You led a previously covert program within the Department of Defense investigating unidentified aerial phenomenon, UAP.
[P71] Okay.
[P72] You came forward to the public about Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, AATIP, bringing to light what the government knew about these mysterious objects in our skies.
[P73] Since then, you've worked to educate both the public and policymakers about the potential implications of UAPs for national security, science, and human understanding.
[P74] You've been involved with organizations like To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science aimed at advancing research into these phenomena.
[P75] You're a fixture in the UAP transparency movement and have appeared in numerous interviews, documentaries, and media segments discussing UAPs where you've shared insight from your experience while critiquing the government's approach to transparency on this subject.
[P76] Welcome to the show.
[P77] Thank you.
[P78] One point of correction.
[P79] The UAP program at the Pentagon was not... I did run covert operations and activities, but that was for another effort while working for the U.S.
[P80] government.
[P81] The ATIP program, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which I helped lead in working with some of my colleagues, was a very sensitive program, but it wasn't covert.
[P82] I know people like to... And forgive me for saying that.
[P83] I don't know why it says that.
[P84] There's a legal definition of covert activities.
[P85] And then there is from a Department of Defense, which is Title 50.
[P86] And then from a Title 10 or DOD perspective, you have clandestine type operations and sensitive operations.
[P87] But AATIP was not covert.
[P88] It was sensitive and a lot of classified aspects to it, but it was not a Title 50 program.
[P89] Although I ran it under when I was wearing my Title 50 hat under the covert umbrella.
[P90] But in itself, it was not a covert program.
[P91] It was a highly sensitive program.
[P92] with a lot of classified aspects that I ran while I was running covert operations.
[P93] Okay.

分析结果：
休谟举起怀疑之锥，开始解构这段对话中的关键概念：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "Covert"与"sensitive"的区别需要明确。根据Title 50和Title 10，前者涉及秘密行动，后者则指高度机密但非秘密的行动。

2. **概念溯源**
   - AATIP（Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program）的历史背景需要进一步考察。它是如何成立的？其具体职责是什么？

3. **解构假设**
   - 对话中隐含了一个假设：公众对"covert"和"sensitive"的理解存在混淆。这种混淆是如何产生的？是媒体报道的误导，还是信息本身的不透明？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从政府角度，区分"covert"和"sensitive"有其必要性，但公众为何会混淆？这种混淆反映了什么样的信息传播问题？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 基于以上分析，可以得出：AATIP是一个高度敏感但非秘密的项目。公众对其性质的误解，反映了政府与公众之间在信息透明度上的鸿沟。这种鸿沟需要通过更清晰的信息披露来弥合。

休谟放下怀疑之锥，总结道：在讨论政府项目时，精确使用术语至关重要。同时，政府也应反思如何更好地与公众沟通，以避免不必要的误解和猜疑。

[P8] Some CIA guys also were there.
[P9] Didn't make it, unfortunately.
[P10] But he was for two years in Castro's prisons.
[P11] My father was a wonderful human being, but he's also a very tormented soul.
[P12] And now, you know, we can recognize, oh, he had PTSD, right?
[P13] Or as the old timers used to say, shell shock.
[P14] So he struggled with anger and volatility for a very long time during his life.
[P15] And as a young person, I had a really weird background.
[P16] My...
[P17] There was always this idea, this understanding that after the Brigade 2506, which was what my father was part of.
[P18] In fact, if you type in my name, Luis Elizondo and Bay of Pigs, you'll see my father's prisoner number.
[P19] There was always this understanding that there would be a reinvasion by the new generation, by us, by the kids and part of Alpha 66 and try to.
[P20] So I had a really weird upbringing as a child, always with smoke-filled rooms and dim lights and weird conversations.

分析结果：
让我们仔细审视这段叙述，解构其中的关键要素：

1. **身份认同的构建**
   - 叙述者通过家族历史（古巴裔、猪湾事件参与者）确立个人身份
   - 这种身份带有明显的政治和历史烙印

2. **创伤的代际传递**
   - 父亲作为革命者的经历（被俘、监禁）导致PTSD
   - 这种创伤影响了家庭氛围和子女成长环境

3. **历史事件的个人化**
   - 将宏观历史事件（猪湾事件）与个人家族史紧密联系
   - 通过具体细节（囚犯编号、USS Houston）增强可信度

4. **政治期望的延续**
   - "新一代将再次入侵"的观念反映了政治理想的代际传承
   - 这种期待塑造了独特的成长环境（烟雾缭绕的房间、秘密谈话）

5. **心理影响的认知**
   - 用现代心理学概念（PTSD）重新诠释历史创伤
   - 体现了对父辈经历的理解和反思

这段叙述揭示了个人身份如何被历史事件塑造，以及创伤如何跨越代际影响家庭。它提醒我们，宏观历史往往通过微观的个人经历得以延续和再现。同时，也展现了后人对历史事件的重新诠释和理解过程。

[P154] Hawaii is a much smaller land mass.
[P155] So you have
[P156] fewer people in a smaller area looking up towards the sky.
[P157] So we don't really know if Hawaii is necessarily a hotspot.
[P158] We do have a military presence there, as we know, and we do have a couple sensitive facilities there because of geographically where it's located.
[P159] And so it shouldn't be any surprise that we've had UAP activity there.
[P160] But whether or not it's as much or as consistent as some of these other areas, like we've seen with, like, now New Jersey, for example, with the drones, right, where they're being reported everywhere, you don't have that type of population
[P161] in Hawaii and you don't have the land mass.
[P162] So we really don't know.
[P163] We don't know if there's actually more activity occurring around the waters.
[P164] We don't know if there's actually an increase or a decrease simply because we don't have enough persistent, I guess I hate to use the word persistent surveillance there, but we just don't.
[P165] Remember, it's a few little islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
[P166] And so unless you're right there at the time something's happening, you're not going to know.
[P167] Mm-hmm.
[P168] You'd mentioned Skimwalker Ranch.
[P169] I'm just going, I don't want to lose anything.
[P170] No, no, no.
[P171] Have you done any work out there with Brandon?
[P172] Well, so before Brandon, there was a gentleman named Bob Bigelow, and he owned Bigelow Aerospace.
[P173] By the way, this is a gentleman who made his fortune in the hotel industry and then decided to jump to aerospace and actually succeeded, right?
[P174] So this is a guy who put together these inhabitable inflatable machines
[P175] type modules that could hook on to the ISS space station, which, by the way, they're there right now.
[P176] He actually has them connected.
[P177] And he had these projects, Genesis 1, Genesis 2 projects, to create these inflatable habitats for NASA as kind of NASA's future space program.
[P178] And he was very successful.
[P179] So he actually helped fund
[P180] through his own money, a lot of what OSAP originally did to include Skinwalker Ranch.
[P181] He owned the ranch before Brandon Fugel owned it.
[P182] And there was a very robust research effort ongoing.
[P183] People don't know that.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**"观测密度"决定现象发现率**

夏威夷的UAP（不明空中现象）活动是否真的比其他地区少，关键在于**观测密度**——即单位面积内的观察者数量。夏威夷人口少、面积小，意味着观测密度低，发现UAP的概率自然降低。而像新泽西这样人口密集、面积较大的地区，观测密度高，UAP报告自然更多。

### 核心洞察：
- **观测密度**是决定UAP报告数量的关键因素，而非实际活动频率。
- 夏威夷的特殊地理位置和军事设施可能吸引UAP活动，但缺乏足够的观测数据支持。

### 解决步骤：
1. **提高观测密度**：在夏威夷部署更多观测设备或鼓励公众参与UAP观察。
2. **数据分析**：对比不同地区的观测密度与UAP报告数量，验证假设。
3. **持续监测**：建立长期监测系统，收集更全面的数据。

### 类比：
就像在森林中寻找稀有动物，观察者越多，发现稀有动物的概率越高。夏威夷就像一片人迹罕至的森林，即使稀有动物（UAP）存在，也很难被发现。

### 结论：
夏威夷的UAP活动可能并不比其他地区少，只是缺乏足够的观察者。提高观测密度是解开这一谜题的关键。

[P154] Hawaii is a much smaller land mass.
[P155] So you have
[P156] fewer people in a smaller area looking up towards the sky.
[P157] So we don't really know if Hawaii is necessarily a hotspot.
[P158] We do have a military presence there, as we know, and we do have a couple sensitive facilities there because of geographically where it's located.
[P159] And so it shouldn't be any surprise that we've had UAP activity there.
[P160] But whether or not it's as much or as consistent as some of these other areas, like we've seen with, like, now New Jersey, for example, with the drones, right, where they're being reported everywhere, you don't have that type of population
[P161] in Hawaii and you don't have the land mass.
[P162] So we really don't know.
[P163] We don't know if there's actually more activity occurring around the waters.
[P164] We don't know if there's actually an increase or a decrease simply because we don't have enough persistent, I guess I hate to use the word persistent surveillance there, but we just don't.
[P165] Remember, it's a few little islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
[P166] And so unless you're right there at the time something's happening, you're not going to know.
[P167] Mm-hmm.
[P168] You'd mentioned Skimwalker Ranch.
[P169] I'm just going, I don't want to lose anything.
[P170] No, no, no.
[P171] Have you done any work out there with Brandon?
[P172] Well, so before Brandon, there was a gentleman named Bob Bigelow, and he owned Bigelow Aerospace.
[P173] By the way, this is a gentleman who made his fortune in the hotel industry and then decided to jump to aerospace and actually succeeded, right?
[P174] So this is a guy who put together these inhabitable inflatable machines
[P175] type modules that could hook on to the ISS space station, which, by the way, they're there right now.
[P176] He actually has them connected.
[P177] And he had these projects, Genesis 1, Genesis 2 projects, to create these inflatable habitats for NASA as kind of NASA's future space program.
[P178] And he was very successful.
[P179] So he actually helped fund
[P180] through his own money, a lot of what OSAP originally did to include Skinwalker Ranch.
[P181] He owned the ranch before Brandon Fugel owned it.
[P182] And there was a very robust research effort ongoing.
[P183] People don't know that.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **Hawaii ≈ 小面积 + 少人口**  
2. **UAP活动 ↔ 军事存在 + 敏感设施**  
3. **监测不足 ≈ 持久性监控缺失**  
4. **Skimwalker Ranch ≈ Bigelow资助 + 研究项目**

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **Hawaii的特性**  
   - 面积小 + 人口少 → 观测机会有限  
   - 地理位置特殊 → 军事存在 + 敏感设施  
   - 监测不足 → UAP活动的不确定性  

2. **Skimwalker Ranch的背景**  
   - Bigelow资助 → 研究项目启动  
   - 研究项目 → 未来太空计划探索  
   - 研究努力 → 公众认知不足  

### 知识精髓提炼
Hawaii的UAP活动难以确定，主要受限于面积小、人口少及监测不足；而Skimwalker Ranch的研究项目由Bigelow资助，推动了未来太空计划的探索，但公众对其了解有限。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段对话涉及多个概念，我们可以逐一分析其本质。

首先，关于夏威夷作为UAP（不明空中现象）热点的问题，其本质在于观测条件与现象发生频率之间的关系。夏威夷的地理特征（小面积、少人口）限制了观测的可能性，这与新泽西等人口密集地区形成对比。这里的主要矛盾是现象存在与观测能力之间的矛盾。

其次，关于Skinwalker Ranch的研究，其本质是私人资金推动的非常规现象研究。Bob Bigelow的角色体现了私人企业家在航空航天领域的跨界尝试，其成功在于将商业思维应用于科研领域。这里的主要矛盾是传统科研模式与私人创新之间的矛盾。

从存在主义的角度看，这些研究之所以存在，源于人类对未知现象的好奇心与探索欲。无论是对UAP的观测，还是对非常规现象的研究，都体现了人类试图突破认知边界的本质需求。

通过现象学还原，我们可以发现，这些讨论的核心在于人类如何认知和理解超出常规经验的现象。无论是通过军事设施观测，还是通过私人资助研究，都是人类试图建立对未知现象认知框架的尝试。

因此，这些讨论的本质可以定义为：人类在有限认知条件下，通过各种途径探索和理解超出常规经验的现象的过程。其属为认知活动，种差为针对非常规现象的探索性研究。

分析结果：
就像在太平洋上撒了几粒芝麻，夏威夷的岛屿群虽然引人注目，但面积和人口都有限。想象一下，在一个小岛上仰望星空，与在广袤的大陆上相比，观测到的UAP活动自然会有差异。这就像在一个小池塘里钓鱼，与在大湖中相比，鱼的种类和数量都会有所不同。至于Skinwalker Ranch，它就像一个神秘的研究实验室，由一位从酒店业跨界到航天业的奇才Bob Bigelow资助，他就像一位现代版的达芬奇，将可居住的充气模块送上了国际空间站，为NASA的未来太空计划铺路。Skinwalker Ranch在他手中，就像一个充满未知的科研宝库，等待着被探索和揭示。

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这段对话背后的深层含义。

首先，关于夏威夷的UAP（不明空中现象）活动，表面上是在讨论地理和人口因素对观测的影响，但更深层次反映的是人类对未知的恐惧和好奇心。我们总是试图用已知的框架去解释未知现象，比如用人口密度和陆地面积来衡量UAP活动的频率。这暴露了人类认知的局限性 - 我们习惯于用可量化的数据来理解世界，但宇宙的奥秘往往超出我们的理解范围。

其次，提到Skimwalker Ranch和Bob Bigelow的故事，这不仅仅是关于一个富豪的跨界成功，更是反映了人类探索未知的永恒冲动。Bigelow从酒店业转向航空航天，这种跨界本身就值得深思。它说明了人类对未知领域的探索欲望是如此强烈，以至于可以跨越看似不相关的领域。他的充气太空舱项目更是体现了人类对太空殖民的渴望，这种渴望背后是对地球资源有限性的焦虑。

更深一层看，这些讨论都指向了人类面对未知时的矛盾心理：既渴望探索，又害怕真相。我们投入大量资源研究UAP和外星生命，但同时又担心这些发现会颠覆我们现有的世界观。这种矛盾心理在历史上不断重演，从哥伦布发现新大陆到现代太空探索，人类总是在探索与恐惧之间徘徊。

最后，这些讨论也暴露了科学研究的局限性。我们依赖"持续监视"来收集数据，但这种方法本身就存在盲点。真正的突破往往来自于跳出常规思维框架，而这正是像Bigelow这样的跨界者所擅长的。

总的来说，这段对话不仅仅是在讨论UAP或太空探索，更是在探讨人类认知的边界、探索未知的冲动，以及我们在面对宇宙奥秘时的矛盾心理。它提醒我们，真正的发现往往需要跳出固有思维，拥抱不确定性。

分析结果：
让我们运用休谟的怀疑之锥，对这段对话进行深入分析：

1. **澄清定义**
   - 什么是"UAP热点"？需要明确其定义和判断标准
   - "持续监视"具体指什么？技术手段、时间跨度、覆盖范围等都需要界定

2. **概念溯源**
   - 夏威夷作为UAP热点的说法从何而来？是否有历史数据支持？
   - 新泽西的无人机事件与夏威夷的UAP活动是否具有可比性？

3. **解构假设**
   - 人口密度和陆地面积是否真的是影响UAP观测的关键因素？
   - 军事设施的存在是否必然导致更多的UAP活动？
   - 缺乏持续监视是否等同于无法判断UAP活动频率？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从地理角度看，夏威夷位于太平洋中心，是否可能成为UAP活动的天然观测点？
   - 考虑到海洋面积，水下活动是否比空中活动更值得关注？
   - Bob Bigelow的背景是否影响了他对Skinwalker Ranch的研究方向？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 夏威夷的UAP活动频率可能需要新的观测方法来评估，而非简单对比其他地区
   - Skinwalker Ranch的研究历史表明，私人资助在UAP研究中扮演了重要角色
   - 对UAP现象的研究需要跨学科、多角度的综合方法，而不仅限于单一视角

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们可以超越表面现象，深入探讨UAP研究的复杂性和多维度特征。

主题：投资平台功能介绍 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P1] You're here for tips on leveling up your career, but here's a bonus tip on leveling up your investments.
[P2] Check out Public.
[P3] Public is an investing platform where you can invest in stocks, options, bonds, ETFs, and crypto all in one place.
[P4] Public is a modern brokerage and has brought innovation to aspects of investing that were dinosaur-y.
[P5] I'll give you an example.
[P6] Public is one of the only brokerages to offer self-directed investing in bonds, even treasuries, which have historically been sold primarily through a government website.
[P7] But with Public, you can invest in treasuries with just a few clicks right from your phone.
[P8] And public allows you to make fractional investments in bonds.
[P9] So before fractional bonds on public, you had to buy government bonds starting with a $1,000 investment at a minimum.
[P10] And if you wanted to invest in any more than that, you could only invest in $100 increments.
[P11] Now you can buy bonds for as little as $100 and for any dollar amount on public.
[P12] That's just one example of how public is making it easier to invest, but there are a ton more and you can explore them for yourself at public.com slash help wanted.
[P13] To get started with your portfolio today, go to public.com slash help wanted.
[P14] This is a paid endorsement for public investing.
[P15] Full disclosure and conditions can be found in the podcast description.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**投资门槛的民主化**

**1. 尺度转换**  
从宏观角度看，投资市场一直被视为高门槛、专业化的领域，只有少数人能够参与。Public通过降低投资门槛，让更多人能够参与其中，实现了投资市场的民主化。

**2. 跨界思维**  
将投资比作“点外卖”：以前投资像去高档餐厅，需要大额消费和复杂流程；现在Public让投资变得像点外卖，简单、便捷、小额即可参与。

**3. 极限思考**  
极端情况下，如果所有人都能轻松投资，市场会变得更加活跃和多元化。Public通过提供小额、灵活的债券投资，让普通人也能够参与政府债券市场，打破了传统的高门槛限制。

**4. 系统思维**  
Public不仅仅是一个投资平台，它改变了整个投资生态。通过简化流程、降低门槛，它让更多人能够参与到金融系统中，从而推动整个市场的创新和发展。

**5. 逆向思考**  
传统投资平台强调“专业”和“高门槛”，而Public反其道而行之，强调“简单”和“普惠”，这种逆向思维让它脱颖而出。

**6. 简化思维**  
Public的核心价值在于“简化”：简化投资流程、简化投资金额、简化投资工具。它让复杂的投资变得像日常购物一样简单。

**7. 历史视角**  
回顾历史，投资市场一直是少数人的游戏。Public通过技术创新，打破了这种历史惯性，让投资变得大众化。

**8. 跳出框架**  
Public没有局限于传统投资平台的模式，而是重新定义了“投资”的概念：投资不再需要大额资金和复杂流程，而是可以像日常消费一样轻松完成。

### 总结
Public通过降低投资门槛、简化投资流程，让投资变得像点外卖一样简单。它不仅改变了投资的方式，更改变了投资的意义：投资不再是少数人的特权，而是每个人都可以参与的经济活动。这种“投资民主化”的视角，正是Public的核心价值所在。

### 现状分析
在这个快节奏的社会中，工作已经成为人们生活的核心。每个人都渴望找到一份既能满足经济需求又能带来个人成就感的工作。然而，现实往往不尽如人意，许多人陷入工作的泥潭，无法自拔。电视节目《Help Wanted》正是抓住了这一社会痛点，试图通过专家的建议和实用的技巧，帮助观众改善工作状况，提升职业满意度。

### 个体剖析
Jason Pfeiffer和Nicole Lappin作为节目的主持人，分别代表了企业家精神和财务管理智慧。他们的存在不仅仅是为了提供建议，更是为了激发观众的自我反思。观众在观看节目时，往往会不自觉地与主持人进行对比，思考自己在职场中的位置和未来的发展方向。这种自我剖析的过程，实际上是一种内在的驱动力，促使观众主动寻求改变。

### 群体透视
从更广泛的社会角度来看，《Help Wanted》反映了现代职场中的普遍问题：工作与生活的平衡、职业发展的瓶颈、以及个人价值的实现。这些问题不仅仅是个人层面的挑战，更是整个社会需要共同面对的难题。通过电视节目这种大众传播媒介，这些问题被放大，引起了更广泛的关注和讨论。然而，节目所提供的解决方案是否真的能够解决深层次的社会矛盾，仍然值得怀疑。

### 思考整合
《Help Wanted》通过提供实用的工作建议，试图帮助观众改善职业状况。然而，真正的改变不仅仅依赖于外部的建议，更需要内在的驱动力和深刻的社会变革。节目虽然能够引起观众的共鸣，但最终能否实现真正的职业自由和个人价值，仍然取决于每个人的自我觉醒和社会的整体进步。在这个意义上，《Help Wanted》更像是一面镜子，映照出我们每个人在职场中的困境和希望。

分析结果：
### 跳出框架：重新定义“费用”的概念

通常，我们把“费用”视为不可避免的支出，但换个角度，费用其实是“选择”的结果。每一次支付费用，都是在为某种便利、服务或体验买单。比如，旅行中的各种费用，本质上是为了换取时间、舒适或体验。与其抱怨费用，不如重新评估这些选择的价值。

### 简化思维：聚焦核心支出

与其被各种费用困扰，不如简化思维，聚焦于核心支出。比如，旅行时，哪些费用是真正必要的？哪些是可以避免的？通过精简支出，可以更好地控制预算，避免被“费用”牵着鼻子走。

### 系统思维：费用与价值的平衡

费用是系统的一部分，它们与提供的价值息息相关。比如，Chime账户的“无维护费”和“免透支费”功能，实际上是在降低用户的财务负担，提升财务自由度。通过选择这样的服务，可以在系统中实现费用与价值的更好平衡。

### 逆向思考：从结果反推费用

逆向思考一下，如果不支付这些费用，会带来什么后果？比如，不支付旅行费用，可能意味着无法到达目的地，或者选择更不便利的方式。通过这种思考，可以更理性地看待费用，而不是单纯地感到困扰。

### 极限思考：极端情况下的费用

想象一下，如果所有费用都被取消，生活会变成什么样？可能服务质量和便利性会大幅下降。费用实际上是维持服务和便利的必要条件。通过这种极限思考，可以更理解费用的存在意义。

### 跨界思维：费用与投资的类比

把费用看作一种“投资”，而不是“支出”。比如，支付旅行费用，实际上是在投资于体验和记忆；支付金融服务费用，是在投资于财务自由和未来。通过这种类比，可以更积极地看待费用。

### 历史视角：费用的演变

回顾历史，费用的形式和意义一直在变化。比如，过去可能需要支付高额的银行手续费，而现在有像Chime这样的服务提供免维护费和免透支费。通过历史视角，可以看到费用的优化和进步。

### 尺度转换：从微观到宏观

从微观角度看，每一笔费用可能让人感到压力，但从宏观角度看，这些费用是维持社会运转和个人生活的一部分。通过尺度转换，可以更全面地理解费用的意义。

---

总结来说，费用并不是单纯的“负担”，而是“选择”和“价值”的体现。通过重新定义、简化、系统化、逆向、极限、跨界、历史和尺度转换的思考，可以找到更理性、更积极的视角来看待费用问题。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。投资平台的本质是什么？它存在的理由是什么？

从演化角度看，投资平台源于人类对财富增值的需求。最早的交易是物物交换，后来发展出货币作为中介，再后来出现了股票、债券等金融工具。投资平台就是这些金融工具的数字化载体。

使用矛盾分析法，投资平台的主要矛盾在于：既要降低投资门槛让更多人参与，又要保证投资的规范性和安全性。Public通过技术创新解决了这个矛盾，比如允许小额投资债券。

从存在主义视角看，投资平台存在的理由是帮助人们实现财富增值的愿望。它通过技术手段降低了投资门槛，让更多人能够参与其中。

通过现象学还原，褪去表象，投资平台的本质是一个连接投资者与金融市场的数字化中介。它通过技术创新，让投资变得更便捷、更普惠。

属和种差定义：投资平台（属）是一种通过数字化手段连接投资者与金融市场的工具（种差），其核心价值在于降低投资门槛，提高投资效率。

[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.
[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.
[P641] Well, we will continue the conversation then.
[P642] Katie Storino, thank you so much for joining us on Help Wanted.
[P643] Thank you guys.

分析结果：
从这段对话中，我们可以找到一个独特的观察角度：**社交计划失败的核心原因往往不是“不想见”，而是“社交能量管理”与“社交焦虑”的冲突**。以下是简化后的分析：

1. **社交能量管理**  
   - 许多人（如Katie）在社交前会过度消耗心理能量，担心自己是否能在特定时间点保持“社交状态”。  
   - 这种能量管理问题导致他们倾向于回避提前计划，尤其是与新朋友或不太熟悉的人见面。

2. **社交焦虑**  
   - 社交焦虑不仅表现为“害怕见人”，还表现为对社交互动的过度思考（如“我说错话怎么办？”、“他们喜欢我吗？”）。  
   - 这种焦虑会让计划变得复杂，甚至让人在最后一刻取消或回避。

3. **解决方案的独特视角**  
   - **降低社交压力**：将计划简化为“低门槛”活动（如短时间、近距离的见面），减少心理负担。  
   - **明确社交边界**：承认自己的社交能量有限，并坦诚告知对方，避免误解。  
   - **打破“四人组”模式**：避免默认的“夫妻分组”对话，尝试让所有人参与同一话题，减少尴尬。  

**总结**：社交计划失败的核心并非“不想见”，而是人们在社交能量与焦虑之间的挣扎。通过调整计划方式、降低心理负担，可以更轻松地维持社交关系。

分析结果：
### 演化分析
从历史上看，费用最初是作为服务或资源的交换而出现的。随着社会复杂化，费用逐渐演变为一种经济调控手段，用于管理资源分配和维持系统运行。

### 矛盾分析
费用的主要矛盾在于其双重性：一方面，它们是维持服务和基础设施的必要条件；另一方面，它们增加了个人和家庭的经济负担，可能阻碍财务自由。

### 存在理由
费用存在的根本理由是确保服务的可持续性和质量。它们为提供者提供了必要的资金支持，以维持和改进服务。

### 本质还原
褪去表象，费用的本质是一种经济交换机制，用于平衡资源提供者和使用者之间的利益。

### 属和种差
费用是一种经济交换机制，其种差在于它们是为了获取特定服务或资源而必须支付的金额。

[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.
[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.
[P641] Well, we will continue the conversation then.
[P642] Katie Storino, thank you so much for joining us on Help Wanted.
[P643] Thank you guys.

[P4] Public is a modern brokerage and has brought innovation to aspects of investing that were dinosaur-y.
[P5] I'll give you an example.
[P6] Public is one of the only brokerages to offer self-directed investing in bonds, even treasuries, which have historically been sold primarily through a government website.
[P7] But with Public, you can invest in treasuries with just a few clicks right from your phone.
[P8] And public allows you to make fractional investments in bonds.
[P9] So before fractional bonds on public, you had to buy government bonds starting with a $1,000 investment at a minimum.
[P10] And if you wanted to invest in any more than that, you could only invest in $100 increments.
[P11] Now you can buy bonds for as little as $100 and for any dollar amount on public.
[P12] That's just one example of how public is making it easier to invest, but there are a ton more and you can explore them for yourself at public.com slash help wanted.
[P13] To get started with your portfolio today, go to public.com slash help wanted.
[P14] This is a paid endorsement for public investing.

分析结果：
在这个信息爆炸的时代，我们被各种“升级”和“创新”的承诺包围，仿佛每一个新平台、新工具都能成为我们通往成功的金钥匙。Public的广告声称要革新投资方式，让每个人都能轻松投资于股票、债券、加密货币等。但让我们停下来，深入思考一下，这背后究竟隐藏着什么？

首先，这种“简化”投资过程的承诺，是否真的让普通人受益？还是说，它只是让更多的人在缺乏足够知识和准备的情况下，盲目地投入金融市场？我们生活在一个即时满足的时代，点击几下手机屏幕就能投资，这种便利性是否掩盖了投资本身的风险和复杂性？当投资变得像点外卖一样简单，我们是否也更容易忽视那些潜在的、可能导致财务灾难的细节？

其次，Public强调的“创新”是否真的改变了游戏规则，还是只是换了个包装？比如，提供小额投资债券的功能，听起来像是让更多人参与，但这是否只是将风险分散给了更多的小投资者？历史上，金融创新往往伴随着新的风险，而最终承担这些风险的，往往是那些最不具备抵御能力的普通投资者。

再者，这种“现代”投资平台的兴起，是否加剧了社会的财富不平等？当投资门槛降低，理论上更多人能参与，但实际上，信息和资源的分配仍然极不均衡。那些拥有更多资源和知识的人，依然能在市场中占据优势，而普通人可能只是在这场游戏中充当了“韭菜”的角色。

最后，我们不得不质疑，这种“付费代言”的广告，是否真正透明？当广告主支付费用来推广他们的产品时，我们看到的“推荐”是否还能保持客观？在商业利益驱动下，所谓的“创新”和“便利”是否被过度美化，而潜在的风险和问题被有意无意地忽略？

总之，面对这些看似美好的承诺，我们需要保持清醒的头脑。投资从来不是一件简单的事，真正的“升级”不是依赖于某个平台或工具，而是通过不断学习和积累经验，提升自己的财务素养和风险意识。否则，我们可能只是在追逐一个虚幻的梦想，而忽视了脚下的陷阱。

[P16] Doesn't it feel like every time you step out the door, you have to pay a fee?

分析结果：
走出家门，每一步都要付费，这听起来像是现代生活的荒谬写照。我们生活在一个被各种隐形费用包围的时代，从交通到通讯，从娱乐到生活必需品，每一项服务似乎都在悄悄地侵蚀我们的钱包。这种无处不在的收费机制，不仅让个人的财务管理变得复杂，也在无形中加剧了社会的不平等。

首先，从个体角度来看，频繁的收费让人感到无力。每次出行、每次使用服务，都需要额外支付费用，这不仅打乱了原本的预算计划，也让人们感到被剥削。更糟糕的是，这些费用往往是不可预见的，就像生活中的“曲线球”，让人措手不及。这种不确定性，使得人们在追求财务稳定的道路上，常常感到步履维艰。

其次，从社会层面来看，这种收费机制反映了资本主义经济的深层矛盾。企业通过不断增设费用来增加利润，而消费者则被迫承担这些额外的成本。这种模式不仅加剧了贫富差距，也让普通人的生活压力倍增。我们生活在一个被资本主导的世界，每一个决策、每一次消费，都在无形中被资本的力量所操控。

最后，所谓的“无费用”银行账户，虽然看似是一种解决方案，但实际上只是另一种营销策略。它通过吸引人们关注“无费用”这一表面现象，掩盖了其背后的复杂条款和限制条件。这种营销手段，本质上是对消费者的一种误导，让人们误以为找到了解决财务问题的捷径，而实际上，问题依然存在。

总的来说，现代生活中的各种费用，不仅是个人的财务负担，更是社会不平等和资本主义矛盾的体现。我们需要更深入地思考这些问题，寻找真正的解决方案，而不是被表面的“无费用”承诺所迷惑。

主题：社交计划困难讨论 - essence

输入内容：
[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.
[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.
[P641] Well, we will continue the conversation then.
[P642] Katie Storino, thank you so much for joining us on Help Wanted.
[P643] Thank you guys.

   社交计划的存在是为了满足人类对归属感和连接感的基本需求。然而，其执行困难反映了现代社会中个体在平衡个人需求与社交义务时的挣扎。

4. **本质还原**  
   社交计划的本质是一种承诺，其背后涉及个体的心理状态、时间管理能力、社交意愿等多重因素。计划的失败并非单纯因为缺乏意愿，而是这些复杂因素共同作用的结果。

5. **属和种差**  
   **属**：社交行为  
   **种差**：涉及计划制定与执行的复杂心理和社会因素，包括社交焦虑、精力分配、时间管理等。

[P1] You're here for tips on leveling up your career, but here's a bonus tip on leveling up your investments.
[P2] Check out Public.
[P3] Public is an investing platform where you can invest in stocks, options, bonds, ETFs, and crypto all in one place.
[P4] Public is a modern brokerage and has brought innovation to aspects of investing that were dinosaur-y.
[P5] I'll give you an example.
[P6] Public is one of the only brokerages to offer self-directed investing in bonds, even treasuries, which have historically been sold primarily through a government website.
[P7] But with Public, you can invest in treasuries with just a few clicks right from your phone.
[P8] And public allows you to make fractional investments in bonds.
[P9] So before fractional bonds on public, you had to buy government bonds starting with a $1,000 investment at a minimum.
[P10] And if you wanted to invest in any more than that, you could only invest in $100 increments.
[P11] Now you can buy bonds for as little as $100 and for any dollar amount on public.
[P12] That's just one example of how public is making it easier to invest, but there are a ton more and you can explore them for yourself at public.com slash help wanted.
[P13] To get started with your portfolio today, go to public.com slash help wanted.
[P14] This is a paid endorsement for public investing.
[P15] Full disclosure and conditions can be found in the podcast description.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来审视这段投资建议：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "现代经纪平台"具体指什么？与传统平台相比，Public的创新之处在哪里？
   - "简化投资"的含义是什么？这种简化是否意味着降低了投资门槛，还是简化了投资决策过程？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 债券投资的历史演变是怎样的？为什么传统上主要通过政府网站进行？
   - 分拆债券投资的概念从何而来？这种模式在其他平台是否也存在？

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设Public的创新确实带来了便利，但这种便利是否等同于更好的投资回报？
   - 假设手机操作简化了投资流程，但这是否可能导致投资者做出更草率的决策？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从投资者角度：低门槛是否意味着更多人可以参与投资，还是可能增加非理性投资行为？
   - 从平台角度：这些创新是真正为投资者服务，还是为了吸引更多用户以获取佣金？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 投资平台的创新确实可能带来便利，但投资者仍需谨慎评估自身风险承受能力和投资目标。
   - 在选择投资平台时，除了操作便利性，还应考虑平台的安全性、透明度以及费用结构等因素。
   - 投资决策应该基于全面的研究和分析，而非仅仅因为操作便利就进行投资。

最终建议：在尝试任何新的投资平台或产品前，务必进行充分的研究，理解相关风险，并根据自身财务状况做出理性决策。

主题：社交计划困难讨论 - analogy

输入内容：
[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.
[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.
[P641] Well, we will continue the conversation then.
[P642] Katie Storino, thank you so much for joining us on Help Wanted.
[P643] Thank you guys.

就像在玩一场复杂的社交棋局，每个人都拿着自己的棋子，却不确定下一步该怎么走。有人犹豫不决，生怕走错一步；有人小心翼翼，生怕冒犯对方；还有人干脆原地打转，迟迟不肯迈出那一步。这盘棋的规则模糊不清，每个人都在用自己的方式解读，结果就是计划总是悬而未决，像一场永远无法结束的棋局。

[P16] Doesn't it feel like every time you step out the door, you have to pay a fee?
[P17] I mean, it is nuts.
[P18] I've been traveling a lot for the holidays and the amount of fees I pay just to get from point A to point B, it is mind boggling.
[P19] And it makes it really hard to stick with my spending plan.
[P20] When we're trying to make progress, life's curve balls often feel like taking one step forward and two steps back.
[P21] A chime checking account makes financial progress easier with features like no maintenance fees, fee-free overdraft up to $200,
[P22] or getting paid up to two days early with direct deposit.

[P24] And once you go to chime.com slash help wanted, you'll learn more about the fee-free overdraft up to $200.
[P25] And let me tell you, that is such a game changer.
[P26] Make progress towards a better financial future with Chime.
[P27] Open your account in two minutes at chime.com slash helpwanted.
[P28] That's chime.com slash helpwanted.
[P29] Chime.
[P30] Feels like progress.

[P33] Members FDIC.
[P34] SpotMe eligibility requirements and overdraft limits apply.
[P35] Boosts are available to eligible Chime members enrolled in SpotMe and are subject to monthly limits.
[P36] Timing depends on submission of payment file.
[P37] Fees apply at out-of-network ATMs.

分析结果：
让我们仔细审视这段对话中的几个关键点：

1. **费用问题的本质**  
   对话者提到频繁支付各种费用，这反映了现代生活中一个普遍现象：隐性成本的增加。我们需要质疑：这些费用是否都是必要的？是否存在更优化的选择？

2. **财务规划的挑战**  
   不可预见的支出确实会影响预算执行。但值得思考的是：我们是否过于依赖固定的支出计划，而忽视了建立应急缓冲的重要性？

3. **解决方案的提出**  
   对话中推广的Chime账户声称可以解决这些问题。我们需要审慎评估：这些"无费用"承诺是否真的能带来长期的经济效益？是否存在未被提及的限制条件？

4. **营销话术的分析**  
   对话中反复强调"进步"和"改变"，这是典型的营销策略。我们应该思考：这种表述是否过于理想化？它是否真正解决了根本的财务问题？

5. **更深层的思考**  
   这个问题实际上反映了现代社会中个人财务管理与商业利益之间的张力。我们需要探讨：在追求便利的同时，我们是否正在失去对个人财务的掌控力？

通过这种系统性质疑，我们可以得出一个更全面的认知：解决财务问题不仅需要选择合适的产品，更需要建立理性的消费观念和灵活的财务规划能力。任何"无费用"承诺都应该在充分了解其条款和限制的基础上进行选择。

主题：社交计划困难讨论 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.
[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.
[P641] Well, we will continue the conversation then.
[P642] Katie Storino, thank you so much for joining us on Help Wanted.
[P643] Thank you guys.

分析结果：
### 现状分析
现代社会中，人与人之间的社交互动变得越来越复杂。我们生活在一个信息爆炸、时间碎片化的时代，每个人都面临着工作、家庭、社交等多重压力。尤其是在城市生活中，社交计划往往因为各种不可预测的因素而被搁置或取消。这种现象在中年人群中尤为明显，他们不仅要应对职业上的挑战，还要承担家庭责任，社交活动因此变得不那么优先。

### 个体剖析
从个体的角度来看，社交焦虑是导致人们难以制定和履行社交计划的主要原因之一。许多人，尤其是那些不善于社交的人，面对新的社交场合时会感到不安和压力。他们担心自己会说错话、表现得不够好，或者对方并不真正想与自己交往。这种焦虑使得他们在面对社交邀请时犹豫不决，甚至选择逃避。

此外，个体的社交能力也影响了他们制定和履行计划的能力。有些人天生就不善于组织和管理时间，他们可能会因为忙碌或忘记而错过回复。还有一些人则是因为对社交活动的兴趣不高，或者对特定的人或场合感到不适，从而选择回避。

### 群体透视
从群体的角度来看，现代社会的社交模式也在发生变化。随着科技的发展，人们可以通过社交媒体保持联系，但这种联系往往是表面的、浅层次的。面对面的社交活动变得越来越少，人们更倾向于通过文字、语音或视频进行交流。这种变化使得人们在面对真实的社交场合时感到不适应，甚至产生恐惧。

此外，社会竞争和压力也影响了人们的社交行为。在职场中，人们可能会因为工作繁忙而无法抽出时间进行社交活动。在家庭中，照顾孩子和处理家务也会占用大量的时间和精力。这些因素都使得人们在面对社交邀请时感到力不从心，选择回避或推迟。

### 思考整合
综合现状、个体和群体的视角，我们可以得出一个核心洞察：现代社会的社交困境不仅仅是个人能力或意愿的问题，更是社会环境和文化变迁的结果。在快节奏、高压力的生活中，人们越来越难以找到时间和精力进行深入的社交互动。社交焦虑、时间管理不善、兴趣缺失等因素共同作用，使得社交计划变得难以制定和履行。

要解决这个问题，我们需要从多个层面入手。首先，个体需要正视自己的社交焦虑，学会管理和减轻这种压力。其次，社会需要创造更多的机会和空间，让人们能够轻松、自在地进行社交活动。最后，文化层面也需要重新审视和调整，鼓励人们重视面对面的交流，减少对虚拟社交的依赖。

### 最终思考
社交是人类生活的重要组成部分，但在现代社会中，它却变得越来越复杂和困难。我们每个人都在努力寻找平衡，既要应对生活的压力，又要维持社交关系。在这个过程中，理解和包容他人的难处，同时也正视自己的问题，或许是我们能够找到出路的关键。社交困境不是一个人的问题，而是整个社会需要共同面对的挑战。只有通过共同努力，我们才能在这个快节奏的世界中找到真正的连接和归属感。

主题：社交计划困难讨论 - doubt

输入内容：
[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.
[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.
[P641] Well, we will continue the conversation then.
[P642] Katie Storino, thank you so much for joining us on Help Wanted.
[P643] Thank you guys.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来剖析这段对话中的几个关键问题:

1. 关于"难以制定计划"的定义:
- 什么是"难以制定计划"?是难以回复邀约,还是难以执行计划?
- 不同人对"难以制定计划"的理解是否一致?需要明确具体表现。

2. 关于社交焦虑的影响:
- 社交焦虑如何影响人们制定和执行计划?具体机制是什么? 
- 社交焦虑的程度与"难以制定计划"之间是否存在相关性?

3. 关于"社交能力指数"的假设:
- 如何定义和测量"社交能力指数"?其构成要素是什么?
- "社交能力指数"随生活阶段变化的假设是否成立?需要更多证据支持。

4. 关于计划制定困难的普遍性:
- "难以制定计划"在人群中的普遍程度如何?是否有相关研究数据?
- 不同年龄段、性别、职业等人群的"难以制定计划"表现是否存在差异?

5. 关于couple间社交动态:
- 夫妻双方在社交计划制定中的角色和影响如何?
- 夫妻双方社交偏好的差异如何影响与其他couple的社交计划?

通过系统性怀疑和深入分析,我们可以得出一些新的洞见:
1. "难以制定计划"可能源于多重因素,包括社交焦虑、时间管理能力、优先级排序等,需要具体分析。
2. 社交计划制定和执行能力可能确实存在个体差异,并随生活阶段变化,但需要更科学的测量和验证。
3. couple间社交动态复杂,双方偏好和互动模式可能显著影响与其他couple的社交计划制定和执行。
4. 提高社交计划制定和执行能力,可能需要从认知、情感、行为等多层面进行干预和训练。

这些新认识有助于我们更全面、深入地理解"难以制定计划"这一现象,并为改善社交计划制定和执行提供思路。

分析结果：
### 从"社交能力指数"到"社交能量管理"

你提出的"社交能力指数"概念很有意思，但让我们换个角度思考——与其把社交能力看作一个固定的指数，不如把它视为一种"社交能量"的管理问题。

想象每个人都有一个"社交能量账户"。在忙碌的创造期（如建立家庭或专注事业），我们的社交能量会自然消耗得更快。这不是能力下降，而是能量分配的问题。

**解决思路：**
1. **能量评估**：定期检查自己的社交能量水平
2. **优先级排序**：把有限的社交能量用在最重要的关系上
3. **质量替代数量**：减少社交频率，但提高每次社交的质量
4. **明确沟通**：直接告知朋友当前的能量状态，设定合理的期望
5. **能量补充**：找到适合自己的社交充电方式

你最后成功安排了聚会，正是因为你找到了适合自己的社交节奏。这不是社交能力的问题，而是你学会了如何在当前生活阶段有效管理社交能量。

记住：社交不是比赛，而是找到适合自己的平衡点。你的"社交能量管理"方式，正是你独特的生活智慧。

[P1] You're here for tips on leveling up your career, but here's a bonus tip on leveling up your investments.
[P2] Check out Public.
[P3] Public is an investing platform where you can invest in stocks, options, bonds, ETFs, and crypto all in one place.
[P4] Public is a modern brokerage and has brought innovation to aspects of investing that were dinosaur-y.
[P5] I'll give you an example.
[P6] Public is one of the only brokerages to offer self-directed investing in bonds, even treasuries, which have historically been sold primarily through a government website.
[P7] But with Public, you can invest in treasuries with just a few clicks right from your phone.
[P8] And public allows you to make fractional investments in bonds.
[P9] So before fractional bonds on public, you had to buy government bonds starting with a $1,000 investment at a minimum.
[P10] And if you wanted to invest in any more than that, you could only invest in $100 increments.
[P11] Now you can buy bonds for as little as $100 and for any dollar amount on public.
[P12] That's just one example of how public is making it easier to invest, but there are a ton more and you can explore them for yourself at public.com slash help wanted.
[P13] To get started with your portfolio today, go to public.com slash help wanted.
[P14] This is a paid endorsement for public investing.
[P15] Full disclosure and conditions can be found in the podcast description.
[P16] Doesn't it feel like every time you step out the door, you have to pay a fee?
[P17] I mean, it is nuts.
[P18] I've been traveling a lot for the holidays and the amount of fees I pay just to get from point A to point B, it is mind boggling.

[P41] On Tuesdays, Jason and I answer the helpline and help callers solve their work problems.
[P42] And on Thursdays, I give you one way to improve your work and build a career or company you love.
[P43] And it starts now.

[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.

主题：社交能力指数：你的‘计划执行力’及格了吗？ - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.

[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.

[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.

[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.

分析结果：
### 简化社交困境的独特视角：**物理距离的魔力**

#### 问题核心
两对夫妇聚会时，对话容易分裂成“妻子对妻子”和“丈夫对丈夫”的单独交流，导致部分人感到不适或无聊。

#### 独特观察角度
**物理距离的调整**可以强制对话保持整体性，避免分裂。

#### 解决步骤
1. **保持适当距离**：在聚会时，确保所有人坐得足够远，无法自然形成小圈子对话。例如，10英尺的距离可以迫使大家保持整体交流。
2. **明确规则**：在聚会开始时，明确宣布“无侧聊”规则，提醒所有人保持整体对话。
3. **设计活动**：安排需要所有人参与的活动或游戏，避免对话分裂。例如，桌游或集体讨论话题。
4. **轮流引导**：指定一个人负责引导对话，确保每个人都有机会发言，避免某些人主导或沉默。
5. **反馈机制**：聚会结束后，询问大家的感受，调整下一次聚会的安排，确保所有人都感到舒适和参与。

#### 结论
通过调整物理距离和明确规则，可以有效地避免对话分裂，创造更和谐和有趣的聚会氛围。

输入内容：
[P1] You're here for tips on leveling up your career, but here's a bonus tip on leveling up your investments.
[P2] Check out Public.
[P3] Public is an investing platform where you can invest in stocks, options, bonds, ETFs, and crypto all in one place.
[P4] Public is a modern brokerage and has brought innovation to aspects of investing that were dinosaur-y.
[P5] I'll give you an example.
[P6] Public is one of the only brokerages to offer self-directed investing in bonds, even treasuries, which have historically been sold primarily through a government website.
[P7] But with Public, you can invest in treasuries with just a few clicks right from your phone.
[P8] And public allows you to make fractional investments in bonds.
[P9] So before fractional bonds on public, you had to buy government bonds starting with a $1,000 investment at a minimum.
[P10] And if you wanted to invest in any more than that, you could only invest in $100 increments.
[P11] Now you can buy bonds for as little as $100 and for any dollar amount on public.
[P12] That's just one example of how public is making it easier to invest, but there are a ton more and you can explore them for yourself at public.com slash help wanted.
[P13] To get started with your portfolio today, go to public.com slash help wanted.
[P14] This is a paid endorsement for public investing.
[P15] Full disclosure and conditions can be found in the podcast description.
[P16] Doesn't it feel like every time you step out the door, you have to pay a fee?
[P17] I mean, it is nuts.
[P18] I've been traveling a lot for the holidays and the amount of fees I pay just to get from point A to point B, it is mind boggling.
[P19] And it makes it really hard to stick with my spending plan.

[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.

[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.

分析结果：
从这段对话中，我们可以看到一个独特的观察角度：**社交计划的复杂性往往源于个体对社交能量的管理，而非对关系的真实态度**。很多人并不是不想社交，而是因为社交焦虑、精力管理或生活节奏等原因，导致他们难以做出或履行社交计划。这种现象在现代社会中尤为普遍，尤其是在生活节奏快、压力大的环境中。

### 核心洞察：
1. **社交焦虑与精力管理**：许多人在面对社交计划时，会感到焦虑或不确定自己是否能在特定时间点有足够的精力参与。这种焦虑可能导致他们拖延或回避计划的确认。
2. **社交能力指数**：每个人的社交能力在不同生活阶段会有所波动。忙碌的生活、家庭责任或工作压力可能会降低一个人的社交能力，使其难以有效沟通或履行计划。
3. **社交动态的复杂性**：在涉及多人的社交计划中（如夫妻或家庭），个体的社交意愿和焦虑可能会相互影响，导致计划的难以落实。

### 简化解决方案：
1. **明确沟通**：在提出社交计划时，明确表达自己的期望和时间安排，减少不确定性。
2. **理解与包容**：理解对方可能面临的社交焦虑或生活压力，避免过度解读对方的行为。
3. **灵活安排**：尝试更灵活的社交方式，如短时间的聚会或非正式的活动，降低对方的心理负担。

通过这个角度，我们可以更轻松地理解社交计划中的种种“拖延”和“回避”，并找到更有效的沟通和安排方式。

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
- 社交互动 = 个体A + 个体B + 关系动态
- 不匹配 = 个体A ≈ 个体B - 共同兴趣
- 对话分裂 = 群体对话 → 子群体对话
- 强制统一 = 群体对话 ↔ 禁止子群体对话

### 逻辑链条构建
1. 社交互动中的不匹配（个体A ≈ 个体B - 共同兴趣）导致不适感
2. 不适感 → 个体A选择回避或掩盖真实感受
3. 对话分裂（群体对话 → 子群体对话）加剧不匹配
4. 强制统一（群体对话 ↔ 禁止子群体对话）试图解决分裂问题

### 知识精髓提炼
社交互动中的核心问题在于不匹配和对话分裂，强制统一是一种解决方案，但可能带来新的社交压力。关键在于找到平衡点，使得群体对话既能保持统一，又能容纳个体差异。

主题：社交能力指数：你的‘计划执行力’及格了吗？ - essence

输入内容：
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.

[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.

[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考"社交能力指数"这个概念的本质。

从演化角度看，社交能力源于人类作为社会性动物的生存需求。在原始部落中，有效沟通和协作是生存的关键。这种能力在演化过程中被保留并发展，成为人类的基本特质。

从矛盾分析，社交能力的主要矛盾在于：个体自我认知与实际表现之间的差距。人们往往高估或低估自己的社交能力，这种认知偏差导致了社交中的诸多问题。

从存在主义视角，社交能力的存在理由是维系社会关系、实现自我价值。它是人类在社会中生存和发展的基本工具。

通过现象学还原，褪去表象，我们看到社交能力的本质是：个体在社会互动中有效表达、理解并回应他人需求的能力。

因此，社交能力指数的本质定义是：衡量个体在社会互动中有效沟通、协调和执行社交计划的能力水平，反映了个体在社会关系中的适应性和效能。

这个定义揭示了社交能力的核心要素：沟通、协调和执行，以及其作为社会适应性的衡量标准。它帮助我们理解为什么在不同生活阶段，人们的社交能力会发生变化，以及如何客观评估和提升自己的社交能力。

[P1] You're here for tips on leveling up your career, but here's a bonus tip on leveling up your investments.
[P2] Check out Public.
[P3] Public is an investing platform where you can invest in stocks, options, bonds, ETFs, and crypto all in one place.
[P4] Public is a modern brokerage and has brought innovation to aspects of investing that were dinosaur-y.
[P5] I'll give you an example.
[P6] Public is one of the only brokerages to offer self-directed investing in bonds, even treasuries, which have historically been sold primarily through a government website.
[P7] But with Public, you can invest in treasuries with just a few clicks right from your phone.
[P8] And public allows you to make fractional investments in bonds.
[P9] So before fractional bonds on public, you had to buy government bonds starting with a $1,000 investment at a minimum.
[P10] And if you wanted to invest in any more than that, you could only invest in $100 increments.
[P11] Now you can buy bonds for as little as $100 and for any dollar amount on public.
[P12] That's just one example of how public is making it easier to invest, but there are a ton more and you can explore them for yourself at public.com slash help wanted.
[P13] To get started with your portfolio today, go to public.com slash help wanted.
[P14] This is a paid endorsement for public investing.
[P15] Full disclosure and conditions can be found in the podcast description.
[P16] Doesn't it feel like every time you step out the door, you have to pay a fee?
[P17] I mean, it is nuts.
[P18] I've been traveling a lot for the holidays and the amount of fees I pay just to get from point A to point B, it is mind boggling.
[P19] And it makes it really hard to stick with my spending plan.
[P20] When we're trying to make progress, life's curve balls often feel like taking one step forward and two steps back.
[P21] A chime checking account makes financial progress easier with features like no maintenance fees, fee-free overdraft up to $200,

[P39] I'm Jason Pfeiffer, editor-in-chief of Entrepreneur Magazine.
[P40] And I'm money expert, Nicole Lappin.
[P41] On Tuesdays, Jason and I answer the helpline and help callers solve their work problems.
[P42] And on Thursdays, I give you one way to improve your work and build a career or company you love.
[P43] And it starts now.

[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.

分析结果：
从演化分析来看，社交对话的分裂现象源于人类早期群体生活中的分工需求，男性多从事狩猎等体力活动，女性多从事采集等细致工作，这种分工模式在潜意识中延续至今。从矛盾分析来看，群体对话中存在集体交流与个体交流的矛盾，每个人都希望参与整体对话，但又容易被特定话题吸引而陷入小范围交流。从存在理由来看，群体对话的分裂反映了人类社交中既渴望群体归属又追求个体表达的深层需求。通过现象学还原，我们发现群体对话的本质是信息交流与情感联结的统一过程。从属和种差来看，群体对话是一种多主体参与的、动态平衡的社交互动形式，其特殊性在于既要维持整体性又要包容个体性。

主题：从投资到社交：当代人如何应对‘承诺恐惧症’？ - analogy

输入内容：
[P1] You're here for tips on leveling up your career, but here's a bonus tip on leveling up your investments.
[P2] Check out Public.
[P3] Public is an investing platform where you can invest in stocks, options, bonds, ETFs, and crypto all in one place.
[P4] Public is a modern brokerage and has brought innovation to aspects of investing that were dinosaur-y.
[P5] I'll give you an example.
[P6] Public is one of the only brokerages to offer self-directed investing in bonds, even treasuries, which have historically been sold primarily through a government website.
[P7] But with Public, you can invest in treasuries with just a few clicks right from your phone.
[P8] And public allows you to make fractional investments in bonds.
[P9] So before fractional bonds on public, you had to buy government bonds starting with a $1,000 investment at a minimum.
[P10] And if you wanted to invest in any more than that, you could only invest in $100 increments.
[P11] Now you can buy bonds for as little as $100 and for any dollar amount on public.
[P12] That's just one example of how public is making it easier to invest, but there are a ton more and you can explore them for yourself at public.com slash help wanted.
[P13] To get started with your portfolio today, go to public.com slash help wanted.
[P14] This is a paid endorsement for public investing.
[P15] Full disclosure and conditions can be found in the podcast description.
[P16] Doesn't it feel like every time you step out the door, you have to pay a fee?
[P17] I mean, it is nuts.
[P18] I've been traveling a lot for the holidays and the amount of fees I pay just to get from point A to point B, it is mind boggling.
[P19] And it makes it really hard to stick with my spending plan.
[P20] When we're trying to make progress, life's curve balls often feel like taking one step forward and two steps back.
[P21] A chime checking account makes financial progress easier with features like no maintenance fees, fee-free overdraft up to $200,
[P22] or getting paid up to two days early with direct deposit.
[P23] Learn more at chime.com slash help wanted.
[P24] And once you go to chime.com slash help wanted, you'll learn more about the fee-free overdraft up to $200.
[P25] And let me tell you, that is such a game changer.
[P26] Make progress towards a better financial future with Chime.
[P27] Open your account in two minutes at chime.com slash helpwanted.
[P28] That's chime.com slash helpwanted.

分析结果：
就像一场音乐会，本该是四重奏，却常常变成两个二重唱。每个人都该在同一个舞台上演奏，而不是各自为政。保持距离反而让声音更和谐，这真是讽刺。就像疫情期间的社交距离，意外地创造了一个平等的对话空间。现在距离消失了，对话却分裂了。我们需要一个指挥家，时刻提醒大家保持合奏，而不是各自独奏。

主题：社交能力指数：你的‘计划执行力’及格了吗？ - analogy

输入内容：
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.

[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.

分析结果：
就像一辆车在高速公路上行驶，我们每个人都有一个社交能力的"档位"。有些人天生就是五档，轻松自如；有些人则是三档，略显吃力。但当我们进入人生的"施工区"——忙于事业或家庭时，档位会自动降两档。五档的人变成了三档，三档的人可能就只剩一档了。有趣的是，我们往往还误以为自己仍在原来的档位上，就像司机忘记已经换挡，还在期待同样的速度。但意识到这一点，就像看到仪表盘上的档位显示，能让我们更好地理解彼此，调整期待。最终，当我们找到合适的档位，社交就像顺畅的换挡，变得轻松自然。

主题：夫妻社交困境：当‘四人约会’变成心理博弈 - essence

输入内容：
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.

[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考这个社交互动的本质。从演化角度看，人类作为群居动物，社交互动是生存和繁衍的基本需求。然而，现代社交场景中的"分桌对话"现象，揭示了社交互动中一个深层的矛盾：群体归属感与个体舒适度之间的张力。

通过现象学还原，我们可以褪去表面的社交礼仪，看到这种现象的本质：它反映了人类在群体互动中寻求个人认同与群体和谐之间的永恒困境。当个体在群体中感到不适时，往往会本能地寻找更舒适的小群体互动，这实际上是一种自我保护机制。

从存在主义的角度看，这种现象的存在源于人类对真实交流的渴望。当个体感到无法在群体中找到共鸣时，就会自然地转向更小范围的交流。这既是人类追求真实连接的体现，也是个体在群体中寻求自我认同的表现。

因此，我们可以这样定义"分桌对话"现象：它是人类在群体社交中，为寻求个体舒适度和真实连接而产生的一种自发性的小群体互动模式，反映了群体归属感与个体认同感之间的内在矛盾。

这个本质定义揭示了现代社交互动中的一个核心困境：如何在保持群体和谐的同时，尊重每个个体的舒适度和交流需求。理解这一点，或许能帮助我们更好地设计社交场景，创造更和谐的群体互动体验。

输入内容：
[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.

[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.

分析结果：
就像一场四重奏，每个乐器都要和谐共鸣，而不是各自为政。社交聚会也是如此，需要全体参与的交响乐，而非分裂的独奏。保持距离反而让对话凝聚，就像疫情时期的十英尺间隔，迫使大家共同演奏。要防止对话分裂，就得像指挥家一样，果断喊停旁枝末节，让主旋律始终清晰。没有旁白，只有合奏，这才是完美的社交乐章。

主题：社交能力指数：你的‘计划执行力’及格了吗？ - contemplator

输入内容：
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.

[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?

分析结果：
### 现状分析

在这个快节奏的社会里，我们每个人都像是被卷入了一场无休止的马拉松。工作、家庭、社交，各种责任和期待压得我们喘不过气来。尤其是在这个“创造”的阶段，我们都在拼命地往前冲，仿佛停下来就意味着失败。这种忙碌和压力，无形中削弱了我们的社交能力，让我们在与人交往时显得力不从心。

### 个体剖析

你提到的“社交能力指数”这个概念，确实戳中了很多人的痛点。我们每个人都有自己的社交能力基线，但在某些特定的生活阶段，这个指数会大幅下降。比如，你原本是个“五”，但在忙碌的生活中，你可能已经降到了“二”。问题是，我们往往意识不到这一点，还以为自己依然是那个“六”或“七”。这种自我认知的偏差，导致了我们在社交中的种种尴尬和误解。

### 群体透视

从更广泛的社会视角来看，这种现象并不是个例。我们生活在一个高度连接但又极度疏离的时代。社交媒体让我们可以随时随地和他人保持联系，但真正的面对面交流却变得越来越少。我们都在忙着“创造”，忙着追求所谓的成功，却忽略了人与人之间最基本的情感连接。这种社会发展的动力，某种程度上加剧了我们的社交困境。

### 思考整合

综合来看，社交能力的下降并不是我们个人的问题，而是整个社会结构和生活方式的产物。我们都在拼命往前跑，却忘了停下来看看身边的人。你提到的“社交能力指数”提醒我们，需要重新审视自己的社交状态，意识到自己在忙碌生活中的变化。只有这样，我们才能真正理解彼此，找到一种更健康、更平衡的社交方式。

### 金句

“我们都在拼命往前跑，却忘了停下来看看身边的人。”

主题：从投资到社交：当代人如何应对‘承诺恐惧症’？ - contemplator

输入内容：
[P1] You're here for tips on leveling up your career, but here's a bonus tip on leveling up your investments.
[P2] Check out Public.
[P3] Public is an investing platform where you can invest in stocks, options, bonds, ETFs, and crypto all in one place.
[P4] Public is a modern brokerage and has brought innovation to aspects of investing that were dinosaur-y.
[P5] I'll give you an example.
[P6] Public is one of the only brokerages to offer self-directed investing in bonds, even treasuries, which have historically been sold primarily through a government website.
[P7] But with Public, you can invest in treasuries with just a few clicks right from your phone.
[P8] And public allows you to make fractional investments in bonds.
[P9] So before fractional bonds on public, you had to buy government bonds starting with a $1,000 investment at a minimum.
[P10] And if you wanted to invest in any more than that, you could only invest in $100 increments.
[P11] Now you can buy bonds for as little as $100 and for any dollar amount on public.
[P12] That's just one example of how public is making it easier to invest, but there are a ton more and you can explore them for yourself at public.com slash help wanted.
[P13] To get started with your portfolio today, go to public.com slash help wanted.
[P14] This is a paid endorsement for public investing.
[P15] Full disclosure and conditions can be found in the podcast description.
[P16] Doesn't it feel like every time you step out the door, you have to pay a fee?
[P17] I mean, it is nuts.
[P18] I've been traveling a lot for the holidays and the amount of fees I pay just to get from point A to point B, it is mind boggling.
[P19] And it makes it really hard to stick with my spending plan.
[P20] When we're trying to make progress, life's curve balls often feel like taking one step forward and two steps back.
[P21] A chime checking account makes financial progress easier with features like no maintenance fees, fee-free overdraft up to $200,
[P22] or getting paid up to two days early with direct deposit.
[P23] Learn more at chime.com slash help wanted.
[P24] And once you go to chime.com slash help wanted, you'll learn more about the fee-free overdraft up to $200.
[P25] And let me tell you, that is such a game changer.
[P26] Make progress towards a better financial future with Chime.
[P27] Open your account in two minutes at chime.com slash helpwanted.
[P28] That's chime.com slash helpwanted.
[P29] Chime.
[P30] Feels like progress.
[P31] Banking services and debit card provided by the BankCorp Bank N.A.
[P32] or Stride Bank N.A.
[P33] Members FDIC.
[P34] SpotMe eligibility requirements and overdraft limits apply.
[P35] Boosts are available to eligible Chime members enrolled in SpotMe and are subject to monthly limits.
[P36] Timing depends on submission of payment file.
[P37] Fees apply at out-of-network ATMs.
[P38] This is Help Wanted, the show that makes your work work for you.
[P39] I'm Jason Pfeiffer, editor-in-chief of Entrepreneur Magazine.
[P40] And I'm money expert, Nicole Lappin.
[P41] On Tuesdays, Jason and I answer the helpline and help callers solve their work problems.
[P42] And on Thursdays, I give you one way to improve your work and build a career or company you love.
[P43] And it starts now.

[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.

分析结果：
在这个看似简单的社交场景中，我们其实可以看到现代社会中人际关系的微妙变化和深层矛盾。表面上，我们讨论的是如何在四人聚会中避免对话分裂成男女两组的尴尬局面，但背后反映的却是我们对社交效率和深度的焦虑。

首先，让我们看看这个问题的根源。为什么在四人聚会中，对话会自然地分裂成男女两组？这不仅仅是性别差异的问题，更是我们内心深处对社交效率的追求。我们习惯了快速分类和标签化，以便在复杂的社交环境中找到自己的位置。这种分裂实际上是我们对社交效率的一种妥协，因为我们默认了性别是划分社交圈的最简单标准。

然而，这种分裂带来的问题显而易见。它限制了我们的社交深度，使得我们无法真正了解彼此的全貌。就像COVID期间，由于物理距离的限制，四人必须保持统一的对话，反而创造了一种更为平等和深入的交流方式。这让我们意识到，真正的社交深度往往需要打破我们习以为常的分类和标签。

那么，如何避免这种对话分裂呢？Jason提出的“禁止侧聊”策略看似简单，实则是对现代社交习惯的一种挑战。它要求我们在社交场合中保持更高的专注度和参与度，而不是任由对话自然分裂。这种策略的成功与否，取决于我们是否愿意放弃对社交效率的追求，转而追求更为真实和深入的交流。

然而，这种策略也暴露了现代社交的另一个深层矛盾：我们对社交深度的渴望与对社交效率的追求之间的矛盾。在快节奏的现代生活中，我们往往希望在最短的时间内获得最大的社交收益，这种心态使得我们难以真正投入到深度交流中。我们习惯了快速切换话题，习惯了在对话中寻找最有效的沟通方式，却忽略了真正的交流需要时间和耐心。

最终，这个看似简单的社交问题，其实反映了现代社会中人际关系的复杂性和矛盾性。我们渴望深度交流，却又追求社交效率；我们想要打破性别标签，却又习惯了快速分类。或许，真正的解决方案并不在于如何避免对话分裂，而在于我们是否愿意放下对社交效率的执着，真正投入到每一次交流中。只有这样，我们才能在四人聚会中创造出真正平等和深入的交流氛围，而不是被性别标签和社交效率所束缚。

主题：现代社交焦虑：为何我们越来越难敲定朋友聚会？ - essence

输入内容：
[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.

[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.

分析结果：
从这段对话中，我们可以分析出几个本质性的问题：

1. **社交焦虑的本质**：社交焦虑不仅仅是对社交场合的恐惧，更是对不确定性和自我评价的过度关注。它源于对他人评价的敏感和对自我表现的担忧，导致人们在面对社交计划时产生犹豫和拖延。

2. **计划困难的核心**：计划困难的核心在于人们对时间和精力的不确定性。现代生活的忙碌和多重角色使得人们难以预测未来的状态，因此对计划的承诺变得犹豫不决。这种不确定性进一步加剧了社交焦虑。

3. **社交能力的动态性**：社交能力并非固定不变，而是随着生活阶段和环境的变化而波动。在高压或忙碌的时期，人们的社交能力会显著下降，导致计划难以落实。这种动态性使得社交互动变得更加复杂。

4. **社交互动的矛盾**：社交互动中存在一种内在矛盾：人们渴望连接，但又害怕被消耗。这种矛盾导致了社交计划中的推拉现象，即表面上表达兴趣，实际上却难以付诸行动。

5. **社交关系的本质**：社交关系的本质在于双方的匹配度。无论是个人还是夫妻，社交计划的成功与否取决于双方的需求和舒适度是否一致。这种匹配度决定了社交互动的深度和持续性。

总结来说，社交计划的困难源于人类对不确定性、自我评价和精力管理的复杂心理机制，而这些机制在现代社会中尤为突出。

分析结果：
### 现状分析
在现代社交中，两对夫妇聚会时，常常会出现一种尴尬的局面：妻子们和丈夫们各自形成小圈子，导致整体交流的割裂。这种现象不仅让参与者感到不适，还可能影响友谊的深度和质量。特别是在COVID期间，由于社交距离的限制，人们被迫保持一定的距离，反而促进了更均衡的群体交流。

### 个体剖析
从个体角度来看，每个人在社交场合中的舒适度和兴趣点各不相同。有些人可能不愿意与某些人交流，或者感到被迫参与不感兴趣的对话。这种不适感会导致他们在聚会中显得被动或冷漠，甚至可能选择回避未来的社交活动。此外，个体之间的化学反应也至关重要，缺乏共同话题或兴趣点会使得交流变得生硬和尴尬。

### 群体透视
从群体角度来看，社交活动的成功与否往往取决于群体动态的平衡。当交流被割裂成小圈子时，整体的互动质量会大打折扣。这种现象反映了社会中更深层次的社交习惯和性别角色分工。传统的性别角色分工可能使得妻子们和丈夫们在社交场合中自然而然地形成各自的圈子，而忽视了整体交流的重要性。

### 思考整合
要解决这种社交割裂的问题，首先需要意识到其存在并主动采取措施。例如，通过明确禁止小圈子对话，强制保持整体交流的连贯性。此外，创造一种平等的交流环境，鼓励每个人参与整体对话，而不是局限于性别或兴趣的小圈子。这不仅能够提升社交活动的质量，还能促进更深层次的友谊和理解。

### 核心洞察
社交割裂的根源在于传统的性别角色分工和个体舒适度的差异。要打破这种局面，需要主动调整社交习惯，创造平等的交流环境，确保每个人都能参与并享受整体对话。这不仅是对个体舒适度的尊重，也是对群体动态的优化。

主题：现代社交焦虑：为何我们越来越难敲定朋友聚会？ - analogy

输入内容：
[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.

[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.

分析结果：
就像在玩一场永远无法结束的捉迷藏游戏，每个人都躲在各自的焦虑和忙碌中，互相寻找却总是错过。社交计划就像一场精心编排的舞蹈，但舞步总是错乱，节奏总是失调。有人害怕迈出第一步，有人担心踩到对方的脚，还有人干脆躲在角落里，假装自己不在场。这场舞蹈的规则复杂得像迷宫，而每个人都在迷宫中迷失，寻找着出口却总是绕回原点。

主题：社交能力指数：你的‘计划执行力’及格了吗？ - doubt

输入内容：
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.

[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.

[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.

[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来解构这个"社交能力指数"理论：

1. **概念定义问题**
   - "社交能力"被狭隘地定义为"制定和履行社交计划的能力"，这忽略了其他重要维度，如共情、倾听、建立深层关系等。
   - 将复杂的人类社交能力简化为1-10的线性评分，可能过度简化了现实。

2. **假设的合理性**
   - 认为"忙碌时期社交能力会下降2-3分"这一论断缺乏实证支持。
   - 假设人们无法准确评估自己的社交能力，这本身也需要验证。

3. **逻辑推理漏洞**
   - 从"忙碌"直接推导出"社交能力下降"，忽略了个人差异和适应能力。
   - 将社交困难归因于"能力指数下降"，可能忽视了其他因素，如优先级选择或个人偏好。

4. **实践中的矛盾**
   - 对话最后展现的轻松社交互动，与理论中描述的"能力下降"形成鲜明对比。
   - 这种自相矛盾表明，该理论可能无法全面解释现实中的社交现象。

5. **建设性建议**
   - 建议采用更全面、多维度的社交能力评估框架。
   - 考虑将环境因素、个人发展阶段等纳入分析，而非简单归因于"能力指数"。
   - 重视个体差异，避免将复杂的人类社交行为过度简化为线性评分。

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们不仅识别了理论中的问题，也为更深入理解社交能力提供了新的思考方向。

主题：从投资到社交：当代人如何应对‘承诺恐惧症’？ - doubt

输入内容：
[P1] You're here for tips on leveling up your career, but here's a bonus tip on leveling up your investments.
[P2] Check out Public.
[P3] Public is an investing platform where you can invest in stocks, options, bonds, ETFs, and crypto all in one place.
[P4] Public is a modern brokerage and has brought innovation to aspects of investing that were dinosaur-y.
[P5] I'll give you an example.
[P6] Public is one of the only brokerages to offer self-directed investing in bonds, even treasuries, which have historically been sold primarily through a government website.
[P7] But with Public, you can invest in treasuries with just a few clicks right from your phone.
[P8] And public allows you to make fractional investments in bonds.
[P9] So before fractional bonds on public, you had to buy government bonds starting with a $1,000 investment at a minimum.
[P10] And if you wanted to invest in any more than that, you could only invest in $100 increments.
[P11] Now you can buy bonds for as little as $100 and for any dollar amount on public.
[P12] That's just one example of how public is making it easier to invest, but there are a ton more and you can explore them for yourself at public.com slash help wanted.
[P13] To get started with your portfolio today, go to public.com slash help wanted.
[P14] This is a paid endorsement for public investing.

[P17] I mean, it is nuts.
[P18] I've been traveling a lot for the holidays and the amount of fees I pay just to get from point A to point B, it is mind boggling.
[P19] And it makes it really hard to stick with my spending plan.
[P20] When we're trying to make progress, life's curve balls often feel like taking one step forward and two steps back.

[P39] I'm Jason Pfeiffer, editor-in-chief of Entrepreneur Magazine.
[P40] And I'm money expert, Nicole Lappin.
[P41] On Tuesdays, Jason and I answer the helpline and help callers solve their work problems.
[P42] And on Thursdays, I give you one way to improve your work and build a career or company you love.
[P43] And it starts now.

[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.

分析结果：
让我们对这个对话进行系统性分析：

1. **概念澄清**
   - 对话涉及两个主要话题：投资平台Public的推广和社交互动中的对话模式
   - 需要区分商业推广内容和真实社交场景讨论

2. **概念溯源**
   - Public平台的推广部分明显是付费广告，符合现代播客的商业模式

6. **建设性建议**
   - 对于投资：在追求便利的同时，更要注重金融素养的提升
   - 对于社交：可以尝试新的对话方式，但不必完全否定传统模式
   - 最重要的是培养真诚交流的能力，而不是过度关注形式

主题：夫妻社交困境：当‘四人约会’变成心理博弈 - doubt

输入内容：
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.

[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.

分析结果：
让我们从多个角度来解构这个社交困境：

1. **定义澄清**
- "社交分裂"指的是群体对话自然分成小团体的现象
- "无侧聊"是一种主动维持整体对话的策略

2. 概念溯源
- 社交分裂源于人类自然的群体互动模式
- COVID时期的物理距离无意中创造了一种新的对话模式

3. 解构假设
- 假设1：夫妻必须各自成对交流
   - 质疑：这种模式是否必要？是否存在更好的替代方案？
- 假设2：社交分裂不可避免
   - 质疑：是否有方法可以主动引导对话走向？

4. 辩证分析
- 正面：社交分裂让内向者更舒适，允许深度交流
- 反面：可能造成群体分裂，降低整体互动质量

5. 建设性建议
- 采用"无侧聊"策略，主动维护整体对话
- 创造物理环境（如圆桌）促进群体互动
- 设计引导性问题，吸引所有人参与
- 定期切换话题，保持对话活力

6. 更深层思考
- 这种社交困境反映了现代社会中的人际关系复杂性
- 我们需要在个人舒适与群体和谐之间寻找平衡
- 也许应该重新思考传统社交模式，探索更灵活的互动方式

最终结论：
社交分裂并非不可改变的自然法则。通过主动引导和适当策略，我们可以创造更富有成效、更包容的群体互动体验。关键在于平衡个体需求与群体和谐，同时保持开放和灵活的态度。

主题：现代社交焦虑：为何我们越来越难敲定朋友聚会？ - contemplator

输入内容：
[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.

[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.

分析结果：
这段对话揭示了现代社会中一个普遍但鲜少被深入探讨的现象：**社交焦虑与计划制定的复杂性**。表面上，这只是一场关于“为什么有些人总是难以制定计划”的讨论，但背后却折射出更深层次的社会心理问题。

### 1. **社交焦虑的隐形枷锁**
Katie提到，她对社交计划的犹豫源于**社交焦虑**。她害怕在社交场合中表现不佳，担心自己会说错话、不被喜欢，甚至担心自己会在计划的时间点突然“不想去”。这种焦虑并非个例，而是许多人在面对新关系或不熟悉的社交场合时的共同体验。社交焦虑像一种隐形的枷锁，束缚了人们主动建立联系的意愿，甚至让一些人在面对邀请时选择逃避或拖延。

然而，这种焦虑并非单向的。Jen的焦虑则表现为**对被拒绝的恐惧**。她担心别人不想和她见面，甚至将对方的拖延解读为“他们其实并不想和我交往”。这种“被拒绝”的恐惧与Katie的“社交表现焦虑”形成了一种恶性循环：一方因为焦虑而拖延，另一方则将拖延解读为拒绝，最终导致双方都陷入误解和失望。

### 2. **社会节奏与“社交能力指数”的下降**
Jason提出的“社交能力指数”概念非常有趣。他指出，现代生活的快节奏和高压力让许多人的社交能力“降级”了。即使一个人曾经擅长制定计划，在繁忙的生活中，他们也可能变得拖延或难以跟进。这种“降级”并非因为他们不再重视社交，而是因为他们的**精力被其他优先级更高的任务占据**。

这种“社交能力下降”的现象在对话中得到了印证。无论是Katie的犹豫，还是Jen的失望，都反映了现代人在社交中的挣扎。我们生活在一个信息过载、任务繁重的时代，社交计划往往被挤到了“待办事项”的末尾。即使我们想要维持关系，时间和精力的匮乏让我们难以付诸行动。

### 3. **社交中的“权力动态”与隐性规则**
对话中还揭示了一个更深层次的问题：**社交中的权力动态**。Jen提到，她总是主动发起计划，而对方却很少回应或跟进。这种“单方面努力”的现象让她感到沮丧，甚至怀疑自己是否“不够重要”。这种感受背后，隐藏着社交中的一种隐性规则：**谁主动，谁就处于“弱势”**。主动发起计划的人往往承担了更多的心理负担，而被动回应的人则掌握了“是否参与”的权力。

这种权力动态在夫妻关系中尤为明显。当一对夫妻与另一对夫妻交往时，如果其中一方对另一方不感兴趣，整个计划就可能被搁置。这种“夫妻社交”的复杂性让许多人感到疲惫，甚至选择放弃拓展社交圈。

### 4. **社交的未来：如何打破恶性循环？**
那么，如何打破这种恶性循环？对话中提供了一些线索：
- **理解与共情**：认识到对方的拖延或犹豫并非针对个人，而是源于他们的焦虑或生活压力。
- **简化社交**：减少对计划的期待，接受“临时安排”或“轻松见面”的可能性。
- **打破“夫妻社交”的束缚**：允许个人关系独立于夫妻关系存在，减少对“完美四人组”的执着。

### 5. **核心洞察**
这场对话的核心在于：**社交焦虑与计划制定的困难并非个人问题，而是现代社会的集体困境**。我们生活在一个充满不确定性和高压力的时代，社交能力被不断削弱，而社交中的权力动态则让许多人感到疲惫和失望。要解决这个问题，我们需要更多的理解、更少的期待，以及一种更灵活的社交方式。

最终，社交的本质并非“完美计划”，而是**人与人之间的真实连接**。即使计划被拖延、被取消，只要我们愿意理解彼此，这种连接依然可以存在。

主题：现代社交焦虑：为何我们越来越难敲定朋友聚会？ - doubt

输入内容：
[P44] Hey, Jen, do you remember a few weeks ago when our entire weekend was kind of ruined because you were obsessing over something?
[P45] You're blaming the entire weekend being ruined for my obsession, but yes.
[P46] I'm not blaming you ruining my weekend, but I think that you ruined your weekend because you were obsessing over something.
[P47] That is true.
[P48] There you go.
[P49] Can you remind me what that was?
[P50] Yeah, I was trying to make plans with this mom and her kid.
[P51] It was kind of going to be like a joint family get together.
[P52] Yeah.
[P53] And I could not pin the mom down.
[P54] Right.
[P55] Very frustrating.
[P56] Yeah.
[P57] Right.
[P58] Because she would give you a little bit of information.
[P59] She'd be like, yes, I am available on.
[P60] And then you'd say, great, how about 3 p.m.?
[P61] And then you just could not get her to the point of actual confirmation.
[P62] And so we had in some way kept a lot of our weekend open with the expectation that we would see this family.
[P63] And you just could not get her to the finish line.
[P64] And the reason that the weekend was ruined, so to speak, was because...
[P65] Well, I was convinced and perhaps remain convinced that she didn't actually want to get together with us.
[P66] She was just kind of stringing us along.
[P67] It's like men.
[P68] It's like the bad men that do that to you when you're dating them.
[P69] Right.
[P70] But not me, because I was always very responsive when we were dating.
[P71] OK, that is true.
[P72] Right.
[P73] So now let me let me say a few things here.
[P74] Number one.
[P75] And you are Jen, which is to say you are my wife, Jen Miller, not Nicole Lappin, my usual co-host on this show, because Nicole is on maternity leave.
[P76] So you are once again serving as my special co-host.
[P77] And then number two is we had this debate all that weekend about is this woman...
[P78] ignoring you is she avoiding you or is she just bad at making plans and eventually i said and you took the she is ignoring you side i took the she is just bad at making plans side i said the only way to settle this is to take to the internet and ask the internet so i went on instagram and i i basically just said hello followers
[P79] are you bad at making plans?
[P80] And if so, why?
[P81] And I got a flood of responses.
[P82] And the most exciting and interesting came from my friend, Katie Storino.
[P83] Katie Storino, body acceptance advocate, founder of Mega Babe, and may I just say mega influencer and mega cool person who admitted that she is not very good at making plans and was willing to come on a podcast and explain herself.
[P84] So I have brought Katie on to join us
[P85] Katie, welcome to Help Wanted.
[P86] Hello.
[P87] Hello.
[P88] And I'm so glad, Jen, that you're the special guest with this special topic today.
[P89] This is so up my alley and I have a fresh example to talk about.
[P90] A live unrolling, like it's happening right now.
[P91] Oh, amazing.
[P92] Yeah.
[P93] All right.
[P94] So Katie, let's just kind of set the stage here.
[P95] I think that Jen and you probably represent two very common types of people.
[P96] And I want you to explain yourself because we have heard from Jen.
[P97] But Jen is a very proactive plan maker, as am I. We're reaching out to people all the time to make plans.
[P98] Yeah.
[P99] And a lot of people are just really bad at getting back to us and we cannot figure out what's going on.
[P100] You have admitted to me that you are that person you're very hard to make plans with.
[P101] And I really wanted to bring these sides together to create some kind of understanding about what is happening.
[P102] So before we get into the specific situations that we have all lived, can you just tell us, Katie, why are you so bad at making plans?
[P103] It's a combination of things.
[P104] So we have a live example happening right now.
[P105] A friend who I see probably once a year, she just texted me.
[P106] She's in town.
[P107] She's going to be at this hotel from 4.30 to 5.30.
[P108] Could I stop by for a drink?
[P109] And I immediately was like, okay, let's talk about this in my head.
[P110] I want to see this person.
[P111] I like this person.
[P112] I respect this person.
[P113] I have a good time with this person.
[P114] Oh God, what if at 4.30, which is only in two hours from now, I don't want to do that.
[P115] Oh my God, this is that live.
[P116] Like we're recording at 2.30 right now.
[P117] And this is two hours from now.
[P118] That's what I was saying.
[P119] And she just texted me.
[P120] And I'm like, I like this person, but what if I go and I don't
[P121] I don't, I don't want to go.
[P122] Or like, what if I, what if I immediately, like, what if I'm just like, I want to leave.
[P123] So a lot, Jen, I think a big part of this for me is I've thought about this is that one, I have, I believe social anxiety where it's like a plan is made.
[P124] And then I think about it all day.
[P125] I'm like, Oh God, I wake up and I'm like, but I got that thing at four.
[P126] Hmm.
[P127] And it's just in my brain.
[P128] So I don't feel free the whole day because I got that thing at four.
[P129] And I think something that contributes to like the feeling of I've got that thing at four is hanging out with someone who's new and someone I'm not like totally like comfortable with yet.
[P130] So if it's like I had a plan with my best friend at four, I wouldn't think twice about it.
[P131] If my best friend was like,
[P132] Meet me at this hotel.
[P133] I'd be like, cool.
[P134] I'll meet you wherever.
[P135] But with someone new, I got to put new effort in.
[P136] I got to make conversation.
[P137] Do they like me?
[P138] Am I saying the wrong thing?
[P139] I'm running through so many scenarios in my own head that the whole thing becomes exhausting and I just shut down.
[P140] Wow.
[P141] That's a very interesting insight.
[P142] Because, Jen...
[P143] When I think about who it's really hard to make plans with, it often is kind of newer people.
[P144] Mm-hmm.
[P145] Jen, what do you think about what I said?
[P146] Yeah.
[P147] No, I'm thinking about it.
[P148] Well, so it's really interesting because I also have a lot of social anxiety.
[P149] Okay.
[P150] And my social anxiety manifests as people don't want to hang out with me.
[P151] Which, by the way, the whole fucked up thing about me too is I also feel that people don't want to hang out with me.
[P152] So I will also like reach out to someone and then they don't get back to me.
[P153] And I'm like, well, this is just –
[P154] Like, so I understand that also.
[P155] I mean, I feel like we're in like a chicken and egg situation here.
[P156] Yes.
[P157] Right?
[P158] Because Katie, what you represent is what is causing my anxiety, which is somehow causing you to not want to go out.
[P159] I don't know.
[P160] Because it's just the newness.
[P161] And you're being so brave with your social anxiety, which I understand, by asking someone for plans.
[P162] But we're both kind of in the same boat of like, we're both torturing ourselves and each other with this whole like plan making situation.
[P163] But I guess the question is, how common is it that people have that degree of social anxiety that it's going to really like interfere?
[P164] Because to me, in a way, essentially, doesn't it boil down to the same thing?
[P165] Like, I don't really want to hang out with this person.
[P166] Well, OK.
[P167] And I don't mean that as a criticism of you, Katie.
[P168] Just.
[P169] Yeah.
[P170] Because you just kind of widened the lens here, Jen.
[P171] You're like, what about other people?
[P172] Let me.
[P173] Yeah.
[P174] Let me read to both of you a couple other responses that I got on Instagram.
[P175] I got like a bunch of them.
[P176] So here were some interesting ones.
[P177] All right.
[P178] So Casey said, it's just the way my brain functions.
[P179] I can't make plans too far in advance.
[P180] Did not unpack that further.
[P181] I'm very curious as to why.
[P182] Ilar said, honestly, I would love to hang out with most of my friends who reach out, but given my work and lifestyle, sometimes I can't predict the level of my energy for a given day or night ahead of time.
[P183] Therefore, I refrain from committing 80% of the time unless I'm super comfortable yawning at dinner with that friend and not having to get changed, do makeup, et cetera, knowing they understand and won't be offended or upset, which Katie sort of reminds me of like the comfort that you would have getting together with your best friend.
[P184] Jumada says,
[P185] My response is usually life happens.
[P186] I wear multiple hats.
[P187] I'm a mother, own a few businesses.
[P188] I'm a consultant, et cetera, et cetera.
[P189] I take each day as it comes.
[P190] And if my response is delayed, it's not because I'm intentionally ignoring you.
[P191] I simply don't have the space or energy to respond to that moment.
[P192] When I find a call moment in a day or a week or two, I respond.
[P193] And if it's a true friend, then they understand.
[P194] And then this one was, I thought, especially interesting.
[P195] So Yvonne said this, "'It's not because I don't care about the person.
[P196] It's because I'm juggling my need for connection with my need to recharge.'"
[P197] When my social battery is low, I feel like I have nothing to give and it sucks because I know that might make someone feel like they aren't a priority to me.
[P198] What really stings, Yvonne continues, what really stings is that when I've canceled too many times or procrastinated replying, people often stop inviting me altogether.
[P199] That leaves me feeling left out, which creates this vicious cycle where I wish I'd done better at staying connected in the first place.
[P200] It feels like I can't win.
[P201] I either let people down or I potentially burn myself out of keeping up commitments that I don't have the energy for when the date comes around.
[P202] Okay, thoughts.
[P203] Well, yeah.
[P204] Okay.
[P205] I get that.
[P206] I know that I generally do not want to make plans on a weeknight to go do something that's in any way uncomfortable.
[P207] Because I know that like on a weeknight, I'm usually pretty tired, especially if it involves going outside.
[P208] In the summer, it's easier even, but like in the winter to have to go out after dark, get on the train.
[P209] I would rather just be at home in my sweatpants watching TV.
[P210] I understand the thing about the energy for sure, like needing the energy.
[P211] I just – I can't believe that that many people, Jason, in our lives –
[P212] this issue.
[P213] But it was shocking how many people on Instagram reached out and said, I am bad at making plans.
[P214] People self-identify, like Katie, as just being bad at this.
[P215] And Katie, you're very aware that you're bad at this.
[P216] This is a thing you...
[P217] You're not hiding it.
[P218] I feel awful about it.
[P219] And I also, I'm more confessionals.
[P220] I have a friend who I had dinner with on Wednesday night and she asked me if I want to go to the beach this weekend.
[P221] I still haven't replied because I can't predict if I really want to go to the beach or not.
[P222] I'm stuck.
[P223] Jen, I agree with you that this seems like a really strange affliction for so many people to have.
[P224] But clearly they have it, I guess.
[P225] I don't know.
[P226] Or is the truth that the people that you're close with and the people that you're comfortable with are your people and maybe you don't want to expand outside that circle because you don't have the bandwidth?
[P227] That makes me really sad.
[P228] Like part of this is driven by a desire that I have to create more community.
[P229] I mean, I love our friends.
[P230] And I've heard people talk about like, you know, they get to this point in their lives or in our mid 40s.
[P231] They don't want any more friends.
[P232] They don't need any more friends.
[P233] But first of all, that's not me and it's not Jason.

[P234] Yeah.
[P235] But I think what's particularly strange about this, and so Katie, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[P236] The people that I'm talking about, when you see them in the wild, they give every indication of actually really wanting to spend time with you and hang out with you.
[P237] So the reluctance when it actually comes to pulling the trigger, that's part of what makes it so odd.
[P238] Yeah, like we have, Katie, before you say, I just want to like color that in.
[P239] There's a couple.
[P240] We're just going to call them John and Jane.
[P241] Yeah.
[P242] And we had John and Jane over once like a year ago.
[P243] And it was great.
[P244] Like we just really connected.
[P245] We got personal really fast.
[P246] We loved them.
[P247] And then afterwards, lots of texts.
[P248] That was so great.
[P249] We got to do that again.
[P250] Jen and I have tried to get together with them so many times.
[P251] And each time they either...
[P252] don't respond for a long time.
[P253] Or occasionally we've actually gotten a date on the calendar and then they will back out of it.
[P254] And like, they will never reciprocate the effort.
[P255] Like we are always the ones that are starting the effort, but then we'll run into them on the street.
[P256] Cause you know, we all live in Brooklyn.
[P257] It's small enough.
[P258] And they're like, Oh my God, it's so great to see you.
[P259] We have to get together.
[P260] And it's like, what the hell is happening right now?
[P261] Yeah, I run into the dad like pretty often at school.
[P262] Yeah.
[P263] And the dad is always like, you know, my wife and I, we're always talking about how much fun we had at your house and how cool you guys are.
[P264] And we never meet people that get past the small talk.
[P265] And yeah, it's like we need to get together.
[P266] I'm looking up to see whether I have one of these text chains.
[P267] Yeah.
[P268] Well, because I'm curious, I'm curious as this is my nature.
[P269] So I'd like to see if I can read between the lines about whether or not they're just being nice or if they're like having a meltdown on their own end.
[P270] Because I will also admit that I have done that in person where I run into someone that I don't want to hang out with.
[P271] And I'm like dinner, get it on the calendar, book it, book it, book it, bye.
[P272] But then I know I'm never going to do it.
[P273] Okay, I found this particular text chain.
[P274] Stick around.
[P275] Help Wanted will be right back.
[P276] Welcome back to Help Wanted.
[P277] Let's get to it.
[P278] So basically, Jason started a text chain with the two couples.
[P279] Classic.
[P280] I do this, by the way.
[P281] I love starting a text chain.
[P282] Oh, yeah.
[P283] I love a good text chain.
[P284] Yep.
[P285] Okay.
[P286] So, well, the first thing was, so Jason like threw out a few things.
[P287] Okay.
[P288] So he says, ambitious idea, get sitters and do dinner out on Friday, or we could do a weeknight the next few weeks.
[P289] Pretty flexible.
[P290] That was on Sunday, September 8th.
[P291] OK, basically, then like at some point later that day, it was Jason.
[P292] Our day was a wash.
[P293] Our weekend consisted of house cleaning, wrangling very cranky girls.
[P294] We got nothing off the ground.
[P295] Daughter one had a friend's birthday thing in the park midday today.
[P296] And our Saturday walk to the farmer's market was not as magical as we were hoping for.
[P297] It felt like the stars were not aligned.
[P298] WTF.
[P299] But but we would love to make a plan and follow through.
[P300] Let's make it happen.
[P301] So we were like, oh, so that's too bad.
[P302] Let's follow up.
[P303] And you throw out a couple other dates.
[P304] I threw out specific dates.
[P305] Yeah.
[P306] They like kind of blow past a lot of that.
[P307] But then they come back and they do actually attempt to make plans.
[P308] And by the way, this is how much how much this is.
[P309] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P310] Yeah.
[P311] A couple of weeks have gone by.
[P312] Is it still in September?
[P313] Yeah.
[P314] It's still in September.
[P315] I wrote them on the on the 9th.
[P316] It's now the 20th.
[P317] Okay.
[P318] Okay.
[P319] Right.
[P320] So Jane, Jane says, forgive us.
[P321] It took a long time to get back to you.
[P322] Are you still free on one of the dates?
[P323] We could have you over whatever you prefer.
[P324] And if that date doesn't work, no worries.
[P325] We will find alternative to exclamation marks.
[P326] We respond with like, let's do it.
[P327] Yeah.
[P328] And then a couple of days go by.
[P329] We don't hear from them.
[P330] Jen follows up a couple more days go by.
[P331] So now so they have been the ones to throw out the date.
[P332] Yeah.
[P333] And you replied to the dates.
[P334] You're like, yes, we can do.
[P335] We said we're free thinking kids are no kids.
[P336] We'd happily do no kids.
[P337] But no, it isn't always easy to get sitters.
[P338] That was on that.
[P339] OK.
[P340] And then four days later, we haven't heard from them.
[P341] They didn't respond to that.
[P342] Sorry.
[P343] Are your kids all the same age?
[P344] Ish.
[P345] Yeah.
[P346] Ish.
[P347] Okay.
[P348] So if you did like a with kids thing, your kids can like sit all in a room and like do something.
[P349] Yeah.
[P350] Yeah.
[P351] So then I was like, hey guys, following up, what do you think about kids?
[P352] No kids on Saturday.
[P353] That's Tuesday.
[P354] Thursday.
[P355] Oh, God.
[P356] Jen, Jason, I think we may need to beg off to another night.
[P357] We're just wiped out.
[P358] British.
[P359] Between last weekend's camping and then hitting the ground immediately without a break this week and work and the kids, I think we're pooped.
[P360] It's ironic.
[P361] I mean, this is a dissertation.
[P362] It's ironic because other friends just wrote us.
[P363] The same they begged off for tomorrow.
[P364] Then he's talking about a review he read of this dumpling place that he really wants to go to, that we could do that together.
[P365] And then then they're bringing in a third couple that the people who introduced us to them, who also we can't make plans.
[P366] You're also very bad at making plans.
[P367] I mean, the summary here, the summary here.
[P368] No, but I got to know.
[P369] So where does it, so where does it get?
[P370] Okay.
[P371] So then Jason's like, so then Jason's like, we are totally down for dumplings.
[P372] Yeah.
[P373] Okay.
[P374] So that was, I even included a dumpling emoji.
[P375] I mean, I'm really going for it here.
[P376] Okay.
[P377] So then, so that was Friday, September 27th.
[P378] Then Wednesday, November 6th.
[P379] That is the next text.
[P380] That afternoon, I have run into the dad at school.
[P381] And then that evening, the dad writes and says, so Jen and I actually got to talk at school today at pickup and it was fortuitous.
[P382] We said maybe the 16th.
[P383] And I said, we were free.
[P384] Well, I'm a dipshit.
[P385] There's a reason we're free.
[P386] Jane isn't here that weekend.
[P387] In fact, she's leaving blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P388] Why is this so hard?
[P389] And then after that, we did not respond because –
[P390] I wouldn't respond to that.
[P391] But like, this is, this is like, I'm so pathetic.
[P392] I still really want to have them over for dinner.
[P393] That's okay.
[P394] But I, but just hearing that text chain, I also wouldn't have responded because I, they're flaking without, they're flaking and like teasing plans.
[P395] And I don't know.
[P396] I don't like it.
[P397] What's going on?
[P398] I wouldn't make, maybe they let's, maybe they don't want to hang out.
[P399] See,
[P400] If they didn't want to hang out, why offer that level of detail?
[P401] It's so much detail.
[P402] It's almost even more because you maybe you know how liars sometimes are like, oh, my God, like I had to go to the dentist.
[P403] I have this deep to like, you know, right, right, right.
[P404] Details.
[P405] Maybe that's maybe that's it.
[P406] Can I run a theory by you?
[P407] Yes.
[P408] My theory is that we need to acknowledge something I'm going to call the social competency index.
[P409] Social competency index, which I just made up, is that everybody falls on a scale from one to 10 on social competency.
[P410] And I'm just going to define social competency as the ability to clearly communicate about social plans and follow through on them.
[P411] And
[P412] I think that everybody naturally falls somewhere on this index, but there are probably two things happening.
[P413] Number one,
[P414] at certain times in your life, and I think that we are all in that time, like whatever your natural social competency index number is.
[P415] So let's say you are naturally a five.
[P416] So it's like, you know, sometimes you're pretty good.
[P417] Sometimes you're not.
[P418] Let's just say like at this time in our life, which I'm just going to define as this is a time in our life where we all just are like really busy because we're like creating something.
[P419] So maybe it's family, maybe it's work, but like whatever.
[P420] This is like the moment of just charging hard that
[P421] your social competency index score naturally drops by two to three points.
[P422] So if you were naturally a five, now you're like a two.
[P423] But you may not be aware of that.
[P424] And so that's the other thing.
[P425] So I think we are often interacting with people
[P426] who think that they're good at making plans and have some of the instincts from when they were better at making plans, when they were like maybe a six or a seven, and they just cannot recognize that at this time in their life, they're actually a four or a five.
[P427] I think they're just not into us.
[P428] That's more simple.
[P429] I want to tell you something.
[P430] I think you're onto something.
[P431] I don't think that this is where you want to go with your life or your career, but that's actually a really interesting thing because as per the reactions you got on social media and how common this is happening with you and how I'm over here having the same experience on both sides.
[P432] Yeah.
[P433] But I'm just telling you, like, fine, I'm going to read my live text, which is.
[P434] Oh, yeah.
[P435] Katie, I think I saw you're in Palm Beach.
[P436] We have an hour break between ceremony and wedding tonight at Everglades and grabbing a beverage with blank at the colony at 430 in case you're around for a quick hang hug.
[P437] Now it's two o'clock when I've received this information.
[P438] And like, this seems like a really easy social drop in.
[P439] But I said, cute.
[P440] I'll let you know if I'm going to be around.
[P441] Because, again, I couldn't commit.
[P442] I'm going to say, though, that this falls into a different category.
[P443] Which one?
[P444] You get a request to hang out in a very short period of time from when the request comes in.
[P445] To me, that's a different situation.
[P446] Yeah.
[P447] There, I totally feel you in terms of like, do I really want to do this?
[P448] Even if I, in theory, want to see this person, am I going to want to leave the house at the time to do it?
[P449] But it's in like an hour.
[P450] No, but that's what I'm saying.
[P451] For me personally, I distinguish between plans that are made in advance and plans that might come up last minute if it requires me going somewhere.
[P452] Yeah.
[P453] So like if it was a question of like having people over or going somewhere like really close by, I don't care how last minute the plans are.
[P454] But in the middle of the day when like I'm already doing X, Y, and Z thing and somebody appears from out of town and requires me to go downtown to a hotel.
[P455] Yeah.
[P456] To me, that's a different situation than trying to make plans for dinner weeks in advance because you have the ability to then prepare yourself for
[P457] to psychologically prepare yourself to have that social engagement.
[P458] This is how it is for me.
[P459] I think I'm the opposite, Jen.
[P460] I think I am probably more likely to say yes to this, and I will most likely go to this because it just popped up on my radar.
[P461] I don't have to think about it for the next three days.
[P462] I don't have to have that whole cycle.
[P463] I can just be like, okay, this is happening.
[P464] Right now it's over.
[P465] By 5 p.m., this plan will be over anyway.
[P466] Oh, interesting.
[P467] Yeah.
[P468] So I will probably say yes to this.
[P469] We got a lot of problems here in our brains.
[P470] Yeah.
[P471] Well, I just think it's really interesting like how we're both kind of navigating the social anxiety and we have like different needs for calibrating it, right?
[P472] I need to prepare myself.
[P473] So like I would prefer to have the time.
[P474] Yeah, but I don't want the time.
[P475] And you don't want the time.
[P476] But the other thing though is that I keep – I mean I was joking before about he's just not that into you, but –
[P477] I mean, you know, occasionally someone will ask me to do something and I won't want to do it.
[P478] And I'll feel bad and I'll, but like it almost never happens because I'm usually really excited when somebody wants to do something.
[P479] I know.
[P480] I feel the same way.
[P481] It like, it might not be a priority because if there's other things going on and if it was like someone like I really, really wanted to see, but making that time, I don't actually have a lot of time to make that time.
[P482] I would only give that time up for someone who's a major, major priority.
[P483] Yeah.
[P484] Whereas if I had more flexibility, I'd be more in for just a casual hang.
[P485] But the reason I'm inclined to think that all these people don't actually want to hang out with us is because when I don't want to hang out with somebody, I just...
[P486] Don't don't.
[P487] I don't know.
[P488] I don't agree with I don't agree that they don't want to hang out, especially because that dad's coming in with I don't know that dad, that dad throwing that date out and then pulling it back.
[P489] So so, Jason, do you remember the other consideration that I had about why these plans might be canceled?
[P490] I would love Katie's take on this.
[P491] Do you remember?
[P492] No, remind me.
[P493] So because when you're dealing with couples, you have to deal with each person's issue.
[P494] And perhaps one member of the duo is uncomfortable and or doesn't want to hang out with us.
[P495] And the other person does.
[P496] Yes, that's real.
[P497] That's real, too.
[P498] Right.
[P499] And that's a really hard thing to untangle because this, we have been on, I don't know if we've been on one end of it or not, but we've certainly been on the other, which is that you and I have...
[P500] I enjoyed getting together with one person from another couple, but then the other person's dragging it down.
[P501] And then I'll be like, oh, yeah, we should get together with those people again.
[P502] And he'll be like, I don't know.
[P503] And then I can't throw my wife under the bus and be like, well, we can't get together because my wife doesn't like your wife.
[P504] So instead, I just have to become noncommittal.
[P505] I have to cover for her in some way.
[P506] And then nobody ever understands.
[P507] Yeah.
[P508] You may be onto something there.
[P509] I don't know about you, Jen, but like I frequently, when I get put with a, this is so stereotypical, but like when I get put with a wife that I don't get along with, we have nothing to say to each other.
[P510] And I know I'm going to be there just pulling teeth.
[P511] I can't force myself to do it.
[P512] And as I've gotten older, I actually won't do it.
[P513] So I'm just like, you know what?
[P514] You can go on fucking vacation with this family.
[P515] I don't care.
[P516] I'm not coming.
[P517] That's okay.
[P518] Because I feel like you should be able to nurture the friendship with the husband.
[P519] And it shouldn't have to be couple dependent.
[P520] I feel passionate about that.
[P521] Yeah.
[P522] Well, the problem for us, and I have a real thing about this.
[P523] This is like another episode perhaps for Help Wanted, but it's the problem of two couples getting together and the inevitable situation of the wives having to talk and the husbands having to talk.
[P524] And I hate that so much.
[P525] I hate it.
[P526] I want everyone to be able to talk together.
[P527] But the fact that it often defaults, and it's not that sometimes the wife is more interesting than the husband, and then that's great.
[P528] But often one person, often, I don't know.
[P529] I don't know what it is.
[P530] There's a dud in the bunch.
[P531] Yeah.
[P532] Yeah, there's a dud in the bunch.
[P533] So we had an interesting experience, which I don't know how to replicate, but Jen and I have talked about
[P534] if it's possible to engineer this, which is, so our friends, and they listen to this show, so I'm gonna call them out by name because it's a positive thing, which is, so during COVID, we met this couple, Kelly and Peter.
[P535] Kelly and Peter have this nice, large backyard.
[P536] And we didn't know them before.
[P537] And we would go over and our parents would watch our kids.
[P538] And then we would sit 10 feet apart.
[P539] And then we would talk.
[P540] And because we were 10 feet apart, there was no way for the conversation to split up into the guys talking and the women talking.
[P541] So it had to be a group.
[P542] because we were too far away for it to split.
[P543] And as a result, we created a fantastic foursome dynamic where everyone was contributing equally.
[P544] We were like, I get along with Kelly and with Peter, and Jen gets along with Kelly and with Peter.
[P545] And that created a really wonderful friendship.
[P546] And
[P547] And now COVID's gone and you don't have to sit 10 feet apart, which means that it's pretty easy to sit at a table and then have the conversation just cleave.
[P548] And the question is, how do you avoid the cleaving of the conversation?
[P549] I openly am like, no, no, no side convo.
[P550] I do that all the time at Group Generous.
[P551] You just police it.
[P552] Yeah.
[P553] Because I mean, probably everyone hates me, but I don't want to be in this one-on-one when I hear other shit happening across the table.
[P554] That's really interesting.
[P555] Yeah.
[P556] Yeah.
[P557] Wait, I want the game plan on that.
[P558] Are you literally just saying no side convo?
[P559] And who are you saying it to?
[P560] The whole group?
[P561] The whole group.
[P562] I'm like, no, no, no side convo.
[P563] Stop.
[P564] Because it happens so fast and then suddenly you're just there and 30 minutes later you look up and you're like, I don't know how we started talking about this and I don't even want to be.
[P565] So yes, no side convo is important.
[P566] All right, Jason, we're going to start implementing that.
[P567] No side combo.
[P568] We're going to put it on a t-shirt.
[P569] Yeah, no side combo.
[P570] That's really good.
[P571] It's like group chats only or like, I don't know.
[P572] I want a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P573] I will make you a t-shirt that says no side combo.
[P574] Okay.
[P575] But wait, what if I, but then can I just say what is triggering to me about this whole thing?
[P576] Which is that I am then convinced that the reason that the couples don't want to come over is because of me.
[P577] Because of course they want to talk.
[P578] Yeah, of course they want to talk to Jason.
[P579] No, no, no.
[P580] No, I understand.
[P581] I understand that.
[P582] Listen, five girls came in town earlier this week and they all saw me.
[P583] They all know I'm here.
[P584] They were all like, come hang out tomorrow.
[P585] No one called me and I wasn't going to call them.
[P586] So I am ready for rejection at every...
[P587] At every point, Jen.
[P588] So I understand how you feel.
[P589] How could you possibly be?
[P590] The second you came on this podcast, I was like, well, Katie's fun.
[P591] I am so fun.
[P592] But there's so many other factors, unfortunately, than fun in the social world.
[P593] And I don't always like that game.
[P594] We live in New York.
[P595] I mean, I'm live from Palm Beach, Florida right now.
[P596] But usually.
[P597] Yeah.
[P598] But like and there's a lot of there's a lot of unfortunate like social things that happen.
[P599] It's what are the what are the couples do for work?
[P600] Like who who can gain from who?
[P601] Like there's lots of shitty parts of like socializing that shouldn't be factors.
[P602] But I fear are factors for many people.
[P603] Just to leave it on a downer.
[P604] Yeah, no, well, I was going to say, yeah, so I'm going to bring it back up to end this.
[P605] So in conclusion, Jen, after hearing Katie, do you feel at least marginally better that people are not just avoiding you, that sometimes they just are bad at making plans?
[P606] I don't know, that dumpling daddy has me in question.
[P607] Jen, I want an answer.
[P608] I mean, I suppose that having a window into the social anxiety stuff that's happening and knowing that I have my own social anxiety.
[P609] And so I really can be empathetic to what might... I mean, honestly, I feel like if I had been more popular in middle school, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[P610] That is going to have to be for another podcast episode.
[P611] Yeah.
[P612] Katie, do you, have we resolved anything for you or are you just continuing to carry?
[P613] I think you've confirmed I'm like a social freak with like a, with like a two on that social scale.
[P614] Well, the thing is that it doesn't sound like you're a social freak.
[P615] It sounds like you, you are part of a very large tribe, which, you know, at the very least, now we all understand each other.
[P616] All right.
[P617] Final question, Katie.
[P618] Will you come over for dinner?
[P619] Do you want to hang out?
[P620] Yes.
[P621] Yes.
[P622] I was just thinking, I'm like, you know what?
[P623] John and I should hang out with you guys.
[P624] When we're back in the city, we would love to hang out.
[P625] Amazing.
[P626] All right.
[P627] We're going to make it happen.
[P628] And that is not bullshit.
[P629] We are going to make it happen.
[P630] Great.
[P631] Great.
[P632] And I feel good about that.
[P633] That feels easy for me.
[P634] FYI.
[P635] Oh, good.
[P636] Good.
[P637] That is a high compliment.
[P638] Okay.
[P639] I'm excited.
[P640] All right.

分析结果：
在这段对话中，我们可以看到几个关键问题围绕着社交计划的制定和执行展开。让我们通过休谟的怀疑之锥来解构这些问题：

1. **社交焦虑与计划制定**：
   - 对话中提到的社交焦虑如何影响人们制定和确认计划？
   - 这种焦虑是否普遍存在，还是特定于某些个体？

2. **社交能力指数**：
   - 提出的“社交能力指数”是否是一个有效的衡量标准？
   - 这个指数如何量化个人的社交能力，特别是在不同生活阶段的变化？

3. **计划制定的复杂性**：
   - 为什么有些人即使有意愿，也难以制定和确认社交计划？
   - 这种复杂性是否与个人的生活方式、工作压力或其他外部因素有关？

4. **社交互动的动态**：
   - 在社交互动中，如何平衡个人的舒适度与他人的期望？
   - 这种平衡如何影响长期的社交关系和计划制定？

5. **社交计划的执行**：
   - 为什么有些人在制定计划后难以执行，即使他们最初表现出兴趣？
   - 这种执行困难是否与个人的内在动机或外部压力有关？

通过这些问题，我们可以更深入地理解社交计划制定和执行中的复杂性，以及如何通过更好的沟通和理解来改善这些互动。

[P181] And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] You've done lots of training.
[P187] I've coached you.
[P188] We've trained together.

[P219] As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.

[P507] I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] And every so often...
[P514] They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] Sure.

分析结果：
从这些对话片段中，我们可以通过“系统思维”和“简化思维”的角度来简化信息：

1. **压力与紧迫感**：无论是个人还是公司，面对新挑战和未完成的任务时，都会感到压力和紧迫感。这是正常的，每个人都会经历。

2. **行动与授权**：关键在于开始行动，并且学会授权。即使是最高的管理者，有时也需要暂时放下管理者的角色，亲自参与到关键任务中，以确保公司能够顺利完成任务。

3. **系统与流程**：随着公司的发展，需要不断建立和完善新的系统和流程。这需要团队的协作和明确的分工，确保每个任务都有专人负责。

通过这些简化的视角，我们可以看到，无论是个人还是组织，面对压力和挑战时，关键在于开始行动、合理授权，并不断完善系统和流程。

主题：我用3分钟视频取代了500页员工手册：数字化时代SOP新革命 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P549] it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] So I got to do the thing.

[P573] We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] The thing is done, right?
[P576] Or 90% done, right?
[P577] So you're watching the video.
[P578] you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] It works incredibly well.
[P581] So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

[P622] One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] And I just go approve.
[P631] And now it's in the document.
[P632] And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.

### 独特视角：**将压力转化为知识资产**

在面对紧急任务时，大多数人会专注于快速解决问题，而忽略了将这个过程转化为可复用的知识。然而，你的做法恰恰相反：你在高压下依然有条不紊地记录解决问题的过程，这实际上是将压力转化为知识资产的过程。以下是从这个视角切入的解决步骤：

1. **实时记录**：在解决问题的同时，通过Loom视频记录屏幕和口述步骤。这不仅不会显著减慢速度，反而为后续的知识沉淀打下基础。
2. **转录与AI辅助**：将视频转录成文字，利用AI生成初步的标准化操作流程（SOP）。这一步将你的实时思考转化为结构化的文档。
3. **审核与优化**：仔细审阅AI生成的SOP，确保没有遗漏步骤，并优化表达清晰度。这一步将粗糙的流程转化为可执行的指南。
4. **协作与迭代**：将SOP交给团队成员执行，鼓励他们在执行过程中提出改进建议。通过Google Docs等工具，实时记录和审核这些建议，形成动态更新的SOP。
5. **信任与授权**：建立一种文化，让团队成员不仅执行SOP，还能主动拥有和优化它。这种信任和授权机制，确保了知识的持续迭代和团队能力的提升。

通过这种视角，你不仅解决了当下的问题，还将每一次紧急任务转化为团队的知识资产，为未来的效率提升和问题解决提供了坚实的基础。

输入内容：
[P43] A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] That's their game plan.
[P50] That's exactly right.
[P51] That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] They're marking on it.
[P53] They're writing on it.
[P54] They go back to halftime.
[P55] They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.

[P229] And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] to how you convert them.
[P232] And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.

[P397] That's right.
[P398] Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] We're going to step in as you.
[P403] We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] Nobody does this.
[P407] And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.

分析结果：
从客户体验的视角来看，整个流程可以简化为一个“体验漏斗”。想象一下，客户从第一次听说你，到最终成为忠实用户，就像水流过一个漏斗。关键在于确保这个漏斗的每一层都尽可能顺畅无阻。

1. **顶层：认知** - 客户第一次接触到你，可能是通过播客、YouTube视频等。这一层的关键是吸引注意力，就像IKEA的说明书封面要足够吸引人，让人愿意打开盒子。

2. **中层：转化** - 客户从潜在用户转化为实际用户。这一层就像IKEA的说明书中的步骤，需要清晰易懂。有的客户可能一步到位，有的可能需要多次沟通，就像教练在比赛中的战术板，需要根据实际情况调整。

3. **底层：忠诚** - 客户成为忠实用户，持续使用你的产品或服务。这一层就像IKEA家具的最终组装，需要确保每一步都稳固可靠。如果出现问题，就像客户反馈某个部分不好用，你需要迅速介入，手动解决问题，并最终自动化或永久解决这个问题。

通过这种“体验漏斗”的视角，你可以清晰地看到每个环节的关键点，并确保每个环节都尽可能顺畅，从而提升整体客户体验。

[P91] Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] And that's true for a time.
[P94] But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.

[P114] at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**从“超级英雄”到“系统架构师”的转变**

1. **超级英雄阶段**  
   - 创始人初期往往认为自己无所不能，事必躬亲。这种“超级英雄”心态在初期确实能推动业务发展，但随着规模扩大，这种模式会迅速成为瓶颈。  
   - **问题本质**：创始人试图用个人能力替代系统，导致效率低下和精力耗尽。

2. **系统觉醒时刻**  
   - 当创始人开始错过会议、成为流程瓶颈，或感到“被淹没”时，正是意识到需要系统的关键时刻。  
   - **问题本质**：个人能力无法规模化，必须用系统替代个人。

3. **信任与授权**  
   - 创始人需要从“只信任自己”转变为信任团队。这包括：  
     - 建立标准化流程（SOP）  
     - 培训团队执行这些流程  
     - 将责任逐步转移给团队  
   - **问题本质**：信任是系统化的前提，授权是规模化的基础。

4. **从“做”到“建”**  
   - 创始人的角色应从“执行者”转变为“系统架构师”，专注于设计和优化系统，而不是亲自完成每一项任务。  
   - **问题本质**：创始人最大的价值在于构建可持续的系统，而非成为系统的核心。

### 解决步骤：
1. **识别瓶颈**  
   - 找出哪些任务正在消耗你的时间和精力，并成为业务的瓶颈。

2. **建立SOP**  
   - 将这些任务标准化，写成清晰的流程文档。

3. **培训团队**  
   - 选择合适的人选，培训他们执行这些流程，并给予试错空间。

4. **逐步授权**  
   - 将责任转移给团队，定期检查结果，但避免微观管理。

5. **优化系统**  
   - 持续改进流程，确保系统高效运转，解放创始人的时间和精力。

6. **角色升级**  
   - 将注意力转向战略规划、资源整合和系统创新，推动业务进入下一阶段。

### 一句话总结：  
创始人最大的挑战不是“做更多”，而是“建系统”，从“超级英雄”升级为“系统架构师”，让业务脱离个人依赖，实现可持续增长。

[P181] And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] You've done lots of training.
[P187] I've coached you.
[P188] We've trained together.

[P219] As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.

[P507] I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] And every so often...
[P514] They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] Sure.

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段话中呈现的核心矛盾是：领导者身份与执行者身份之间的张力。从演化角度看，这种双重身份源于组织发展的不同阶段：初创期需要全能型人才，成熟期则需要专业化分工。存在主义视角下，这种角色转换反映了人的本质是"可能性"——领导者既是决策者，也是执行者。通过现象学还原，我们褪去"CEO"和"执行者"的表象，发现其本质是"问题解决者"。属和种差定义：领导者是能够在不同层面解决组织问题的决策者和执行者。

主题：警惕！你花百万打造的SOP正在杀死创造力 - perspectives

输入内容：
[P68] What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.

[P406] Nobody does this.
[P407] And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] It sounds like their job, right?

[P458] Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] Yes.
[P460] These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.

分析结果：
### 独特视角：**“SOP进化论”**

想象一下，SOP（标准操作流程）就像是一个生物体，它需要不断进化以适应环境的变化。以下是从这个视角切入的简化解决步骤：

1. **基因编码（初始SOP）**
   - **任务**：从最简单的任务开始，编写初始SOP。
   - **类比**：就像生物体的基因编码，初始SOP是基础，但并非一成不变。

2. **自然选择（持续优化）**
   - **任务**：定期审视SOP，根据客户需求和技术变化进行微调。
   - **类比**：自然选择筛选出最适应环境的基因，SOP也需要通过小步迭代来优化。

3. **物种分化（SOP多样化）**
   - **任务**：根据不同业务场景，创建多个SOP变体。
   - **类比**：物种分化适应不同生态环境，SOP也需要多样化以适应不同业务需求。

4. **共生关系（团队协作）**
   - **任务**：确保团队成员理解并认同SOP，培养“主人翁”心态。
   - **类比**：共生关系促进物种共同进化，团队协作推动SOP的持续改进。

5. **进化加速（技术赋能）**
   - **任务**：利用技术工具加速SOP的更新和传播。
   - **类比**：技术就像基因工程，可以加速生物进化，技术工具也能加速SOP的优化和落地。

### 关键洞察：
- **SOP是活的**：它不是一成不变的文件，而是需要不断进化的系统。
- **小步快跑**：每次只做5%的调整，比一次性大改更有效。
- **团队共识**：SOP的成功依赖于团队的认同和执行。

通过这个“SOP进化论”的视角，你可以更轻松地理解和实施SOP的创建和优化，从而提升业务效率和客户满意度。

[P550] Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] So I got to do the thing.

[P573] We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] The thing is done, right?
[P576] Or 90% done, right?
[P577] So you're watching the video.
[P578] you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] It works incredibly well.
[P581] So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

[P622] One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] And I just go approve.
[P631] And now it's in the document.
[P632] And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.

[P45] And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] That's their game plan.
[P50] That's exactly right.
[P51] That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] They're marking on it.
[P53] They're writing on it.
[P54] They go back to halftime.
[P55] They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.

[P229] And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] to how you convert them.
[P232] And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.

[P397] That's right.
[P398] Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] We're going to step in as you.
[P403] We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] Nobody does this.
[P407] And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.

输入内容：
[P549] it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] So I got to do the thing.

[P573] We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] The thing is done, right?
[P576] Or 90% done, right?
[P577] So you're watching the video.
[P578] you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] It works incredibly well.
[P581] So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

[P622] One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] And I just go approve.
[P631] And now it's in the document.
[P632] And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.

分析结果：
### 演化分析
从口头传授到书面记录，再到数字化文档，最终实现智能化处理，SOP（标准操作程序）的演进反映了人类知识传递方式的不断优化。不变的内核是：确保操作的一致性和可重复性。

### 矛盾分析
主要矛盾在于：标准化与灵活性之间的张力。一方面，SOP需要严格遵循以确保一致性；另一方面，实际操作中可能需要根据具体情况调整步骤。

### 存在理由
SOP存在的根本原因在于：降低知识传递成本，提高操作效率，减少人为错误。它使得经验可以系统化、可复制化，从而实现知识的积累和传承。

### 本质还原
褪去技术手段的表象，SOP的本质是一种知识管理的工具。它通过将隐性知识显性化，将个人经验转化为组织资产，实现知识的共享和传承。

### 属和种差
属：知识管理工具
种差：通过标准化步骤和流程，将个人经验转化为可复制、可验证的操作指南，以实现操作的一致性和效率提升。

SOP的本质是一种将个人经验转化为标准化操作流程的知识管理工具，旨在实现操作的一致性和效率提升，同时平衡标准化与灵活性的需求。

输入内容：
[P91] Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] And that's true for a time.
[P94] But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.

[P114] at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think

[P272] At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] Right.
[P274] And it's yours.
[P275] That's right.
[P276] Right.
[P277] And so over time, that changes.
[P278] Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考。这段话揭示了创业者从个人英雄主义到系统化管理的本质转变过程。

从演化分析来看，创业者的角色经历了从"全能执行者"到"系统构建者"的转变。这种转变源于企业规模扩大带来的必然需求。

主要矛盾在于创业者个人能力与企业成长需求之间的矛盾。创业者最初相信自己的能力，但随着企业发展，这种个人英雄主义反而成为瓶颈。

从存在主义视角看，创业者必须认识到：真正的存在价值不在于亲力亲为，而在于构建可持续的系统。这是创业者角色存在的根本理由。

通过现象学还原，我们可以看到本质：创业者的核心任务不是执行，而是建立可复制的系统，培养可信任的团队。这才是企业持续发展的根本。

属和种差定义：创业者（属）是从个人执行者向系统构建者转变的企业创始人（种差）。

主题：警惕！你花百万打造的SOP正在杀死创造力 - thought_provoking

输入内容：
[P68] What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.

[P406] Nobody does this.
[P407] And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] It sounds like their job, right?

[P458] Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] Yes.
[P460] These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.

分析结果：
### 核心变量提取
1. **系统化 ≈ 可重复性 + 效率**
2. **创始人魔法 ≈ 独特贡献 - 系统化**
3. **SOP（标准操作程序） ≈ 系统化 + 可管理性**
4. **判断力 ≈ 系统化 * 情境理解**
5. **SOP迭代 ≈ 系统化 + 持续改进**

### 逻辑链条构建
1. **系统化 vs. 创始人魔法**
   - 创始人认为其贡献无法系统化（创始人魔法 ≈ 独特贡献 - 系统化）
   - 现实：部分任务可系统化，部分需情境判断（系统化 ≈ 可重复性 + 效率）

2. **SOP的建立与迭代**
   - 从简单任务开始建立SOP（SOP ≈ 系统化 + 可管理性）
   - SOP需持续改进，适应变化（SOP迭代 ≈ 系统化 + 持续改进）

3. **判断力的重要性**
   - 系统化需结合判断力（判断力 ≈ 系统化 * 情境理解）
   - 低层员工难以理解客户视角（判断力 ≈ 系统化 * 情境理解）

4. **SOP的灵活性**
   - SOP是动态的，需小步迭代（SOP迭代 ≈ 系统化 + 持续改进）
   - 小幅度调整比大幅改变更易实施（SOP迭代 ≈ 系统化 + 持续改进）

### 知识精髓提炼
**系统化 ≈ 可重复性 + 效率**  
**SOP ≈ 系统化 + 可管理性 + 持续改进**  
**判断力 ≈ 系统化 * 情境理解**  

系统化并非否定创始人的独特贡献，而是通过SOP实现效率与可重复性，同时结合判断力适应情境变化。SOP需动态迭代，小步改进，逐步优化，最终实现高效管理与持续发展。

分析结果：
让我们从最基本处开始思考系统的本质。表象之下，系统究竟是什么？

从演化分析来看，系统源于人类对复杂性的应对需求。从原始社会的分工协作，到现代企业的流程化管理，系统始终在解决"如何有效组织复杂事物"这一核心问题。

矛盾分析法揭示，系统存在的主要矛盾是"标准化与灵活性"的对立。一方面需要明确的步骤和规范，另一方面又要适应具体情境的变化。这种矛盾推动着系统的持续优化。

从存在主义视角，系统的存在理由在于它为人类活动提供了可预测性和可控性。没有系统，复杂的任务将陷入混乱。系统的存在使人类能够处理远超个体能力的复杂事务。

通过现象学还原，褪去具体形式，系统的本质是"将复杂过程分解为可管理的步骤，并建立各步骤间的逻辑关系"。无论是宜家家具的组装说明，还是橄榄球教练的比赛计划，都体现了这一本质。

属和种差定义：系统是（属）一种将复杂过程分解为可管理步骤，并建立步骤间逻辑关系的（种差）组织方式。它既需要明确的规范，又保持必要的灵活性，其存在使人类能够有效处理复杂事务。

这就是系统的本质。

[P622] One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] And I just go approve.
[P631] And now it's in the document.
[P632] And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.

分析结果：
这就像在厨房里做一道复杂的菜。你一边做，一边对着摄像机讲解每个步骤，就像在教一个学徒。即使时间紧迫，你也不会因此手忙脚乱，因为讲解的过程本就是你在脑海中梳理步骤的自然延伸。

录制完视频后，你可以把解说词转录成文字，交给AI助手，让它帮你整理出一份标准化的菜谱。你只需稍作润色，确保没有遗漏任何细节，一份清晰的烹饪指南就诞生了。

当学徒第一次按照这份菜谱做菜时，你要求他们严格遵循每一个步骤。但如果他们发现某些步骤需要调整，可以在菜谱上添加注释。你会在第二天查看这些建议，如果合理就予以采纳，让菜谱不断完善。

这整个过程的关键在于信任。你不仅要把做菜的技艺传授给学徒，还要让他们感受到你对他们的信任，从而真正拥有这份菜谱，成为厨房的主人。就像一位大厨，不仅要教会徒弟如何烹饪，更要培养他们对烹饪的热爱和责任感。

[P183] I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] You've done lots of training.
[P187] I've coached you.
[P188] We've trained together.

[P219] As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.

[P507] I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] And every so often...
[P514] They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] Sure.

分析结果：
在这个快节奏、高压力的世界里，我们似乎总是在追赶时间，试图在有限的资源中完成无限的任务。从个人到企业，从基层员工到CEO，每个人都在与时间赛跑，试图在紧迫的节奏中找到平衡。然而，这种“紧迫感”真的能带来我们想要的结果吗？还是说，它只是我们逃避更深层次问题的借口？

**现状分析**  
我们生活在一个“多任务处理”被视为美德的时代。无论是个人还是企业，都在不断地增加任务清单，仿佛完成更多的任务就意味着更大的成功。但事实是，我们往往在忙碌中迷失了方向，错过了真正重要的东西。比如，你提到的“错过会议”和“需要移交工作”，这些都是表面现象，背后隐藏的是我们对任务优先级的误判和对时间管理的失控。

**个体剖析**  
当你说“给自己一些宽容”时，我看到的是一种对自我要求的妥协。我们总是用“忙碌”来证明自己的价值，却忽略了真正的价值在于我们做了什么，而不是我们做了多少。你提到的CEO们脱下“CEO帽子”去执行具体任务，这看似是一种责任感的体现，但实际上，这是否意味着他们在逃避更高层次的战略思考？或者说，他们是否真的能够同时兼顾战略与执行？

**群体透视**  
从企业的角度来看，系统的缺失和任务的堆积，反映的是组织内部的混乱和对未来的不确定性。你提到的“2025年的新系统”和“需要编写的流程”，这些不仅仅是一个技术问题，更是一个管理问题。企业如何在快速发展的同时，保持内部的一致性和稳定性？这是一个值得深思的问题。而CEO们频繁地介入具体任务，是否意味着他们在某种程度上放弃了领导者的角色，转而成为了“超级员工”？

**思考整合**  
我们生活在一个充满不确定性的时代，紧迫感和压力无处不在。然而，真正的挑战并不在于我们如何应对这些压力，而在于我们如何在压力中找到自己的方向。无论是个人还是企业，都需要重新审视自己的优先级，明确什么是真正重要的，而不是被表面的忙碌所迷惑。给自己一些宽容，并不意味着放弃责任，而是为了更好地承担责任。我们需要学会在忙碌中找到平衡，在压力中找到方向，这才是我们真正需要思考的问题。

所以，当你感到压力山大时，不妨停下来，问问自己：我到底在追求什么？是更多的任务，还是更好的结果？是表面的忙碌，还是真正的价值？答案或许就在你的内心深处，只是你还没有时间去倾听。

主题：警惕！你花百万打造的SOP正在杀死创造力 - essence

输入内容：
[P68] What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.

[P406] Nobody does this.
[P407] And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] It sounds like their job, right?

[P458] Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] Yes.
[P460] These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.

分析结果：
从本质上看，标准操作程序（SOP）的建立与演化体现了人类认知与实践的辩证发展过程。让我们通过现象学还原法来剖析其本质：

1. 演化分析
SOP起源于人类对重复性工作的系统化需求，其内核是将经验转化为可复制的操作流程。这一过程反映了人类从感性认识到理性认识的飞跃。

2. 矛盾分析
SOP的核心矛盾在于标准化与灵活性的对立统一。一方面需要固定流程以确保效率，另一方面又要适应环境变化而不断调整。这种矛盾推动了SOP的持续进化。

3. 存在理由
SOP存在的根本原因是人类认知的有限性与实践需求的无限性之间的矛盾。通过将经验系统化，SOP实现了知识的传承与效率的提升。

4. 本质还原
SOP的本质是一种动态的知识管理系统，其核心功能是将隐性知识显性化，将个人经验组织化，从而实现知识的积累与优化。

5. 属和种差
SOP属于组织管理工具的一种，其种差在于其系统化、标准化和动态化的特征。它不同于一般的操作指南，而是强调流程的完整性和可迭代性。

因此，SOP的本质是一种动态的知识管理系统，其核心功能是将隐性知识显性化，将个人经验组织化，从而实现知识的积累与优化。这一过程体现了人类认知与实践的辩证发展，是组织效率提升和知识传承的重要工具。

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来解构这段对话：

1. **澄清定义**
   - "压力"和"紧迫感"的具体表现是什么？如何量化？
   - "系统"和"流程"的确切含义是什么？它们如何相互作用？

2. **概念溯源**
   - 这种压力感是普遍存在的吗？是否有数据支持？
   - CEO兼任技术角色的现象是如何产生的？历史上有哪些典型案例？

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设1：压力必然导致效率下降。这个假设是否成立？
   - 假设2：CEO兼任技术角色是必要的。是否有替代方案？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 压力是否可能激发创造力？
   - CEO兼任技术角色的利弊如何权衡？

5. **刷新表述**
   - 压力管理的关键在于认知重构，而非单纯的任务分配。
   - 组织架构的灵活性应该建立在明确的职责划分基础上，而非角色混淆。

最终结论：真正的领导力不在于事必躬亲，而在于建立高效的系统，让每个人都能在合适的岗位上发挥最大价值。压力管理应该从系统优化入手，而非依赖个人的多任务处理能力。

主题：从宜家说明书到超级碗战术板：顶级企业绝不外传的SOP设计心法 - analogy

输入内容：
[P43] A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] That's their game plan.
[P50] That's exactly right.
[P51] That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] They're marking on it.
[P53] They're writing on it.
[P54] They go back to halftime.
[P55] They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.

[P229] And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] to how you convert them.
[P232] And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.

[P397] That's right.
[P398] Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] We're going to step in as you.
[P403] We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] Nobody does this.
[P407] And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.

分析结果：
就像一位厨师在厨房里，不仅要照着食谱一步步做菜，还要随时品尝、调整味道，直到端出一道完美的佳肴。系统化流程就像那本食谱，指导着每一步操作，但真正的艺术在于根据实际情况灵活调整，就像厨师根据食材的新鲜度和客人的口味偏好来微调配方。

在商业中，这就像一支足球队的战术板，教练在赛前精心设计每一套战术，但在比赛中，他们必须根据对手的变化和场上的局势不断调整策略。客户生命周期管理也是如此，从第一次接触到最终转化，再到后续服务，每一步都需要像教练一样，根据客户的需求和反馈，灵活调整策略，确保整个过程顺畅无阻。

而当涉及到B2B业务时，这就像一场接力赛，你的服务或产品不仅要满足直接客户的需求，还要帮助他们更好地服务他们的客户。这就像接力棒在队员之间传递，每一棒都必须精准无误，才能确保最终胜利。

最后，当客户遇到问题时，像一位贴心的管家一样，主动承担起解决问题的责任，不仅展示了卓越的客户服务，还能深入理解客户的需求，从而不断优化自己的产品和服务。这就像管家不仅解决眼前的问题，还会预见未来的需求，提前做好准备，让客户感到无比安心和满意。

[P92] And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] And that's true for a time.
[P94] But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.

[P114] at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] It's when you start being the bottleneck.

[P273] Right.
[P274] And it's yours.

分析结果：
创业者的“超级英雄”情结，本质上是一种自我膨胀的幻觉。你觉得自己无所不能，能比所有人都做得更好，这种心态在初期或许能推动你前进，但很快，它就会变成你的枷锁。你开始淹没在日常琐事中，无法真正“经营”你的企业，而是被它“经营”。你成了那个永远在救火的人，永远在应付“紧急”事务的人，永远无法抽身的人。

这种“超级英雄”心态的背后，其实是一种控制欲的体现。你害怕放手，害怕失去对企业的掌控，害怕别人无法像你一样把事情做好。于是，你成了那个“瓶颈”，那个让整个系统停滞不前的人。你开始错过会议，开始无法跟上节奏，开始感受到一种无法摆脱的“混乱感”。你觉得自己在“溺水”，却不知道，正是你自己在制造这场“溺水”。

真正的创业者，必须学会信任别人。这不是一蹴而就的，而是一个渐进的过程。你需要建立系统，制定标准操作流程（SOP），然后把这些交给别人，让他们去执行。你需要培训他们，给他们时间适应，然后放手。这个过程需要时间，需要耐心，更需要勇气。你必须承认，你不是无所不能的，你也不是唯一能做好事情的人。

最初，你只信任自己的判断，这是人之常情。但随着时间的推移，你必须学会信任别人的判断。那些长期跟随你的员工，那些你精心挑选的高管，他们会成为你信任的对象。但要做到这一点，你必须先给自己足够的时间去建立这种信任。你必须先学会放手，学会接受“不完美”，学会接受“失控”。只有这样，你才能真正从“超级英雄”的幻觉中走出来，成为一个真正的创业者。

创业不是一场个人英雄主义的表演，而是一场团队合作的马拉松。你不需要成为那个无所不能的“超级英雄”，你需要成为那个懂得信任、懂得放手的领导者。这才是创业的真正意义。

主题：我用3分钟视频取代了500页员工手册：数字化时代SOP新革命 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P549] it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] So I got to do the thing.

[P573] We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] The thing is done, right?
[P576] Or 90% done, right?
[P577] So you're watching the video.
[P578] you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] It works incredibly well.
[P581] So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.

[P622] One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] And I just go approve.
[P631] And now it's in the document.
[P632] And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.

分析结果：
让我们深入思考一下这个场景：一个人在面对紧急任务时，仍然选择录制Loom视频，并最终通过AI生成标准操作程序（SOP）。这看似高效的做法，实际上揭示了现代工作文化中的几个深层次问题。

首先，这种“一边做一边录”的行为，表面上是为了提高效率，但实际上反映了一种“自我剥削”的工作态度。我们不禁要问：为什么在如此紧迫的情况下，还要额外负担录制和解释的任务？这难道不是对个人精力的过度消耗吗？这种“永远在线”的工作模式，是否正在悄然侵蚀我们的身心健康？

其次，依赖AI生成SOP的做法，看似聪明，实则暴露了我们对“标准化”的盲目崇拜。我们真的需要把每一个操作都标准化吗？这种过度标准化是否会扼杀员工的创造力和灵活性？当所有工作都被简化为可复制的步骤时，我们是否正在制造一个缺乏思考和判断力的“机器人”式工作环境？

再者，这种通过Google Doc进行SOP修改和审批的流程，表面上体现了信任和授权，但实际上可能只是一种“伪授权”。员工真的拥有对SOP的所有权吗？还是说，他们只是在执行一个预先设定好的框架？这种“允许修改”的表象下，是否隐藏着更深层次的权力控制？

最后，这种工作方式反映了一个更大的社会趋势：我们正在将人类的工作方式越来越接近机器。我们追求效率，追求标准化，追求可复制性，但在这个过程中，我们是否正在失去作为人类最宝贵的特质——创造力、灵活性和判断力？

在这个“效率至上”的时代，我们需要反思：我们追求的到底是什么？是真正的进步，还是只是对效率和标准化的盲目追求？我们是否正在创造一个更加人性化的工作环境，还是正在将自己变成高效但缺乏灵魂的“工作机器”？

主题：警惕！你花百万打造的SOP正在杀死创造力 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P68] What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.

[P406] Nobody does this.
[P407] And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] It sounds like their job, right?

[P458] Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] Yes.
[P460] These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.

分析结果：
### 现状分析
在这个快速变化的商业环境中，许多企业家和创始人对于将业务流程系统化、标准化持有怀疑态度。他们认为自己的独特“魔法”是成功的关键，不能被简单地归结为一份清单或标准操作程序（SOP）。然而，现实是，许多流程确实可以被系统化，只是我们尚未找到合适的方法或时机。

### 个体剖析
企业家们常常高估了自己的不可替代性，低估了系统化的潜力。他们可能出于对控制的渴望，或是对未知的恐惧，拒绝将业务流程标准化。然而，这种态度往往限制了企业的成长和效率。系统化并不意味着失去控制，而是为了更好地管理和优化流程。

### 群体透视
从更广泛的社会视角来看，系统化和标准化是工业革命以来的重要趋势。它们提高了效率，降低了成本，使得大规模生产和服务成为可能。然而，这也带来了对个体创造性和灵活性的压制。如何在系统化和个性化之间找到平衡，是现代企业面临的重要挑战。

### 思考整合
系统化和标准化并不是对企业家“魔法”的否定，而是对其的补充和延伸。通过建立灵活、可调整的SOP，企业可以在保持效率的同时，保留应对变化的能力。关键在于，这些SOP必须是“活”的，能够随着技术、市场和客户需求的变化而不断进化。只有这样，企业才能在激烈的竞争中保持领先地位。

**核心洞察：** 系统化和标准化不是对企业家独特“魔法”的威胁，而是其力量的延伸。通过建立灵活、可调整的SOP，企业可以在保持效率的同时，保留应对变化的能力，从而在竞争中保持领先。

主题：从宜家说明书到超级碗战术板：顶级企业绝不外传的SOP设计心法 - contemplator

输入内容：
[P43] A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] That's their game plan.
[P50] That's exactly right.
[P51] That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] They're marking on it.
[P53] They're writing on it.
[P54] They go back to halftime.
[P55] They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.

[P229] And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] to how you convert them.
[P232] And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.

[P397] That's right.
[P398] Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] We're going to step in as you.
[P403] We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] Nobody does this.
[P407] And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.

分析结果：
### 现状分析

在这个信息爆炸的时代，我们被各种系统和流程包围。从IKEA的家具组装说明书到橄榄球教练的战术板，再到企业客户生命周期的复杂映射，系统无处不在。它们被设计成尽可能简单易懂，但现实往往并非如此。我们被告知，只要按部就班，就能达到目标。然而，这些系统真的如表面所示那般简单吗？还是说，它们只是掩盖了更深层次的复杂性和矛盾？

### 个体剖析

让我们抛开这些系统的表象，深入挖掘其本质。IKEA的说明书看似简单，但背后隐藏的是对消费者耐心的考验和对标准化生产的执着。橄榄球教练的战术板，虽然只是一张纸，却承载着整个团队的胜负压力。而企业的客户生命周期，从营销到销售再到售后服务，每一个环节都充满了不确定性和挑战。这些系统表面上是为了简化流程，实际上却是对个体自由和创造力的束缚。我们被要求遵循这些规则，但在这个过程中，我们是否失去了独立思考的能力？

### 群体透视

从更广泛的社会视角来看，这些系统不仅仅是工具，它们还反映了现代社会的运行逻辑。我们生活在一个高度分工和标准化的世界中，每个人都被要求扮演特定的角色，遵循特定的流程。这种模式虽然提高了效率，但也带来了异化和疏离感。企业和客户之间的关系，不再是人与人之间的互动，而是系统与系统之间的对接。我们被数据和分析所驱动，失去了对真实需求和情感的关注。这种趋势在B2B领域尤为明显，复杂的客户生命周期映射，实际上是对商业利益最大化的追求，而非对客户体验的真正关怀。

### 思考整合

综合来看，这些系统和流程虽然表面上是为了简化生活和工作，但实际上它们掩盖了更深层次的问题。我们被要求遵循这些规则，但在这个过程中，我们是否失去了独立思考的能力？我们是否真正理解了客户的需求，还是仅仅在追求效率和利益的最大化？那些声称“站在客户角度”的企业，是否真的做到了，还是只是在利用这一点来提升自己的形象？

最终，我们需要反思的是，这些系统和流程是否真的服务于我们的需求，还是我们在不知不觉中被它们所控制？真正的创新和进步，或许不在于遵循既有的规则，而在于打破这些规则，重新思考我们与系统、与他人、与自己的关系。只有这样，我们才能真正站在客户的角度，理解他们的需求，提供真正有价值的服务。

主题：为什么越成功的CEO越不信任自己？从混乱到秩序的创业救赎 - doubt

输入内容：
[P91] Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] And that's true for a time.
[P94] But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.

[P114] at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think

[P272] At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] Right.
[P274] And it's yours.
[P275] That's right.
[P276] Right.
[P277] And so over time, that changes.
[P278] Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is

分析结果：
### 澄清定义
首先，我们需要明确几个关键概念：
1. **创始人心理**：指创始人在创业初期对企业的强烈归属感和控制欲。
2. **超级英雄心态**：创始人认为自己能够胜任所有工作，并且比其他人做得更好。
3. **系统化**：将工作流程标准化，以便他人能够执行。

### 概念溯源
创始人心理和超级英雄心态在创业初期是常见的现象。这种现象源于创始人对企业的深厚情感和对成功的渴望。然而，随着企业的发展，这种心态可能会成为瓶颈。

### 解构假设
1. **假设一**：创始人能够长期胜任所有工作。
   - **质疑**：随着企业规模扩大，创始人的时间和精力有限，无法持续高效地处理所有事务。
2. **假设二**：只有创始人才能做出最佳决策。
   - **质疑**：团队成员经过培训和系统化后，同样能够做出高质量的决策。

### 辩证分析
1. **创始人视角**：在创业初期，创始人的亲力亲为是必要的，因为他们对企业的愿景和细节有最深刻的理解。
2. **团队视角**：随着企业成长，团队成员的专业能力和经验积累，能够分担创始人的工作，提升整体效率。

### 刷新表述
1. **系统化的重要性**：创始人需要将工作流程系统化，编写标准操作程序（SOP），并培训团队成员，以确保工作的一致性和效率。
2. **信任与授权**：创始人需要逐步信任团队成员的判断力，授权他们执行任务，从而释放自己的时间和精力，专注于战略决策。
3. **时机选择**：系统化和授权的最佳时机是在企业现有系统开始出现瓶颈时，而不是等到完全陷入混乱。

### 建设性新观点
创始人应认识到，企业的成功不仅仅依赖于个人的能力，而是团队的协作和系统的支持。通过系统化和授权，创始人可以避免陷入日常事务的泥潭，专注于企业的长期发展和战略规划。这种转变不仅能够提升企业的运营效率，还能为创始人创造更多的时间和空间，实现个人和企业的共同成长。

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来解构这段关于SOP（标准操作程序）的讨论：

1. **澄清定义**
   - SOP的本质是什么？是固定不变的规则，还是动态优化的工具？
   - "信任"和"所有权"在SOP管理中的具体含义是什么？

2. **概念溯源**
   - SOP的起源是什么？它最初是为了解决什么问题？
   - 从工业革命到数字时代，SOP的演变过程是怎样的？

3. **解构假设**
   - 假设1：SOP必须100%遵循才能保证质量。这个假设成立吗？
   - 假设2：AI生成的SOP可以覆盖90%的需求。这个数字的依据是什么？
   - 假设3：员工参与SOP改进会提高执行效果。这个因果关系是否被验证过？

4. **辩证分析**
   - 正面：SOP确实可以提高效率，确保一致性，便于知识传承。
   - 反面：过度依赖SOP可能扼杀创新，降低员工主动性，难以应对特殊情况。
   - 综合：SOP应该是一个动态平衡的体系，既保持核心流程的稳定性，又允许持续优化和创新。

5. **刷新表述**
   - SOP的本质不是僵化的规则，而是知识传递和持续改进的工具。
   - 有效的SOP管理需要建立信任文化，赋予员工改进权，同时保持必要的审核机制。
   - AI可以辅助SOP的生成和优化，但人类的判断和创造力仍然是不可替代的。
   - 理想的SOP体系应该是：标准化+灵活性+持续改进+文化认同的有机结合。

这个分析揭示了SOP管理的深层逻辑：它不仅是操作指南，更是组织文化和知识管理的载体。真正的挑战不在于制定完美的SOP，而在于建立一个能够持续学习、适应和进化的体系。

[P467] That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.

分析结果：
让我们深入探讨这个关于SOP（标准操作程序）和系统构建的讨论。首先，我们需要澄清几个关键概念：

1. **SOP的本质**：SOP并非一成不变的规则，而是动态的指导框架。它应该随着环境变化而不断进化，但这种进化是渐进式的，而非革命性的。

2. **系统与个人能力的关系**：系统化并不意味着抹杀个人创造力。相反，它提供了一个基础框架，让个人能够在更高层次上发挥其独特价值。

3. **判断力的角色**：在构建和执行SOP时，判断力至关重要。这不仅适用于高层管理者，也需要在组织各个层面培养这种能力。

现在，让我们解构一些潜在的假设：

- **假设1**：所有流程都可以被系统化。
  质疑：某些高度依赖情境判断的任务可能难以完全系统化。

- **假设2**：系统化会降低工作价值。
  质疑：适当的系统化实际上可以释放人力资源，专注于更高价值的任务。

从辩证的角度看，我们需要平衡以下对立面：

1. **标准化 vs. 灵活性**：如何在确保一致性的同时保持适应能力？

2. **效率 vs. 创新**：系统化如何既能提高效率，又不扼杀创新？

3. **控制 vs. 授权**：如何在保持质量控制的同时，赋予员工更多自主权？

基于这些分析，我们可以得出以下结论：

1. **渐进式改进**：SOP的优化应该是持续的小幅调整，而非剧烈变革。

2. **以人为本的系统设计**：系统应该服务于人，而不是相反。它应该增强而非限制人的能力。

3. **培养系统思维**：在组织中培养理解、使用和改进系统的能力，这需要时间、培训和持续投入。

4. **客户中心性**：所有系统和流程的最终目标应该是更好地服务客户，这需要深入理解客户需求。

5. **持续学习**：将SOP视为学习工具，通过不断反思和改进来提升组织能力。

这些洞见表明，有效的系统化不是简单的规则制定，而是一个需要智慧、耐心和持续投入的复杂过程。它要求我们既要尊重流程的力量，也要珍视人的创造力，在两者之间找到恰当的平衡。

主题：从宜家说明书到超级碗战术板：顶级企业绝不外传的SOP设计心法 - doubt

输入内容：
[P43] A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] That's their game plan.
[P50] That's exactly right.
[P51] That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] They're marking on it.
[P53] They're writing on it.
[P54] They go back to halftime.
[P55] They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.

[P229] And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] to how you convert them.
[P232] And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.

[P397] That's right.
[P398] Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] We're going to step in as you.
[P403] We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] Nobody does this.
[P407] And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.

分析结果：
让我们用怀疑之锥来解构这个关于系统和客户生命周期的讨论：

1. **定义澄清**
   - "系统"在这里被类比为IKEA家具组装说明和橄榄球教练的比赛计划。但这是否过于简化了系统的本质？系统不仅仅是步骤的集合，更是一个动态的、相互关联的要素网络。

2. **概念溯源**
   - 客户生命周期的概念源于市场营销理论，但将其直接应用于B2B和B2C场景是否恰当？B2B和B2C的客户关系本质不同，生命周期模型可能需要调整。

3. **假设解构**
   - 文中假设"站在客户角度"就能提供卓越服务。但这是否忽视了客户需求的多样性和复杂性？单一视角可能无法全面理解客户体验。

4. **辩证分析**
   - 从正面看，系统化和客户生命周期管理确实能提高效率。但从反面看，过度系统化可能导致僵化，忽视个性化需求。
   - 站在客户角度固然重要，但企业也需要平衡客户需求和自身资源限制。

5. **刷新表述**
   - 系统应该是灵活的框架，而非僵化的步骤。它应该能够适应不同场景和需求。
   - 客户生命周期管理需要区分B2B和B2C的特点，制定不同的策略。
   - "站在客户角度"应该是持续的过程，而非一次性行为。企业需要建立机制来持续收集和分析客户反馈，动态调整服务。

通过这种系统性怀疑，我们可以得出更深入的见解：真正的卓越服务在于在系统化和个性化之间找到平衡，在理解客户需求和实现商业目标之间达成统一。这需要持续的反思和调整，而非简单地遵循既定步骤。
