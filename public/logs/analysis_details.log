[P3]  When we look at the back end of Spotify and Apple and our audio channels, the majority of people that watch this podcast haven't yet hit the follow button or the subscribe button, wherever you're listening to this. I would like to make a deal with you. If you could do me a huge favour and hit that subscribe button, I will work tirelessly from now until forever to make the show better and better and better and better. I can't tell you how much it helps when you hit that subscribe button. The show gets bigger, which means we can expand the production, bring in all the guests you want to see and continue to doing this thing we love. If you could do me that small favour and hit the follow button, 
[P4]  wherever you're listening to this, that would mean the world to me. That is the only favour I will ever ask you. Thank you so much for your time. Back to this episode. You guys are three of the best commentators, the most articulate people I know that also have the most interesting, broad experience and also I think political background. So I wanted to talk to you about everything that's going on in the world. And I wanted to ask you guys some of the dumb questions that I ponder alone with myself and with my dumb friends in my WhatsApp group.

[P1] ﻿ The world is absolutely crazy right now. This is one of the most interesting moments of social, cultural and economic transition that I have ever seen. So I wanted to do something that I've never done before. I called upon three of the leading voices on social, cultural, business and economic issues to give their unfiltered, uncensored points of view so that we can all make sense of all of this craziness happening before our eyes. They don't always agree on much, but today they thrash it out to see if they can agree on something. 
[P2]  Go through the economy, Trump, Elon Musk, EEI, censorship, wokeism, and why so many men are struggling. Why are tens of thousands of millionaires running away from the UK? The terrifying truth and opportunity in AI. And I ask all of them, what is the most important thing in 2025 that nobody is talking about? With the aim of reaching clarity, agreement, and having a laugh in the process. This is the episode you probably didn't know you needed.

主题：美国社会文化经济转型讨论

输入内容：
[P5]  It feels to me that the world is at a real moment of transition in many regards. So like social transition, cultural transition, economic transition. And I think the US has been a catalyst for all of that. So that's why I wanted to have this conversation today. We've got an American here, Scott. I think Scott's the only American here. We've got Constantine. We've got Daniel, who are two Brits, but spend a lot of time between America as well. And so I want to come to Scott first and ask Scott a question, which is a very big, broad question, 
[P6]  your perspective, Scott, you know, when I talk about this feeling of transition, that seems to be like almost inside my chest, that we're at a really historic moment. What is your analysis on this? What is the big picture here? What's happened over the last three, four, five, six, seven months? And how is that going to impact all of us around the world? Well, if you think of the US as setting the tone economically, and maybe even culturally for the West, there's definitely a reversion away from 
[P7]  people feel that quote-unquote wokeism, and I don't like to use that word, but I'll use it here, was this sort of overcorrection to systemic racism and that it began to cause more damage than it was or cause more problems than it was solving. And I think there's been a serious kind of lurch back, if you will, whether it's executive actions declaring the border, a state of emergency, stuff around saying that gender is a thing, 
[P8]  and female. And most of these issues, the actually American public supports, I would say on a more cynical level, America used to be a platform for prosperity, the protection of civil rights, the projection of women's rights and power and democracy abroad. And I would argue that it feels like a pretty quick transition to almost like a, you know, I call it a kleptocracy, but America has become a platform for 
[P9]  acquiring wealth and then leveraging that wealth as a means or a proxy of power. And the ultimate example of that was the launch of two meme coins, the Trump coin and the Melania coin, the day before the presidency, such that this conversation could have already or might happen this week. And I'll finish here. President Trump, it's Vlad. We're thinking about stabilizing our currency or trying to send the outflows of our reserves. 
[P10]  into the Trump coin, which, based on my economist estimation, would take the value of it to a $20 or $30 billion market cap, making you one of the wealthiest men in the world, Mr. Trump. And none of this would be disclosable or transparent. Also, in unrelated news, we'd really appreciate you seizing arms shipments to Ukraine. So I think we've gone kind of full kleptocracy is the way I would describe it. Are you optimistic, Scott? Well, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy.

输入内容：
[P20]  left lost its way in your view? And if so, how did that happen? And just to respond on some of Constantine's points about Trump being the best of a sort of right-wing collective, are we going to see right-wing sort of ideology spread throughout the Western world over the coming years? What's your take on all of the above? You definitely, you know, we Democrats, we get it right and then we just go too damn far. And so I look at, I'm a professor on a campus, 
[P21]  DEI, 60 years ago, there were 12 black people at Princeton, Yale, and Harvard combined. That was a problem. Race-based affirmative action makes sense. This year, more than half of Harvard's freshman class identifies as non-white. But 70% of those non-whites come from dual-income homes in the upper quintile of income-earning homes. The academic gap between black and white used to be double what it was between rich and poor. It's now flipped. So DEI was a good idea that, quite frankly, has gone insane 
[P22]  system it was trying to do away with. And then we created two candidates who were the only candidates who could make each other viable. Vice President Harris, given the hand she dealt with, did the best she did. I think President Biden should be buried in a crypt entitled narcissist who decided that it made sense for him to go back on his pledge to be a transition candidate and gave us a British-style election timing on the Democratic side in a marketplace. 
[P23]  or you need time and money. So it was not, we did not have a great candidate. There is an understandable swing back from what is an overcorrection around some of these issues. You know, parents, we gave them a huge issue with transgender rights. There's more Padel players in California than transgender people. And yet the Democrats decided to conflate it with the civil rights movement and think that it was okay for a woman who transitioned, a transgender woman, 
[P24]  enter a bicycle race and finish five minutes before everybody else, and then we all bark up the same tree and decide that it's inspiring. And parents all over the nation are saying, we've literally gone crazy. Where I would disagree a little bit with Constantine is that America choosing economic growth and prosperity, there are 190 sovereign nations in the world. 189 would change places with America over the last four years. We hit 71 new record highs in the markets, 97% of all AI. We've created more market capitalization 
[P25]  in a seven-mile radius of SFO International Airport than Europe's created in the last 20 years. We have the lowest inflation in the G7. We have the highest growth. We've grown 10% since 2020. That's triple the rate of Europe. Biden was unable to communicate any of that effectively because there's this psychological dynamic that when your wages go up, you credit your own grit and character, and when the price of cereal goes up, you blame the president. Now, similar to the future, or how William Gibson described the future, 
[P26]  It's here. It's just not evenly distributed. Prosperity is unprecedented in the U.S. over the last four years. It just wasn't evenly distributed. Now, having said that, in America, you can stop working in August and you've produced more and made more money than you have in Europe the whole year. And it has gotten better. It says things are less bad than anywhere in the world in the U.S. Biden was unable to communicate it. And then talking about how great the economy is when rents were skyrocketing, tuition was going up, it was an ineffective strategy. 
[P27]  But I don't think it's fair to say Americans chose prosperity. We have prosperity.

[P94]  and they're from a diverse background, you know, it calls into question why they got that job in the first place, which I think is horrible. You know, I just hired from two candidates, the final two candidates was a guy and a woman. I would hate if the woman felt that she got the job because she's a woman and not because she's best. She turns out she was by far the best in the process. And I would love for her to know that there was absolutely nothing that changed our view. 
[P95]  We weren't trying to fill a position with a woman. We were trying to fill the position with the best, and she should know she was the best. I think the contrast that was really fascinating was between Trump's website and the Democrats' website. So in the Democrats' website, it was who we're for, which was what Scott was saying. But Trump's website was the 20 things we're going to do, and it was just a list of 20. These are the 20 action points. This is what we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this. 
[P96]  as opposed to the identities that we want to advantage list. And I think that was the choice. You know, at the beginning, Constantine, you said, you know, America had a choice. And for me, when I looked at those two websites, I saw this choice between the identities being the main thing or the to-do list being the main thing and very different approaches. Scott, when I was listening to that Zuckerberg interview talking about masculinity and identity issues, one of the lines he said in there, 
[P97]  like something you've said on my show before, where he said, I think having a culture that celebrates that aggression a little bit more, talking about masculinity, has its own merits that are really positive. Now, Mark Zuckerberg isn't necessarily someone that I saw closely aligning to your worldview. Am I right in thinking that that's something you agree with? Because I remember you saying to me, you think people should be able to walk in a room and kick everyone's ass. What I've said on your show is that I think the male form, especially under the age of 30, 
[P98]  with its bone structure, incredible double-twitch muscle, and then this amazing, amazing chemical called testosterone, you're going to look back at your 25-year-old self and think, why wasn't I a fucking monster like Steve Barley? And also, there is some masculinity when Russian soldiers pour over the border in Ukraine. You want some of that big dick energy that Daniel was talking about. In the case of Zuckerberg, 
[P99]  I don't think he really understands an aspirational view of masculinity. I think when he couches immediately kind of trying to kiss Trump's ass because Trump threatened to put him in prison, and what he used to call moderation, he's now calling censorship. And when you have an algorithm that elevates incendiary hateful content, I would not describe that as masculinity. For me, masculinity comes down to protection, providing, and procreation. 
[P100]  Iадib Axel- He's about gendering a workplace in the context of trying to excuse a total elimination of what I would think is probably healthy moderation. I imagine Daniel and Constantine might have a different view. 
[P101]  Right now, when I talk about masculinity, you know, there's if I say at a conference, oh, women are better managers. Everyone goes, yes, that's right. That's right. Right. That's OK. If I say men are more risk aggressive and make better entrepreneurs, you're a misogynist. You're out. And the reality is men and women bring different attributes. But the masculinity and femininity, I think masculinity is a wonderful thing. I think we need a different image of it. I think people born as male have an easier time leaning into those things. 
[P102]  I work out at CrossFit with a bunch of lesbian firefighters. They bring great masculine energy, and they could carry my ass out of a fire. So a lot of men demonstrate wonderful feminine qualities. A lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculine qualities. I don't think these things are sequestered to anyone born as a specific gender. What I think, when I talk about masculinity, I don't talk about it in the role of corporations. I think that's as fraught with risk and not worth talking about. It should be about shareholder value or stakeholder value. 
[P103]  I think young men need a code. We're going to church less. We have fewer relationships. So what's the code you hold on to in terms of creating behaviors that are productive for you, yourself, society? And I think masculinity needs to be redefined as something more aspirational where you're celebrated for being really fucking strong. You're celebrated for not complaining. You're celebrated for creating surplus value. You create more tax revenue than you absorb. You're celebrated for being aggressive. You're celebrated for breaking up fights at bars. 
[P104]  not starting them. You're celebrated for protecting your country, not shitposting it. You're celebrated for approaching strange women and expressing romantic interest. That's not a crime. And if she's not interested and you're rejected, you're both going to be fine. You're celebrated for getting out of the house. You're celebrated for working. You're celebrated for making money and liking money. I think there just needs to be a redefinition of masculinity in the context of helping young men 
[P105]  code that they used to get from the armed services or from dual parent households. And I feel like they're struggling. So I like the idea of something that they feel in their bones and in their body and in their DNA that they can lean into that we celebrate. And the conversation is flipped entirely. Five years ago, I was called a misogynist for talking about masculinity. Now the conversation is being led and advocated by one group, and it's mothers who are like, 
[P106]  My son is not doing well. I got three kids, two daughters, daughters in PR with the other ones at Penn, and my son is in the basement vaping and playing video games. He needs something to latch on to. He needs a code. Anyways, but I apologize. Word salad. Zuckerberg and masculinity, give me a fucking break. He looks like a Chechen Molly dealer. Sorry, back to you, Stephen. Well, it's interesting when you speak, Scott, because your views on masculinity 
[P107]  me to be most better represented by the right side of politics than the left side of politics. They both have their own vision of masculinity. And yours seems to be a Republican view of masculinity. To Trump's credit, he saw the opportunity and he flew right into the manosphere. Rockets, crypto, Joe Rogan, Theo Vaughn. He said, no, I'm not going to run from this. I'm going to fly right into it. Now, I would argue that his vision of masculinity has too much 
[P108]  coarseness, too much cruelty, too much bullying. I don't think that's masculinity. I think when we talk about Elon Musk taking risks, sending rockets that are captured by scissors coming down, inspiring the EV race, taking an enormous risk, making a shit ton of money. Yeah, that's a great form of masculinity. Accusing men trying to save high soccer players, calling them pedophiles, calling your employees a sex criminal such that they have to leave their house, having 13 kids by five women or three women, none of which you live with, 
[P109]  Sleeping next to a loaded gun, losing control of your self-control because of addiction. I don't think that's a great role model. I think it's an amazing role model for boys. I don't think it's a great role model for men. In terms of energy, there are so many reasons why I'm a big matcha fan, if you don't already know by now. And so much so that I actually invested in the UK's leading matcha company called Perfect Ted. And one of my favorite Perfect Ted products is these delicious matcha pouches that come in every flavor from salted caramel, 
[P110]  to peach flavor, to mint flavor, to berry flavor. One of my favorites is this vanilla flavor, which I'm going to make in just two seconds. You just take this mixer here, get a little bit of the powder, pop it on top of the shaker like that. Put the lid on. Shake, shake, shake. Delicious. If you haven't tried this yet, you can find Perfect Ted at Tesco and Holland Barrett stores or online where you can get 40% off with my code, Diary40. 
[P111]  put in code Diary40 to try this delicious multi-flavored matcha now. Highly recommend. And if you do it, please tag me, send me a message online. Do you know that 80% of New Year's resolutions fail by February? It's because we focus too much on the end goal and we forget the small daily actions that actually move us forward. Those actions that are easy to do are also easy not to do in life. It's easy to save a dollar, so it's also easy not to. Making one small improvement each day, one tiny step in the right direction, has a big difference over time. 
[P112]  mindset, which is why we created The 1% Diary, a 90-day journal designed to help you stay consistent and focus on the small wins and make real progress over time. It also gives you access to The 1% Community, a space where you can stay accountable, motivated, inspired, along with many others on the same journey. We launched The 1% Diary in November and it sold out. So now we're doing a second drop. Head to thediary.com to grab yours before it sells out again. I'll put the link below. 
[P113]  Censorship. The word censorship was used there by Scott. We've seen this reversal in Meta's attitude, Facebook's attitude that had been built up over a decade, where it almost felt like if you had sort of right-leaning views or really any unaccepted views and you posted those on Facebook, you would face maybe having the post deleted or your account suspended. This new world of speech, of free speech, and as it pertains to masculinity. 
[P114]  noticed, Scott, you'd left X. You no longer post or tweet on X anymore. Do you think Elon's decision to buy X is a net positive for society? Net, yes. But I think what people hear when you say that is there's no problems with this system than, you know, compared to the ones we had before. There are definitely disadvantages to a free platform like X now. And one of them is 
[P115]  inevitably when you remove censorship, one of the things the censorship was doing was keeping all the deeply unpleasant people away from being able to shove things in your face. And that happens quite a lot on it. So I don't enjoy that aspect of it. But I've always said that would be the price that we would pay for freedom. Freedom always has a price, and that's what we're seeing. As for Zuckerberg, his miraculous transformation into a free speech warrior 
[P116]  And I'm delighted to welcome him. I'm sure it's entirely genuine and not anything to do with the election results we've just seen in any way whatsoever. And the fact that the culture shifted and those of us who were being censored by people like him for years actually winning the argument. Well, what it shows you is we've won the argument on free speech when it comes to the big tech platforms. And it's going to be messy. 
[P117]  that are algorithmically driven, where the truth and the moderate reasonable take is not what usually gets attention, you're going to see a lot of unpleasantness. I value the ability to hear and communicate truthful ideas and facts over my own subjective feelings. Oh, someone said a thing I don't like or someone was racist or someone was misogynistic. I don't enjoy the fact that that happens. 
[P118]  but I would rather that happened and also we were not being censored from saying, you know, COVID probably came from a lab in China, which we were. You know, the Hunter Biden laptop story isn't Russian disinformation. Actually, it's an important piece of information that American voters need to hear when they're making their decision about the election. And all of these other things that were being suppressed and censored across social media for years, they're not anymore. 
[P119]  that's a good thing. And I think that's helpful. And if you look at, you know, to bring it back to the UK for a moment, Stephen, as you know, on Trigonometry, we've tried to cover the grooming gangs scandal and is an outrage what happened in this country over decades. We've been covering that for years, since about 2019, 2020, to very little purchase. And one of the reasons is it was just something that the media sort of covered and then moved on, when it actually should have been something we talked about on 
[P120]  daily basis until serious action was taken. And we saw real, real change, real change in policing, real change in social work, real change in government, real change in the way that these racially aggravated hate crimes were treated. Well, none of that was really being talked about seriously until Elon kicked up a fuss, amplified the voices of survivors, amplified the voices of campaigners on X, which he bought. And now the British government is forced 
[P121]  to do whatever it can to actually address those issues to the extent that it will. A lot of people will say it still doesn't go far enough. Well, if it doesn't go far enough, we now have a platform from which we can continue to have that conversation until there is the sort of inquiry and the sort of outcomes that people want to actually deliver real change. So is that a positive? God, yes. God, yes. We needed that.

输入内容：
[P11]  I don't know if I'm just getting older, but no, I don't see a man convicted of sexual abuse or found liable who inspired an insurrection retaking the White House as a point of light for the American experience. Constantine, I suspect you'd have a slightly different view on all of the above. How are you feeling about everything that happened yesterday? Did you watch the inauguration? What is your big picture, 30,000 feet view? 
[P12]  make bold predictions about what's going to happen over the next six to seven months. I do think what America had at the election and what the election of Donald Trump represents is something that we in the UK don't have, which is choice. They had a very clear choice between two very different perspectives on the world, between two very different approaches, between two very different candidates. And ultimately, criticisms of President Trump are necessary and legitimate. Of course they are. 
[P13]  But at the end of the day, I believe having spent quite a lot of time in America around election time and also just generally and traveling around real America, not just in D.C. and L.A. and New York. The reason that he was elected was that the American people are not prepared to accept what Europeans have decided they're prepared to accept, which is managed decline. The American people do not want their country to become weaker. They do not want it to become poorer. 
[P14]  impoverish their fellow citizens through net zero. What they want is their country to be great, their country to be powerful, their country to be influential. The economic realities for most Americans are not really reflected in the figures that we are told. So when people talk about inflation, the reality of people's lives on the ground is that their cost of living has gone up very, very significantly over the last few years. 
[P15]  overall inflation figure that we're shown because certain things are much more influential in people's lives than others. And so whether the decision to elect President Trump ends up being this positive thing for which there should be lots of optimism is a matter of the next four years. Are we going to see a presidency that really does everything it promises? And by the way, you know, if you look at the things that Donald Trump is promising, 
[P16]  Whether you're left or right, you have to acknowledge that they are things that are worth doing. Having a secure border so that people don't come into your country illegally is a basic duty of government. Economic prosperity is a basic duty of government. Withdrawing America from a kind of simultaneously aggressive but weak posture around the world where America sort of says, yeah, yeah, we're going to get involved in these foreign conflicts, 
[P17]  win that war is a kind of stupid position on both whichever side you're on. So on all of these things, and of course, you know, Scott mentioned wokeness. I think he's absolutely right that there is a massive backlash happening around the world because lots and lots of people who were completely apolitical until the last three or four years or maybe until 2016 just feel like the world has gone crazy and suddenly they're supposed to pretend that men can change sex and become women and now they're 
[P18]  entitled to be in female prisons. And, you know, if your teenager says that they are the opposite sex, you're supposed to chop their breasts off and all of this other stuff that ordinary people just look at and go, this is crazy. Like, I am liberal, but this isn't liberal. This is some kind of weird thing that's going on. And I see the backlash against all of that all over the Western world. And I think Donald Trump signifies that people are fed up of that. 
[P19]  that if the woke left continues to exercise this level of influence on our public debate, the reaction will be the rise of the right. And Donald Trump is one of the most diplomatic and pleasant versions of what you're likely to get if the left keeps going crazy. We will see what challenges the world throws at him over the next four years and whether he's capable of responding to them.

主题：英国经济与企业家精神讨论

输入内容：
[P28]  My favorite appointment in the Trump administration in the adult room is the 10 year bond, which is going to say, sorry, girlfriend, when I believe the president tries to implement some of these economic policies. Constantine, is that true? Because what I heard there is that effectively Trump had a better marketing campaign. And that reality is somewhat different from what the Americans were sold in the last election cycle. Well, politics is about marketing and Trump is the marketer in chief. 
[P29]  and partly that's what politics is about. But in terms of the economy, I think Scott is entirely right. It's one of the reasons I admire America so much, the sense of dynamism and economic growth and the desire to create things and build things. It's an observation I've had every time I've been there. You know, if you have a successful restaurant in the UK, you go, well, I've got a successful restaurant. In America, if you have a successful restaurant, you open a second one and a third one and you create a chain, right? So their attitude to business more broadly is, 
[P30]  is fantastic and I love it. But I think the difference is that I don't think Americans were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the European economies. They were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the American economy under Donald Trump in his first term and also what they expect him to do for the future. When they look at the fact that he's got real business leaders in government now, like Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk talking about government efficiency, 
[P31]  all Western countries have a massively bloated civil service, what we call civil service in the UK and the administrative state in the US that wastes a huge amount of money, that produces very little in terms of output in many cases. And that needs to be slimmed down. And people, I think, are very excited about that. And when I talk to business leaders in America, including ones that were never on the Trump train, so to speak, so many of them went over to his side in this election cycle. 
[P32]  because they just felt that he was going to continue to accelerate American growth and continue to deliver prosperity for the American people. Now, Scott's point about tariffs and all of these other things, you know, I've listened to Donald Trump enough now to know that you should not necessarily be taking him literally. I think many of the things he says are negotiation tactics and signaling. 
[P33]  build this or do that or do this. You have to sort of read between the lines when he says, you know, this will be the worst thing that you just go. He's saying to people like, you better work with me. Otherwise, this is going to work out badly for you on all of these things. And so it remains to be seen whether he's successful in those tactics of getting what he wants. Look, America is always going to be an unequal society. It's designed in a way that is going to make it that way. In America, the focus is how do we grow the pie? 
[P34]  In Europe, the focus is how do we divide it up so everyone gets their fair little share, right? So Americans are about expanding the pie and then the people who bake the pie get as much of it as they possibly can. But the question is, can there be a sense in America that the American dream is alive, that you do not have to work three gig economy jobs to pay your rent, that you're going to be able to buy a house, that you're going to be able to afford to have children, 
[P35]  raise a family, perhaps on a single income, something that most people only dream about nowadays. That's really what this whole economic conversation is about. And we will see over the next four years if Donald Trump is able to slightly even change the direction of travel towards those things that actually Americans of my generation and older used to take for granted as the promise of the country that they live in. I've thought a lot about this over the last couple of weeks in particular, 
[P36]  papers in the UK that millionaires are leaving the UK in historic numbers. I think it's 10,800 millionaires left last year, which is an increase of about 160% versus the previous year. And the general sentiment in terms of business confidence in the UK is at a several year low. So I think it's the lowest it's been since just post pandemic. There's this, I think it's the Institute of Accountants, they call up 1000 accountants every year, and they get they run a survey to see how much confidence 
[P37]  they have in business in this country. And it's fallen 14 points to 0.2% confidence in terms of business. But there's this bigger narrative emerging amongst my entrepreneurial friends that if you want to start a business right now, the best place to be in the world is to be in America, is to get over to America and to leave the UK. Now, Dan, how does that score? I know you have an accelerator, you speak to lots of entrepreneurs. How does that sort of compare or contrast with what you're seeing at the moment? Yeah, 100%. The value proposition for the UK has dropped through the floor. 
[P38]  Very, very high tax. The ecosystem of business is in decline. Some of the smartest people are now in Dubai. Some incredible creators that I know have moved to Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai. Many are going to the USA. So if people are interested in bigger markets and bigger opportunities, they're into the USA. If they're interested in lower tax and more fringe opportunities, they're in the Middle East. 
[P39]  a place in the world. I think there are three business models the UK could go for, which is either the head office of Europe, which is what we were when we were inside the EU, and everyone used to come here to build a European business. We could be the back office of the USA, so the incubator for the USA. A lot of smart companies get to their first 50 million of value here in the UK and then sell to a US private equity firm or US listed company. 
[P40]  And a lot of US companies are now actually coming here to poach talent or to outsource things to the UK more cheaply than they could do it in the US. The wages in the UK are through the floor compared to what you would pay in the US, especially in tech roles. So very smart people in the UK are massively devalued. 
[P41]  tax, model of Dubai, Singapore, you know, those kind of options. So we haven't really picked one of those three yet. We're still, you know, all these years after Brexit, and we haven't said which of those three models we want to adopt. Scott, you moved here a couple of years ago to the UK. And despite everything that's going on in the UK, are you still bullish on this being a place for entrepreneurship and business? I was looking at some stats 
[P42]  of key areas of concern for me. Business stats I've talked about there, the drop in business confidence, the entrepreneur exodus that we're seeing, but things like knife crime in the UK are up 81% over the last decade, which I think is a symptom probably of something else. And one of the big things I think a lot about as an entrepreneur at the moment is artificial intelligence. And our investment in artificial intelligence from a global perspective is down about 2000% versus a country like America. So you've moved here, you've brought your family here. 
[P43]  bullish on the UK versus the US from an entrepreneur's perspective? So the question I get most frequently when I speak here is to compare and contrast the US with the UK. And I use a personal anecdote. My parents immigrated to the US from Glasgow and London when they were 19 and 22. They took enormous risks. I've been an entrepreneur my whole life. I like to think that a lot of my success isn't my fault, that I inherited sort of that risk-taking DNA. And when I speak to people in the UK, I say the primary difference is 
[P44]  And that is, it kind of comes down to a risk appetite. The U.S. has five times per capita the number of entrepreneurs. It has five times the dollar volume per startup. There's $5 million in venture capital waiting to be deployed for every startup in the U.S. versus $1 million in Europe. I love what Constantine said about a restaurant. I went into this great little restaurant in Soho a few weeks ago called Dig In, and I loved it so much. I left my card and said, can you have the owner? 
[P45]  I'd like to open another one. Does he need money? I just would never do that here. I thought that was a really interesting insight. And the collision of risk, crazy ideas that occasionally become crazy genius and technology and intellectual property and great universities results in a company that no one had heard of five years ago being worth more than the entire UK stock market, NVIDIA. So there's just an enormous difference. 
[P46]  my impression of the UK economy, I'll just say London. I have no experience in it. I don't go anywhere that's not walking distance from Marlebone. So my bubble is pretty opaque. But the way I would describe the economy here is I love the term the butler economy. And that is all the money I see being made here is people servicing wealth created somewhere else. You're either in financial services servicing rich people. You're either opening a restaurant or hospitality. 
[P47]  quality servicing rich people, but I don't see a lot of organic wealth creation. I interviewed the two, quote unquote, inventors of AI at one of your prestigious universities. My first question is, how the hell were you not able to make any money if you invented AI? Why haven't you been able to capture any money? But just for your listeners, my summation of Europe versus the US after molesting the earth for the last 35 years is US is still the best place to make money and Europe is still the best place to spend it. Is this a failing nation, Scott? 
[P48]  I think you have too much going for you to be described as a failing nation. You still have amazing universities. London's still the second best city in the world. Premier League, it's an unbelievable export. I know how ridiculous that sounds. People want to be here. There's still rule of law, rule of play. You still produce amazing rock and roll. I just don't see how you could say this is a failed. I would argue that second only to our entry into Iraq, 
[P49]  An American can't understand why you would decide to increase your prices while reducing productivity in one fell swoop. It's difficult for us to wrap our heads around some of the economic decisions the UK has made. But I think a lot of people are kind of betting or hoping that the UK begins to grow again. So in a weird way, I would call myself cautiously optimistic about the UK. I think at some point it registers.

主题：DEI政策与社会公平讨论

输入内容：
[P75]  Together, that's what we're supposed to do. And these stupid gender wars and this idea that men as a group are this and women as a group are that, all of that just needs to end. I was watching last night as Trump sat there signing all of those executive orders. And I also watched his inauguration speak where he said, we will forge a society that is colourblind and merit-based. And he signed a bunch of executive orders last night to eliminate a variety of different DEI programmes in the federal government, 
[P76]  We've seen 
[P77]  whack DEI measures. So I think there's a lot of nuance here. I would argue in universities, DEI is used as a giant misdirect from people such as myself who are enforcers of the caste system and wake up every morning and look in the mirror and ask ourselves the same question. How do I increase my compensation while decreasing my accountability? And what I found is the ultimate strategy is to create an LVMH rejectionist bullshit, elitist strategy, where Dartmouth sits on a 
[P78]  endowment of $8 billion and lets in 500 kids. So the conversation around who gets in is a misdirect from the important question that is how many. If you are not growing your endowment or your freshman class faster than population, you should lose your tax-free status. We should be letting in more gay kids, more trans kids, more white Republicans from rural state. You know who doesn't talk about DEI? Junior colleges, because there's no admissions. They don't have a problem with DEI. 
[P79]  own tail, started out with the right idea. Now it's nothing. And I would argue the same is somewhat true of the Democratic Party. I went to the Democratic National Convention. On the dnc.org website, it lists 17 special introscripts, and it says explicitly who we serve, Asian Pacific Islanders, seniors, veterans, Black Americans, the disabled. It basically lists, I added this up, 76% of the population. And when you say you're actively advocating for 76% 
[P80]  of the population. You're not advocating for 76% of the population. You're discriminating against the 24%. It's gone too far. I would argue in the workplace, having served on seven public company boards, and I'm going to do a lot of boasting here because I'm desperate for all of your affirmation, and 12 private company boards, there's still work to be done in the private sector. There still is a cycle. 40% of all venture capitalists and probably 70% or 80% of all venture capital deployed 
[P81]  are white guys from just two universities, Stanford and Harvard. So I would argue universities, it's gotten out of control. I'd love to see the DEI apparatus disassembled, along with the ethics department, the sustainability department, the leadership department. These are all bullshit where we hire formerly important people with no standards. They never get fired. It just translates to more student debt. In the boardroom, in corporations, in certain sectors, I do think there is a need to be thoughtful about broadening the aperture of the lens 
[P82]  people who are underrepresented. There's still a dearth of women raising venture capital. So I think it's nuanced based on sector. But to just say all DEI is bad, I want to move to where the University of California did in 1997. They don't have race-based affirmative action. They have adversity-based affirmative action. I'm a beneficiary of affirmative action. I had something called Pell Grants. I was raised by a single immigrant mother who lived and died as secretary. So I got grants. I had 
[P83]  unfair advantage because I came from a household that was low income. And I think that there should be affirmative action. And I think it should be based on color, but that color is green. The poor need our help. The moment you start advocating for a special advantage based on any external factors, I think at this point in our society, it probably causes more problems than it solves. That's exactly right. That's exactly right, Stephen. 
[P84]  take a step back and look at why DEI has become such a big part of the conversation, it's precisely because instead of addressing the reality of people's lives, which is some people are disadvantaged and some people are advantaged, actually what we've mainly done, and Scott alluded to at the very beginning of our discussion, is we've given a leg up to very wealthy ethnic minority people from successful families, and they now, their children now get into 
[P85]  prestigious universities, which they probably would have done anyway, some of them, because they come from very advanced backgrounds. And the kids that are growing up in poverty, black and white, have no shot whatsoever. But the reason that it's become such a big issue around the Western world, actually, I don't think it's the nuances that we've delved into here, but actually something else, which is we have created the most ethnically diverse societies in history. And what I mean by that is, 
[P86]  not that we've created societies in which there are large groups of people who are different from each other, but for the first time probably in human history, we've created societies in which there is a lot of ethnic diversity and there is no overt discrimination against some groups of people in the sense of, you know, the imperial societies in the past would have had one dominant ethnic group, which is, you know, the Russians in the Soviet Union or the Turks in the Ottoman Empire 
[P87]  in the British Empire, whatever. That was the ethnic group that was like the dominant one. And everybody else was a kind of second-class citizen and everybody knew it, right? We don't have that anymore. We have highly diverse societies where people of every single background exist in which we have this idea that we're all supposed to be equal. And when we have programs that explicitly discriminate against people, there were times when the discrimination was explicit 
[P88]  black people. Well, we've gone full circle now where the discrimination was going the other way in university admissions, in hiring, in corporate America, in government, in all sorts of things. You know, in this country, the BBC has internships that aren't available to white people, etc. When you get to that point, as Scott said earlier on, everyone just goes, look, I know I'm not supposed to say this, but the reality is this is racism. This is a form of racism. And I thought we were trying to get away from the 
[P89]  So to the extent that the elimination of DEI is about creating a merit-based society in which people are given an opportunity because they're skilled and talented and they have the potential to actually achieve things and create wealth. You know, we all know this. We all employ people, right? How many of us are thinking about the races of the people we hire? I don't think we think about that at all. What we're thinking about is I run a business. I need the very best personable. 
[P90]  very best possible person for this job at the price I'm willing to pay. I don't care if they are purple, green, blue, white, whatever. It doesn't matter. What matters is, are we getting the best person for the job? And my concern about identity politics has always been that if we do not adopt that worldview, then what we will do is create a worldview in which we have different racial groups competing with each other on the basis of race. 
[P91]  very dangerous mix for a multi-ethnic society like ours, which is why I've been begging people to let go of this stupid idea of identity politics and to say, first and foremost, we are all Brits or we are all Americans. We have this umbrella identity under which we all operate and our personal ethnicity or sex or whatever is secondary to that and actually for the purposes of employment, for the purposes of college admission, et cetera, is irrelevant. 
[P92]  Yes, if there is disadvantage, if we grew up in a single-parent home with a low income, we may need some extra support there. If we had terrible schooling or our education was not good, we may need extra support. If there's certain things that make it easier for us because of the disadvantages we've had to fulfill our talent and potential, I am all for that. But what we've created so far, and that's why I'm delighted it's being eliminated, is an anti-meritocratic system which says, 
[P93]  We don't care what you bring to the workplace. We don't care whether you deserve this place or not. We don't care about the potential you have. Actually, we just needed an insert category tick box to fill this slot. And you filled it. It doesn't really matter that you're not doing your job very well because now we can say, you know, we're a diverse company. I don't care about that and we shouldn't care about that as a society. And thank God that's now gone. Yeah, I think the worst part about it too is that it calls into question

主题：未来社会与教育系统展望

输入内容：
[P122]  by someone like Elon Musk on a platform like X, which is now free, to the point where Keir Starmer is forced into defensive action. I wish that was around 30 years ago because a hell of a lot of young girls and women wouldn't have suffered the way they did if we had the opportunity to get that message out. So, God, yes, it's a net positive. Just to pick up on that, Constantine, I've had a question in my mind for a while regarding the scandal, which is horrific, I think it's something we all definitely agree on, is why has Elon chosen 
[P123]  now? And why has he chosen Keir Starmer as the sort of central target of this flurry of tweets around the grooming scandals? Because there's clearly, Elon's, I think, an individual which you can kind of see thinking in real time. Like if you go back through his tweets, because there's so many of them, and they kind of come in these spurts, you can almost see what he's getting at. Is there an underlying reason why he's made this a central issue over the last couple of weeks? 
[P124]  is actually most Americans were completely unaware of this issue until recently. I remember a year ago speaking at a private event in New York and somebody said to me, well, you know, what is the consequence of political correctness? Why are you so against it? Why are you so against censorship? And I talked about the grooming gangs and people were horrified. They hadn't even, and these are well-informed, educated people who are media savvy and whatever. So one of the reasons is I think to a lot of Americans, this issue is only coming to the fore. 
[P125]  now in front of their mind. The second issue, I think, is that Elon Musk understands what I said earlier, which is we have a global Western culture now. And so what happens in Britain matters just as much as what happens in America, because we are symbiotic with each other now. When there's a restriction of speech in the UK, when we have laws about what people are not allowed to say, that has an impact across the world. When you see the European Union trying to pass legislation, 
[P126]  about online censorship. That has an impact because if something exists in the UK and in many European countries, it's only a matter of time before people in America are going to say, well, look, they've got this in Europe. Why don't we bring it over here? And vice versa. So what happens in America affects us in Europe and in the UK. And what happens in Europe and the UK affects America. So what Elon, I think, is trying to do is to say, we care about our civilization. Elon doesn't really talk that much about the United States. 
[P127]  about our civilization as I do, because I believe that we are now one thing to a very significant extent. Now, from our civilizational point of view, is it a good thing that mass rape gangs in the UK are being insufficiently investigated and treated improperly by the police and the government? No, it's not. It's a very bad thing. So how do we address that? Well, we address that by putting pressure on the government of the day. Now, I don't see the grooming gangs as a party political issue. 
[P128]  it properly, although there were individual members of the cabinet that tried to do something like Sir Le Braverman. But he's putting pressure on the government of the day. You can see him going after Nigel Farage, of all people, and saying Nigel Farage is not the right leader for reform. So he's attempting to shape British politics in the direction that he feels is the right way. What does he want? What outcome does he want? Look, I don't know what Elon Musk wants. I don't know him personally. I haven't even yet had a chance 
[P129]  to interview him, which I really look forward to doing, because I think he's one of the great visionaries of our time. Whether you like him or not, I think that's undeniably true. But my sense is he's trying to talk about all the things that we've been discussing, freedom of expression, the end of identity politics and the pursuit of meritocracy, a pioneering, inspiring vision of the future, which is why he's talking about Mars and a vision for our civilization that goes beyond the narrow squabbling 
[P130]  here on Earth. And the understanding that human beings are meant, we left the cave. We're not supposed to stay in a place with the walls closing in on us and feel like we're in decline. We're not supposed to be a civilization that has 1.5 children per woman and that is simply just leaving the planet Earth because we can't reproduce. We're supposed to look at the future with hope and optimism. We're supposed to say, 
[P131]  I want things to be better for my children. I want to have children. I want the vision of our society being one of positivity and optimism and a sense of a pioneering vision and inspiration. That's what I think he wants. And I don't really see any of that in the current government in the UK. And I think he's right to go after them and say, you are destroying your country's economy. You're destroying its culture. You're destroying its sense of cohesiveness by allowing illegal immigration. 
[P132]  You are destroying that sense of optimism and vision. And you're not saying to people, let's build something better. You're saying, let's stay small. Let's play small. Let's not rise above our station. And I think we need people like that, imperfect as they may be in all sorts of different ways, to drive our civilization forward, to say to us, there is an inspiring vision to which we're all moving, as opposed to just sitting there and waiting to die, which is what we've been doing for far too long. 
[P133]  I think Elon is taking him at his word. You know, he said a year ago that he was going to absolutely dismantle the woke mind virus globally and he was going to ensure meritocracy and free speech. And when he sets his mind on something, he has the ability to stay focused on it for a very long time to a degree most people can't fathom. You know, and he's absolutely willing to endure pain. He loves a fight. He obviously has the kind of mind that can't relax unless he's kind of grinding up against some gear. 
[P134]  as well. Like the way he works needs stress in his life. He needs a big enemy. He needs a big fight to engage with. And I think Keir Starmer just ticked all of his boxes as someone to go up against. I think what's interesting is we talk about these big tech. I love that Scott has previously talked about breaking up big tech. And I think there's potential for that in the next four years. All of these guys like Trump and JD Vance and all of them have locked horns with big tech. 
[P135]  and they've come, you know, this is their chance to get revenge on big tech in the next four years. They could do a little, you know, you might see Google have to, you know, spin off YouTube or you might see AWS have to come away from Amazon or something like that. Who knows? But it's interesting that a lot of these big tech guys, they're probably cozying up to Trump because, you know, that could be on the cards as well. There's been a lot of Trump butt kissing over the last couple of weeks. 
[P136]  bragged about the fact that everybody's flown down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss his butt and to cozy up with him. And there's now headlines saying that there's this tech oligarchy forming in the United States where Bezos and Elon and Zuck are all now friends and they're stood behind Trump as this unifying force. Just to touch on a few points of that, but also on Constantine's message that Elon is doing this for the betterment of humanity, to further humanity, his involvement with the UK, but his broader involvement in politics now. Scott, does that square with how you think about Elon? 
[P137]  And I am quite curious to ask you why you made the decision to leave X and to go to Blue Sky and Threads and things like that. Yeah, I can't speculate on what motivates Elon Musk. I quite frankly just don't get the guy. And I don't have the domain expertise to comment on the rape gangs. It's such a serious, upsetting issue. I don't know it well enough to speak intelligently to it. Just the topic of censorship, though, as it relates to meta, 
[P138]  A hallmark of a free society and a democracy is that pretty much anyone can say pretty much anything about pretty much anybody. I believe that. The question is, do machines and bots have free speech rights? Because if I say something, I believe, and I may be paranoid, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong. I believe VCs whose portfolio companies I've said have overvalued have enlisted thousands of bots to basically just shitpost me over and over on X to diminish my credibility. 
[P139]  critical of Putin that the GRU has hired troll farms to create lists of thousands of people to weaponize bots to say disparaging things about them. Do those bots have free speech rights? In addition, when Fox News distributes information to its anchors saying Dominion voting machines were weaponized by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, despite the fact they knew that was not true, but they tell their broadcasters to do it anyways. And then Dominion says, this hurt our business. 
[P140]  and you knew it was false, and you decided to communicate it anyways, courts find them liable. They have to pay three quarters of a billion dollars. What happened at Fox News was a dumpster fire compared to the nuclear mushroom cloud on Meta. So a lot of what we're talking about here, if you want to say that mRNA vaccines alter your DNA, I think you should have the right to say that. The dissenter's voice is important because occasionally the conspiracy theorist ends up being correct. 
[P141]  is, when you have a business model that elevates the most incendiary, ugly content beyond its organic reach, should you then be exonerated from all liability and slander that traditional media companies are liable to? If we were to say that Elon Musk is a pedophile and start stating facts and evidence of it, and he could show that it's hurt his ability to raise money for Tesla, and he filed legal action against this podcast, 
[P142]  I think we would be in a world of hurt, and that legal liability is warranted. But the most powerful media companies in the world have Section 230 protection, so they have a business model where conspiracy theory or novel content, which is Latin for bullshit and lies, and the more angry it is, it gets elevated beyond its organic reach. So while I'm kind of down with the notion that we should have free speech and anybody should be able to say pretty much whatever they want, 
[P143]  There's something wrong when we have algorithms that have a profit incentive around rage, conspiracy theory, and lies, and two-thirds of Republicans believe that the election was stolen, when one in five Americans think that 9-11 was an inside job. Let's be honest. They thought that before the internet. I remember watching all the 9-11 truth of movies and all of that. But your point overall is right. I totally agree. 
[P144]  Wait, Elon agrees with you. When he bought X, he talked about the bot problem. He talked about the amplification of outrage. He hasn't done as much as I hoped he would have done so far, but I hope that they do address that because that isn't an Elon or an X problem. It's a technology problem of the modern world. The reality is that the more we live our lives online, the more you're going to have the problem of the ability of foreign governments, of individual people to create fake accounts, 
[P145]  bot farms, et cetera, to influence the way we look at all of these things. And we are going to have to come to terms with that reality because it's a technological issue that we're going to have to solve for and we haven't yet. It's also very easy for people to get caught in their own bubbles as well, which is a new phenomenon. There was a time where if you believed crazy things, you still had to sit next to someone else in church and talk to them about their life and what they believe. And you encountered dissenting voices. 
[P146]  encountered sane, rational people who had very different views to you that you had to be friends with long term. Whereas where we are right now is if you've got some sort of crazy view, you can find yourself only talking to people who share those views and only sharing content that reinforces those views until such time that you become extremely radicalized. I think that's such an important point because I think it's a real shame that AI LLMs aren't crawling the real world. I was at Granger's yesterday. Someone comes up to me. 
[P147]  Love your content. Let's take a picture. They're so nice. Another person comes up to me and says, I disagree with your view on this, but we have a civil conversation. And then I come home to 40 bots telling me I'm Professor Genocide. I mean, people in the real world, generally speaking, I don't know if it's because of the threat of physical violence, or they want to have sex with you, or maybe they think at some point you'll hire their kid, or generally just a comity of man. But people in real life, I find, are just lovely and wonderful. And it's a shame that these LLMs aren't calling this. 
[P148]  because the treif and some of the vile shit they're crawling online, which I don't even think reflects our species. I think it reflects technology that has a profit motive around promoting the most incendiary, hateful content. So there's got to be some sort of medium speed here. And also, I got off X, Steve, because you don't like Chick-fil-A, don't eat a Chick-fil-A. If Musk wants to pay $44 billion and turn it into a Nazi porn bar, that's his right. 
[P149]  illegal. I don't think the government should step in. But I don't have to paint his fence. And I can go to another platform. That's my right, too. And everyone says, oh, you're against free speech. I'm like, no, I'm not. I'm against being on a platform that makes me feel bad. So he has the right. And all this notion around meta, free speech, it's a little different because they control so much of the media. But these are media companies, and they should be liable for slander or defamation, the same way traditional media companies are in 
[P150]  I think we could solve a lot of this problem by just removing 230 protections for algorithmically elevated content. If you decide to elevate content beyond its organic reach, then you are making an editorial decision and you should be liable if that, in fact, is slanderous or defamatory. I think that's really fascinating as a way of handling it. And also, we're living in a world where, as of this year, some of the most phenomenal content you will read will be algorithmic. 
[P151]  generated and some of the most compelling content. So this idea that Scott's talking about, should bots have free speech? It sounds like a kind of, you know, intellectual kind of pseudo intellectual topic, but it's absolutely a very practical topic in the sense that bots now can generate conversations very easily. And some of the, you know, you could spend all day talking to a bot and not know. It's funny, this is this subject has come up because in the last week, I've had a flurry of messages on 
[P152]  WhatsApp from friends. I actually had two tweets yesterday, which you could probably see if you just search my name. Because on X at the moment, there's multiple ads running that are fake articles with fake BBC headlines with my face in. So it says things like, the Bank of England is suing Steve Bartlett. And this is running as a sponsored ad on X. And people are tweeting me these things. My friend says every time he refreshes the feed, he sees a new sponsored ad of a fake article of me. And sometimes it's like, can't believe this happened to Steve. And it's a BBC article. 
[P153]  you click on it, you get scammed. I think it's a crypto scam. I don't want to click. I'll send the link to you guys so you can click on it for me. But I just, it really has, because that is a bot. There's multiple of them, multiple accounts that have been spun up. They're all verified accounts. And it's AI generated imagery with a paid ad behind it. That's the bit that really gets me. I get people can post shit, but sponsoring it is a new level of defamation. One of the big macro things I've been thinking a lot about 
[P154]  haven't shared yet, is just the amount of social networks that have emerged. In the last 10 years, there's been a 50% increase so far in new social networks that have emerged. And we're seeing this splintering now of the rumbles, the blue skies, the threads. And it almost seems, talking about echo chambers, that social networks are becoming sort of political environments. And you're choosing your social network now based on your politics. This doesn't seem like a net positive thing for society. 
[P155]  argumentation of our reality. And it comes, you know, Scott's point about people behaving better in person is true. Although I would say there is the windscreen effect or the windshield effect, which is if someone cuts you up in traffic and you feel that there's some kind of physical separation between the two of you, most people behave slightly differently in that context than they would if they were sitting next to somebody face to face in a bar. So there's something about being physically present with other people that changes it, 
[P156]  one of the reasons, you know, I know you have pretty much all your interviews face to face and we do as well, because I generally speaking, it's very difficult to connect authentically with people. Obviously, we've managed to do it in the course of this conversation, but beyond that, it's difficult. And so we're going to have to work on that. But I just what the point I'm trying to make is this isn't a political issue. It's not an X issue. It's not an Elon Musk issue. It's a technological issue. We're living through 
[P157]  probably already have lived through most of the digital revolution. And I used to, as a kid, love Isaac Asimov science fiction books. And one of the reasons I did enjoy reading them so much is it was a world in which there was an exploration of what does the creation of robots, which is what we're living through, mean for morality? What does it mean for philosophy? What does it mean for humanity? What does it mean for, how do we build rules in a world 
[P158]  in which you have these machines that take every rule literally and suddenly you find that, you know, the desire to protect humanity results in the end of humanity. How do you navigate all of this? And that is what we're living through. We are also living through a period when our realities are being fragmented. And so we believe a very small set of things that other people like us somewhere in a very different part of the world, as Daniel was saying earlier, 
[P159]  believe, and we now live in this, we don't live in England or in Scotland or in America. We live almost like in a world of people who think like us in the West. And then other people live right next door to us who live in a whole different world because they consume a whole different set of information. That is the reality. We can complain about it. That is not going to change. And the only thing I really want to, 
[P160]  raise where I disagree with Scott about this idea that Facebook and X, et cetera, they are publishers and not platforms. I don't think you can apply the same media organization section to them. I don't think it's appropriate. They are platforms in which people publish information. The artificial amplification is a fair point. We need to deal with that. We need to deal with the bot problem. 
[P161]  That's a very difficult one because one of the challenges is the only way to really deal that I can see with the bot problem is to get people to verify their identity online. That obviously has a lot of questions around that because once you start forcing people to give their identity over to some anonymous blob online, who's collecting that data? What are they doing with it? 
[P162]  then the question for you is, well, you know, let's say right now I look at Twitter and I'm like, yeah, I'm happy to verify my identity. I'm happy to confirm who I am. Well, what if, you know, George Soros buys X off Elon at some point? Are you still happy that that information is being held? Are you still happy that the anonymous account you've now made confirmed? You know, what happens to the anonymous activists speaking about the Ayatollah's regime in Iran? 
[P163]  identity and the wrong person buys that platform or someone hacks it, et cetera. So it's a conversation that's not, if there were easier solutions on these issues, they would have been solved by now. This is a very difficult thing for humanity to navigate, and we're going to have to find a way to do it, and incrementally so. I just want to respond to that. I think you're guilty of the same illusion of complexity that protects these companies from acting like actors such that they can do anything regardless of the damage to the commonwealth to add shareholder value. 
[P164]  If you implemented, we have, first off, this notion that you don't want to give up your identity. Trust me, they know everything about you, Constantine, already. And I could go get a ton of information on you from the dark web fairly easily with a credit card. So the notion that somehow we shouldn't have some sort of, you could have, we need age verification for social media. There's no reason anyone in the age of 16 should be on a social media platform. And regarding the, 
[P165]  the civil rights activist or the women's rights activist that needs an anonymity, you could create a number of accounts and use blockchain or some sort of third-party anonymous to have a certain number of accounts that says, look, if you want an anonymous parody account, you want to make fun of people, fine. If you want an account talking about issues that you feel are sensitive from other markets, fine. We could absolutely figure that out and then figure out, okay, this account is doing nothing. It has no base. It has no soul. 
[P166]  values. It has 72 followers. All it's doing is trying to start fights online. All it's doing is trying to make people feel shitty about Britain or shitty about America. And the reality is these companies use that illusion of complexity such that they can have more bots creating more fake clicks, more Nissan ads, and more shareholder value. I think there's a middle ground here. I think we could figure this out. I agree. Well, that's what I'm saying. I think some of the ideas that you're putting forward, right or wrong, I don't know. 
[P167]  conversations we should be having. How do we make sure? I mean, my son is two and a half years old. And if my wife has become a complete screen Nazi, so he's probably not going to get a phone until he's about 40. But I think your point about people shouldn't be on social media. People shouldn't be on social media until they're 16. Absolutely correct. What that's doing to the minds of, well, or everybody, but particularly young people who are really susceptible to it. 
[P168]  The verification dimension is difficult, as I say. We're going to have to hash this all out as humanity. We're just going to have to work this all out. How do we live in this new world that we now live in? It's going to take some time. And I hope it's not as bad as the last time the information space was revolutionized, which was the printing press. That caused about two centuries of religious war. Hopefully we can avoid that. And part of the way to do that is to create environments which are uncensored, 
[P169]  People can express different ideas. We can have these battles and eventually come to some sort of mutual understanding. I hope that happens. What I wanted to ask you all to really close out this conversation was these conversations tend to be a bit of a reflection of what's in the news cycle and what's in the news cycle tends to be a reflection of what people are clicking. And a lot of that's driven by fear and the sort of narrative of the time, whether it's immigration or the Trump inauguration. But what is the big important idea that we're not talking about? 
[P170]  what's the most important thing that we should be talking about that isn't getting enough attention right now as it relates to the future of the West? And that's a big, broad question. I'll start with you, Daniel. For me, it's the schooling system. I think the schooling system is not preparing people for a world that exists and that we're teaching. You know, we haven't grasped the fact that AI is going to be the biggest, most disruptive technology in the lives of our children 
[P171]  into probably won't exist. We need to have a radical look at this idea that children should go to school with the same age groups or study a certain set of topics or that it should be topic-based at all. We need to explore, you know, are there better models for the schooling system that prepare people for the world that we're going to be in? Our current schooling system goes back to the early 1800s. 
[P172]  military schooling system in Prussia. And that's kind of where it evolved from. I think what we need to do is think about what are the, you know, what are the skills that our kids are going to need? I see too. And I can only, I don't feel like I can wrap my arms around UK's issues, but in terms of the US political extremism, I would put it number two, you know, at negative 40 Celsius and Fahrenheit meet. And because of our electoral system and Citizens United, people from the far left who are crazy and people from the 
[P173]  right who are crazy are just overrepresented. And they come together to meet on reckless spending, deficit spending. They come together to agree on anti-Semitism. And there's just too many people on the far left and the far right. And the people in the middle, it's minority rule. They're just not represented. However, I think the biggest threat that people aren't talking about, and I've actually spent some time talking with the administration around this, or the former administration, I should say, is loneliness. And that is, you have the deepest pocketed, most well-resourced 
[P174]  companies and people in the world trying to convince people, especially young men, that they can have a reasonable facsimile of life on a screen with an algorithm. And I think they literally go crazy. I think they wake up and they're obese and lonely and have no skills. We talked about this. I think young people, I say this jokingly, but seriously, I think young people need to get out of the house more, drink more, make a series of bad decisions that might pay off. I think we need more sex. I think we need more people in third spaces. 
[P175]  more church, more religious, more institutions, national service. We're mammals. And I worry that we're, one in seven men doesn't have a single friend. One in four men can't name a best friend. So this loneliness epidemic where people get into a bubble and start engaging in conspiracy theory, not trusting each other, blaming women, blaming the nation, self-harm. I just, I worry about, you know, when I say to young men, I coach a lot of young men, 
[P176]  15 minutes for a reason. This shit is hard and it's worth it. But I worry that we're raising, like I said, this new species of asocial, asexual being called the young American male that is obese, anxious, and just a shitty citizen. Constantine, the most important thing in 2025 that's not getting enough attention? In the UK and in most of Europe, it's an issue that Daniel raised earlier, which is in the UK, our energy prices are four times what they are in the United States. 
[P177]  That is an ideological decision. It's done because we're saving the planet. That's what we're being told. The reality is our contribution to global carbon emissions is we're responsible for 2% of global carbon emissions in the world. Making British pensioners freeze to death every winter because they can't afford fuel bills is not the solution to climate change. And if you amplify that further, 
[P178]  making our economy uncompetitive, making Britain unable to generate wealth for itself and for its future is not the moral position. Net zero, which is the impoverishment of our society for ideological reasons, has been positioned as the moral cause where we're saving the planet, we're ending climate change. We're not doing any of that. All we're doing is virtue signaling and making our fellow citizens suffer. So what we should be talking about is how do we make energy cheap, again, 
[P179]  so that we can have a prosperous economy. And guess what? When people are prosperous, that's when they actually start being responsible about pollution, about throwing away things they don't need. And also, when you have money, that's when you can invest money in scientific research, which allows you to find cleaner, better forms of energy. That's what we should be doing. We should be making sure that we generate as much wealth for our fellow citizens as possible, because a lot of people are struggling. 
[P180]  deeply, deeply immoral to impoverish already poor pensioners in this country and to prevent businesses from hiring people and giving them jobs and opportunities, including the young men that Scott is talking about, because we are saving the planet and we're trying to keep little Greta happy. We're not doing any of that. We're not successful in that. We should stop pretending and we should do what Donald Trump said he plans to do, which is drill baby drill. We should be exploring and exploiting all the energy reserves 
[P181]  this country in order to create clean energy and better forms of energy for the future, as well as to improve the well-being of our fellow citizens. That's what we should be talking about a hell of a lot more than we are. You need cheap energy. You're right. It's what I would argue. I think it's going to be liquid, natural gas and nuclear. We haven't talked about AI. AI requires 10 times the energy. The AI query is a Google query. The choke point is energy. I would argue in the US, I think we'd benefit more from as opposed 
[P182]  The drill, baby, drill, build, baby, build. I think young people have seen housing prices just go crazy. There's a psychological benefit to household formation, forced savings. So I'm going to take your word because you're a very smart guy that Britain has implemented a series of policies. That energy stat you rolled out was incredible. But in the U.S., like I said, I don't want to say we're drowning in oil. There were more drilling permits issued under Biden. 
[P183]  than the previous Trump admitted. I mean, just to call Biden anti-energy or that somehow we have this massively overinflated energy prices, it's just not, that hasn't happened in the US. I would like, we need more homes in the US. And in the UK too. And Stephen, let me just, before you wrap up, fill the stats out a little bit more. Obviously, everyone understands that geopolitically we're in a pretty tense time and there's conflicts happening. 
[P184]  Britain is in a position now where we would struggle. You've got to remember British history. Britain is, Britannia rules the waves, right? The way that Britain has become a great nation throughout history is by having a powerful fleet. We would struggle to build warships now because we've closed down all our steelworks because we're green, right? It's insanity. And on every other issue to do with energy and industry, we have basically deliberately moved our production 
[P185]  facilities to other countries. Okay, great idea. Globalization, make things cheaper, ship things, but wonderful. Okay, what happened during COVID? What happened when suddenly the entire chains of production weren't quite operating the way that they normally do? Oh, China's suddenly hoarding all the masks. Interesting. So what do you think is going to happen when there's a war? Or they're just going to keep shipping the steel to us to make the battleships and the warplanes that we need to fight them? That's what you think is going to happen? This whole thing, this whole agenda is ideological, 
[P186]  And what Ed Miliband is about to do to this country when it comes to this issue needs to talk about way more. And it is about economic prosperity. It is about housing, because one of the reasons we don't build as much housing as we need to is, again, building housing produces emissions. And we don't want to be not green. So that's why people in their 30s and 40s are now living in flat shares for four people. We have got to let go of this obsession with net zero. We have got to build. We have got to drill. 
[P187]  We have got to produce energy and we have got to stop thinking that the moral thing to do is to make our poor citizens suffer in order that we feel good about saving the planet, which we're not even remotely saving by doing this. Guys, thank you so much for all of your perspective. One of the things I realised as you guys were talking is that you're all fathers and you're all fathers of boys, although you're fathers of boys at different ages. So I wanted to just give you all 30 seconds if you could. 
[P188]  self for this advice but based on everything that's happening in the world which can feel incredibly confusing especially to young people where we're getting a lot of our information from different echo chambers what is the advice that you would all give to your young boys that would best prepare them for the future in the next couple of years starting with you Dan yeah so I've got a six-year-old daughter a seven-year-old son and a 
[P189]  them for a world that's fast changing is difficult. We're taking the approach of a lot of general knowledge across a lot of things so that you can use AI to run deep in different topics. We're encouraging the kids to interact with supervised AI conversations and letting them know that that technology is available. We're also just focusing on some manual skills, like how to fix a boiler and how to saw through some wood. 
[P190]  you know, those kind of things. And also we're doing things like acting classes, being up on a stage and performing. So all of those kind of typical things. But to be honest, it is a point of anxiety in my life just thinking about what, you know, what the world looks like for, you know, 10 or 15 years from now that they're going to be going into. So if you get clear answers on this, I'm really open to learning. 
[P191]  For me, my son is two and a half, so it's a little bit early for this pep talk. But my message to him when he's old enough to hear it is going to be this. Your grandfather, your great-grandfather, my grandfather, was taken as a slave laborer from Soviet Ukraine to Nazi Germany. Your great-grandfather was born, your great-grandmother, rather, was born in the Soviet Gulag. Your great-grandmother lived through the German occupation 
[P192]  Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. You are not living in the worst time ever. You're surrounded by pussies. If you are a man and if you do your job and if you learn the skills that you need to do and if you pursue the things that you want to do with your life to the best of your ability, if you believe in yourself, if you believe that you're talented, if you actually achieve the things that you set your mind to, there's never been a better time in the history of humanity than now. You're surrounded mostly by people who feel sorry for themselves, 
[P193]  If you're not one of them, you're going to clean up. Young women are looking for a young man like you who's actually going to stand up for himself, who's actually going to go out there and achieve and be confident. Be that and you're going to clean up when it comes to finding the right partner for yourself. You're going to clean up when it comes to making money. You're going to clean up when it comes to your career. You're going to clean up on every front because the bar has never been lower. The bar has never been lower. So just go out and be a man and life is going to be great. 
[P194]  I'm older. I have 14 and 17 year old boys. And my observation is you can't tell them anything. The best you can do is you can try and model behavior for them. So I'm trying to be really kind to their mother. I'm trying to show them that, you know, if you're serious about having a good family, you got to be a generous, loving partner. I'm trying to be in great physical shape, which is getting harder and harder. I'm trying to be aggressive around them in terms of business. 
[P195]  business and trying to be kind. And what I do, I do talk to them about the concept of surplus value. I'm like, you're takers right now. You know, the UK school system, which is amazing, is investing a lot in you and you're giving almost nothing back. Me and your mother are loving you a lot more than you're loving us. You're just taking resources everywhere. You're a net negative. And you're crossing the manhood isn't sex or some religious ceremony. You're crossing the manhood is when 
[P196]  you are start creating surplus value. You're loving more people than you're absorbing. You're listening to more complaints than you are complaining. You're creating more revenue than you're absorbing. That's the notion. It's surplus value. And I have this trick called what a man does. And I've been doing this when they're kids. I'm like, guests show up. A man goes and gets their luggage and puts it in their room. A man is constantly scanning the table for empty water glasses. And I mean, one of the proudest moments I ever had was when I'm like, 
[P197]  my six-year-old boy who was all like 30 pounds got up and went over this gigantic pitcher of water at this table and like started like trying to pour other people's water and everyone had no idea what was going on here. You know, I do these things called what a man does. A man goes up to, a man asks a woman out for coffee. A man pays for women. I'm a sexist that way. I still have told my men, my son gave me this rap on, oh dad, you're so establishment. I'm like, do you ever want to have sex? 
[P198]  I'm like, then you need to pay. I mean, that's the bottom line. Anyways, but what I would say is I'm trying to model. I'm trying to model good behavior or be a good role model. But I agree with Constantine and Daniel. I think every day they have more potential to lead the most amazing life in history. I'm not a nihilist. I'm not a catastrophist. I think I have big problems. But given the blessings of the sons born to these, 
[P199]  men and future you know future sons that you'll have steven jesus it's good to be them there's just they have no excuse they should they should they should rock on they should have a wonderful life constantine scott daniel thank you so much for taking the time um at sort of short notice to talk about all these subjects it's incredibly wide-ranging conversation and you'll bring such an interesting hilarious nuanced perspective to these issues i'm glad that we can have these conversations and disagree in a respectful way that hopefully clarifies a lot of the confusion that i

主题：美国年轻男性社会问题分析

输入内容：
[P50]  it begins to occupy the place it should command, if you will. Constantine, I would ask the same question to you as well. Do you think the UK is a failing nation? And Scott describes self-inflicted wounds there. I've heard you speak of self-inflicted wounds when you talk more broadly about the West and what the West needs to do to turn itself around. And also just layering a third point on top of that, which is somewhat linked to this, is Elon Musk has taken a particular interest in the UK over the last month in particular. 
[P51]  started to describe it online, it seems, as a failing nation. What's your view? Well, I'm glad you asked me about Elon Musk, because the thing that I love most about the media having this massive meltdown about, oh, no, these Americans are interfering in our political... These are the same media commentators who are constantly banging on about American politics and saying, Donald Trump needs to do this, you need to vote for this. Like, all of this stuff is ridiculous. The reality is we download our culture, our politics, 
[P52]  almost everything from America, right? America has become what Britain used to be, which is the center of Western civilization. And my request and ask and begging of British people is, if we're going to download American culture and politics, let's at least take the good stuff instead of all this terrible woke shit that we downloaded from them, the DEI and all this other nonsense, and actually take the entrepreneurial spirit and all these other things that are really great about America, the optimism, 
[P53]  the positivity, the willingness to have a go, to take a risk, as Scott was talking about. So I wish we took more of that. And it speaks to your question about are we a failing nation? Look, I think it's a deliberately inflammatory question, which I don't want to kind of actually accept in that way. But what I think we should acknowledge is are we trending up or are we trending down? And when you talk about over 10,000 millionaires, 
[P54]  have left. I hear that through a normal British person's ear. And I worry that there's quite a lot of British people who will hear that and say, oh, good, all of these rich parasites have left. Because that's our attitude in the UK to a very large extent. We see wealthy people not as what they are, which is for the most part, not everybody, but for the most part, people who've created a tremendous amount of value for their fellow human beings. And as a result of that, 
[P55]  have been rewarded. We see them because we, you know, we have this history of the landed gentry. And so to us, a millionaire is someone who has these ill-gotten gains that they don't deserve, right? That is not really the world we live in. When I talk to wealthy people in this country and pretty much everywhere else, for the most part, especially in the Western world, these are people who've created something that has fundamentally helped other human beings do something better, do something easier, 
[P56]  products, cheaper, whatever it is. That's who the successful people really are. And we just need an attitude shift. That's what we should be downloading from America. What we should be saying inside our heads is this person is successful because they've helped other people. Great. How do we get more of those people into our country? And I'm afraid I'm telling you something that you know better than anyone, Stephen. If you don't have entrepreneurs in your country creating businesses and creating jobs, 
[P57]  eternity. We have to get smart, talented, driven people into our country instead of chasing them out. Dan, I know this is a subject that you're very passionate about, and Konstantin's articulated it really, really well. I've seen lots of your posts about this subject, Dan. What are you seeing? And is it true that the British attitude is a form of self-harm that's holding us back from our potential? There are definitely attitudinal factors, but you'll also get the most incredibly entrepreneurial people here in London. London is a melting pot for 
[P58]  creativity. You've got sitting in one city, you've got people who are phenomenal at media, finance, technology, entertainment, politics, defense, like all of this. Like if you take the best of LA and Washington and New York and Miami and kind of start moving it into one city, you know, you get elements of that in London. It's a very diverse city from that point of view, and it creates an entrepreneurial melting pot. The issue is taxes. Nobody wants to pay 
[P59]  60% of their income in taxes. And as soon as you hit, you know, in the US, you don't hit the top tax rate until you are six times the average wage. Here in the UK, it's two and a half times. So as soon as you're two and a half times the average wage, you're in real trouble. There are so many people in the UK who deliberately hold their income at £50,000 because after £50,000, you get taxed 40% of your income. So people just give up and they say, I'm not going, I know some 
[P60]  really smart, really talented people who could be earning a lot more and they refuse to pay the 40% rate. So they like keep everything small because they don't want to go from 20 to 40% at the 50 grand rate, which is crazy. And I've employed people who have said, can I have a day off a week rather than going over that threshold? So, you know, that's a huge issue, the tax issue. The company rate tax is high. The corporate capital gains rate is taxed very high. The VAT is high. 
[P61]  The council tax is high. All of these additional taxes just keep piling up. And then the other cost at the moment, if we want to have an AI economy, we need cheap electricity. One thing that Trump has committed to is really, really cheap energy. There is no such thing as a fast growth, high octane economy that has expensive energy. Cheap energy equals fast growth. And we have the most expensive energy in the world. 
[P62]  Scott, you look like a lot of thoughts are going through your head following those two comments. What are you thinking? 
[P63]  that we have a housing crisis and that the executive order should have been around that. Just going back to the U.S., and I'm curious of the same dynamics and whether Constantine and Daniel agree with us. I believe this, the election in the U.S. was supposed to be a referendum on women's rights. Women's rights did not show up. This was a referendum on young men, in my view. And that is, if you look at the two cohorts that swung most from blue to red versus 2020, two of the three cohorts, other than Latinos, 
[P64]  was people under the age of 30 who in the U.S. are 24% less wealthy than they were 40 years ago, people over the age of 70 or 72% wealthier. Our tax code is basically an attempt to shove money from the young to the old. And two, 45 to 64-year-old women who I would affectionately describe as their mother. And that is when your son's in the basement vaping and playing video games, and I think a lot about struggling young men, you don't give a flying fuck about territorial sovereignty in the Ukraine, or Ukraine, excuse me, or transgender rights. 
[P65]  is your kid isn't doing well. And 210 times a day, your kid's getting a notification that somebody he knows is on a Gulfstream or partying in St. Bart's and it's not him or her. And so we not only have young people not doing as well, this pornographic wealth is just shoved in their face. And you end up with, in my opinion, kind of a young, struggling young man. No group has fallen further faster in the world, I would argue, than young men in America. 
[P66]  a morgue in the United States and there's five people who died by suicide, four of them are men. One in three men under the age of 30 has a girlfriend. Two in three women under the age of 30 has a boyfriend. Why? You think that's mathematically impossible? Because women are dating older because they want more economically and emotionally viable men. There's one in five men live at home at the age of 30. One in three under the age of 25. They're not having sex. They're more obese. They're more depressed. When women don't have a relationship, they oftentimes channel that energy 
[P67]  into their professional lives. More single women own homes in the U.S. than single men. Women in urban areas under the age of 30 are making more money than men. When men don't have the guardrails of a relationship or a job or being in school, they pour that energy sometimes into unproductive things, misogyny, nationalism or extreme nationalism, conspiracy theory. In some, they become really shitty citizens. They become sequestered from society. So I'm worried in the U.S., our biggest threat is a new species of asexual. 
[P68]  asocial young men who are incredibly dangerous have opted out of America. 60% of 30-year-olds used to have one child in America, and that's 27%. So people, I think, in the U.S., and this is a genuine question. I don't know if it's the same problem here. Our tax policies have taken money from the young, stuffed them in the pockets of old people so Nana and Pop-Pop can upgrade from Carnival to Crystal Cruises. Meanwhile, young people can't afford education. They can't afford housing. 
[P69]  And we especially see this really acute emerging crisis among young men who are just opting out of America, who don't even want to try and date, don't even want to enroll in school, don't want to even try and get a job, just stick in their basements and go on Reddit or Discord, or why go try and shower or work out and get a relationship when you have you porn? Why get a job when you can trade stocks or crypto on Coinbase or Robinhood? 
[P70]  In my opinion, this is the most dangerous trend in America right now. It was almost like demonizing men for decades has consequences. I mean, this is what's been happening. Men are the root of all evil, the root of all evil, the root of all evil. Every advert is about, you know, the woman is strong and capable. The guy's pathetic. In every movie, the woman's kicking ass and the man is pathetic. This has been going on for decades. It's a cultural thing as well as an economic thing. 
[P71]  meaning and opportunity away from men. If you create an education system that punishes boys for being boys, if you create a society in which traditional masculine virtues become vices, then you will create exactly the sort of thing that Scott is talking about. It's a terrible thing that's been done. Having said that, my message is always the same to young men who I hope are listening, which is the answer to your problems is never going to be, as Scott says, porn and this and that. 
[P72]  the answer to your problems is going to take responsibility, go out and get a job or create a business and actually make your life better. No one's coming to save you. No one's coming to help you. There is no, the sort of programs that we have for women where we sort of go, well, you know, let's give them an opportunity here. None of that's happening for men. It's not going to happen because for evolutionary reasons, we just don't feel sorry for men the way that we do for women. That's a reality. I know it sucks, 
[P73]  men is going to be the answer that's always been the answer for men, which is for you to get off the sofa, to get off the couch and go out and actually do and create and build and find your own way through it. Even if you have to acknowledge that the society you live in has been conditioned for quite a long time to think that you're a piece of shit because you happen to have the genitalia that you do. Now, that I think is the harsh reality of it. And I think Scott is right to point this out as a problem. And I hope that we start to have 
[P74]  both in terms of economic policy, but in terms of also just the cultural conversations and the way we talk about these issues, we come back to something that human beings have known through the entire history of our species, which is men and women are both good and need to work together in order to thrive and succeed together, in order to have families, in order to have children, and in order for us to have healthy communities and healthy societies. You need healthy femininity and you need healthy masculinity, and they need to come together and work together.

主题：美国社会文化经济转型讨论

输入内容：
[P5]  It feels to me that the world is at a real moment of transition in many regards. So like social transition, cultural transition, economic transition. And I think the US has been a catalyst for all of that. So that's why I wanted to have this conversation today. We've got an American here, Scott. I think Scott's the only American here. We've got Constantine. We've got Daniel, who are two Brits, but spend a lot of time between America as well. And so I want to come to Scott first and ask Scott a question, which is a very big, broad question, 
[P6]  your perspective, Scott, you know, when I talk about this feeling of transition, that seems to be like almost inside my chest, that we're at a really historic moment. What is your analysis on this? What is the big picture here? What's happened over the last three, four, five, six, seven months? And how is that going to impact all of us around the world? Well, if you think of the US as setting the tone economically, and maybe even culturally for the West, there's definitely a reversion away from 
[P7]  people feel that quote-unquote wokeism, and I don't like to use that word, but I'll use it here, was this sort of overcorrection to systemic racism and that it began to cause more damage than it was or cause more problems than it was solving. And I think there's been a serious kind of lurch back, if you will, whether it's executive actions declaring the border, a state of emergency, stuff around saying that gender is a thing, 
[P8]  and female. And most of these issues, the actually American public supports, I would say on a more cynical level, America used to be a platform for prosperity, the protection of civil rights, the projection of women's rights and power and democracy abroad. And I would argue that it feels like a pretty quick transition to almost like a, you know, I call it a kleptocracy, but America has become a platform for 
[P9]  acquiring wealth and then leveraging that wealth as a means or a proxy of power. And the ultimate example of that was the launch of two meme coins, the Trump coin and the Melania coin, the day before the presidency, such that this conversation could have already or might happen this week. And I'll finish here. President Trump, it's Vlad. We're thinking about stabilizing our currency or trying to send the outflows of our reserves. 
[P10]  into the Trump coin, which, based on my economist estimation, would take the value of it to a $20 or $30 billion market cap, making you one of the wealthiest men in the world, Mr. Trump. And none of this would be disclosable or transparent. Also, in unrelated news, we'd really appreciate you seizing arms shipments to Ukraine. So I think we've gone kind of full kleptocracy is the way I would describe it. Are you optimistic, Scott? Well, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy.

[P90]  very best possible person for this job at the price I'm willing to pay. I don't care if they are purple, green, blue, white, whatever. It doesn't matter. What matters is, are we getting the best person for the job? And my concern about identity politics has always been that if we do not adopt that worldview, then what we will do is create a worldview in which we have different racial groups competing with each other on the basis of race. 
[P91]  very dangerous mix for a multi-ethnic society like ours, which is why I've been begging people to let go of this stupid idea of identity politics and to say, first and foremost, we are all Brits or we are all Americans. We have this umbrella identity under which we all operate and our personal ethnicity or sex or whatever is secondary to that and actually for the purposes of employment, for the purposes of college admission, et cetera, is irrelevant. 
[P92]  Yes, if there is disadvantage, if we grew up in a single-parent home with a low income, we may need some extra support there. If we had terrible schooling or our education was not good, we may need extra support. If there's certain things that make it easier for us because of the disadvantages we've had to fulfill our talent and potential, I am all for that. But what we've created so far, and that's why I'm delighted it's being eliminated, is an anti-meritocratic system which says, 
[P93]  We don't care what you bring to the workplace. We don't care whether you deserve this place or not. We don't care about the potential you have. Actually, we just needed an insert category tick box to fill this slot. And you filled it. It doesn't really matter that you're not doing your job very well because now we can say, you know, we're a diverse company. I don't care about that and we shouldn't care about that as a society. And thank God that's now gone. Yeah, I think the worst part about it too is that it calls into question 
[P94]  and they're from a diverse background, you know, it calls into question why they got that job in the first place, which I think is horrible. You know, I just hired from two candidates, the final two candidates was a guy and a woman. I would hate if the woman felt that she got the job because she's a woman and not because she's best. She turns out she was by far the best in the process. And I would love for her to know that there was absolutely nothing that changed our view. 
[P95]  We weren't trying to fill a position with a woman. We were trying to fill the position with the best, and she should know she was the best. I think the contrast that was really fascinating was between Trump's website and the Democrats' website. So in the Democrats' website, it was who we're for, which was what Scott was saying. But Trump's website was the 20 things we're going to do, and it was just a list of 20. These are the 20 action points. This is what we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this. 
[P96]  as opposed to the identities that we want to advantage list. And I think that was the choice. You know, at the beginning, Constantine, you said, you know, America had a choice. And for me, when I looked at those two websites, I saw this choice between the identities being the main thing or the to-do list being the main thing and very different approaches. Scott, when I was listening to that Zuckerberg interview talking about masculinity and identity issues, one of the lines he said in there, 
[P97]  like something you've said on my show before, where he said, I think having a culture that celebrates that aggression a little bit more, talking about masculinity, has its own merits that are really positive. Now, Mark Zuckerberg isn't necessarily someone that I saw closely aligning to your worldview. Am I right in thinking that that's something you agree with? Because I remember you saying to me, you think people should be able to walk in a room and kick everyone's ass. What I've said on your show is that I think the male form, especially under the age of 30, 
[P98]  with its bone structure, incredible double-twitch muscle, and then this amazing, amazing chemical called testosterone, you're going to look back at your 25-year-old self and think, why wasn't I a fucking monster like Steve Barley? And also, there is some masculinity when Russian soldiers pour over the border in Ukraine. You want some of that big dick energy that Daniel was talking about. In the case of Zuckerberg, 
[P99]  I don't think he really understands an aspirational view of masculinity. I think when he couches immediately kind of trying to kiss Trump's ass because Trump threatened to put him in prison, and what he used to call moderation, he's now calling censorship. And when you have an algorithm that elevates incendiary hateful content, I would not describe that as masculinity. For me, masculinity comes down to protection, providing, and procreation. 
[P100]  Iадib Axel- He's about gendering a workplace in the context of trying to excuse a total elimination of what I would think is probably healthy moderation. I imagine Daniel and Constantine might have a different view. 
[P101]  Right now, when I talk about masculinity, you know, there's if I say at a conference, oh, women are better managers. Everyone goes, yes, that's right. That's right. Right. That's OK. If I say men are more risk aggressive and make better entrepreneurs, you're a misogynist. You're out. And the reality is men and women bring different attributes. But the masculinity and femininity, I think masculinity is a wonderful thing. I think we need a different image of it. I think people born as male have an easier time leaning into those things. 
[P102]  I work out at CrossFit with a bunch of lesbian firefighters. They bring great masculine energy, and they could carry my ass out of a fire. So a lot of men demonstrate wonderful feminine qualities. A lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculine qualities. I don't think these things are sequestered to anyone born as a specific gender. What I think, when I talk about masculinity, I don't talk about it in the role of corporations. I think that's as fraught with risk and not worth talking about. It should be about shareholder value or stakeholder value. 
[P103]  I think young men need a code. We're going to church less. We have fewer relationships. So what's the code you hold on to in terms of creating behaviors that are productive for you, yourself, society? And I think masculinity needs to be redefined as something more aspirational where you're celebrated for being really fucking strong. You're celebrated for not complaining. You're celebrated for creating surplus value. You create more tax revenue than you absorb. You're celebrated for being aggressive. You're celebrated for breaking up fights at bars.

输入内容：
[P43]  bullish on the UK versus the US from an entrepreneur's perspective? So the question I get most frequently when I speak here is to compare and contrast the US with the UK. And I use a personal anecdote. My parents immigrated to the US from Glasgow and London when they were 19 and 22. They took enormous risks. I've been an entrepreneur my whole life. I like to think that a lot of my success isn't my fault, that I inherited sort of that risk-taking DNA. And when I speak to people in the UK, I say the primary difference is 
[P44]  And that is, it kind of comes down to a risk appetite. The U.S. has five times per capita the number of entrepreneurs. It has five times the dollar volume per startup. There's $5 million in venture capital waiting to be deployed for every startup in the U.S. versus $1 million in Europe. I love what Constantine said about a restaurant. I went into this great little restaurant in Soho a few weeks ago called Dig In, and I loved it so much. I left my card and said, can you have the owner? 
[P45]  I'd like to open another one. Does he need money? I just would never do that here. I thought that was a really interesting insight. And the collision of risk, crazy ideas that occasionally become crazy genius and technology and intellectual property and great universities results in a company that no one had heard of five years ago being worth more than the entire UK stock market, NVIDIA. So there's just an enormous difference. 
[P46]  my impression of the UK economy, I'll just say London. I have no experience in it. I don't go anywhere that's not walking distance from Marlebone. So my bubble is pretty opaque. But the way I would describe the economy here is I love the term the butler economy. And that is all the money I see being made here is people servicing wealth created somewhere else. You're either in financial services servicing rich people. You're either opening a restaurant or hospitality. 
[P47]  quality servicing rich people, but I don't see a lot of organic wealth creation. I interviewed the two, quote unquote, inventors of AI at one of your prestigious universities. My first question is, how the hell were you not able to make any money if you invented AI? Why haven't you been able to capture any money? But just for your listeners, my summation of Europe versus the US after molesting the earth for the last 35 years is US is still the best place to make money and Europe is still the best place to spend it. Is this a failing nation, Scott? 
[P48]  I think you have too much going for you to be described as a failing nation. You still have amazing universities. London's still the second best city in the world. Premier League, it's an unbelievable export. I know how ridiculous that sounds. People want to be here. There's still rule of law, rule of play. You still produce amazing rock and roll. I just don't see how you could say this is a failed. I would argue that second only to our entry into Iraq, 
[P49]  An American can't understand why you would decide to increase your prices while reducing productivity in one fell swoop. It's difficult for us to wrap our heads around some of the economic decisions the UK has made. But I think a lot of people are kind of betting or hoping that the UK begins to grow again. So in a weird way, I would call myself cautiously optimistic about the UK. I think at some point it registers.

I think when we talk about Elon Musk taking risks, sending rockets that are captured by scissors coming down, inspiring the EV race, taking an enormous risk, making a shit ton of money. Yeah, that's a great form of masculinity. Accusing men trying to save high soccer players, calling them pedophiles, calling your employees a sex criminal such that they have to leave their house, having 13 kids by five women or three women, none of which you live with, 
[P109]  Sleeping next to a loaded gun, losing control of your self-control because of addiction. I don't think that's a great role model. I think it's an amazing role model for boys. I don't think it's a great role model for men. In terms of energy, there are so many reasons why I'm a big matcha fan, if you don't already know by now. And so much so that I actually invested in the UK's leading matcha company called Perfect Ted. And one of my favorite Perfect Ted products is these delicious matcha pouches that come in every flavor from salted caramel, 
[P110]  to peach flavor, to mint flavor, to berry flavor. One of my favorites is this vanilla flavor, which I'm going to make in just two seconds. You just take this mixer here, get a little bit of the powder, pop it on top of the shaker like that. Put the lid on. Shake, shake, shake. Delicious. If you haven't tried this yet, you can find Perfect Ted at Tesco and Holland Barrett stores or online where you can get 40% off with my code, Diary40. 
[P111]  put in code Diary40 to try this delicious multi-flavored matcha now. Highly recommend. And if you do it, please tag me, send me a message online. Do you know that 80% of New Year's resolutions fail by February? It's because we focus too much on the end goal and we forget the small daily actions that actually move us forward. Those actions that are easy to do are also easy not to do in life. It's easy to save a dollar, so it's also easy not to. Making one small improvement each day, one tiny step in the right direction, has a big difference over time. 
[P112]  mindset, which is why we created The 1% Diary, a 90-day journal designed to help you stay consistent and focus on the small wins and make real progress over time. It also gives you access to The 1% Community, a space where you can stay accountable, motivated, inspired, along with many others on the same journey. We launched The 1% Diary in November and it sold out. So now we're doing a second drop. Head to thediary.com to grab yours before it sells out again. I'll put the link below.

And if she's not interested and you're rejected, you're both going to be fine. You're celebrated for getting out of the house. You're celebrated for working. You're celebrated for making money and liking money. I think there just needs to be a redefinition of masculinity in the context of helping young men."

[P1] ﻿ The world is absolutely crazy right now. This is one of the most interesting moments of social, cultural and economic transition that I have ever seen. So I wanted to do something that I've never done before. I called upon three of the leading voices on social, cultural, business and economic issues to give their unfiltered, uncensored points of view so that we can all make sense of all of this craziness happening before our eyes. They don't always agree on much, but today they thrash it out to see if they can agree on something. 
[P2]  Go through the economy, Trump, Elon Musk, EEI, censorship, wokeism, and why so many men are struggling. Why are tens of thousands of millionaires running away from the UK? The terrifying truth and opportunity in AI. And I ask all of them, what is the most important thing in 2025 that nobody is talking about? With the aim of reaching clarity, agreement, and having a laugh in the process. This is the episode you probably didn't know you needed.

输入内容：
[P58]  creativity. You've got sitting in one city, you've got people who are phenomenal at media, finance, technology, entertainment, politics, defense, like all of this. Like if you take the best of LA and Washington and New York and Miami and kind of start moving it into one city, you know, you get elements of that in London. It's a very diverse city from that point of view, and it creates an entrepreneurial melting pot. The issue is taxes. Nobody wants to pay 
[P59]  60% of their income in taxes. And as soon as you hit, you know, in the US, you don't hit the top tax rate until you are six times the average wage. Here in the UK, it's two and a half times. So as soon as you're two and a half times the average wage, you're in real trouble. There are so many people in the UK who deliberately hold their income at £50,000 because after £50,000, you get taxed 40% of your income. So people just give up and they say, I'm not going, I know some 
[P60]  really smart, really talented people who could be earning a lot more and they refuse to pay the 40% rate. So they like keep everything small because they don't want to go from 20 to 40% at the 50 grand rate, which is crazy. And I've employed people who have said, can I have a day off a week rather than going over that threshold? So, you know, that's a huge issue, the tax issue. The company rate tax is high. The corporate capital gains rate is taxed very high. The VAT is high. 
[P61]  The council tax is high. All of these additional taxes just keep piling up. And then the other cost at the moment, if we want to have an AI economy, we need cheap electricity. One thing that Trump has committed to is really, really cheap energy. There is no such thing as a fast growth, high octane economy that has expensive energy. Cheap energy equals fast growth. And we have the most expensive energy in the world. 
[P62]  Scott, you look like a lot of thoughts are going through your head following those two comments. What are you thinking? 
[P63]  that we have a housing crisis and that the executive order should have been around that. Just going back to the U.S., and I'm curious of the same dynamics and whether Constantine and Daniel agree with us. I believe this, the election in the U.S. was supposed to be a referendum on women's rights. Women's rights did not show up. This was a referendum on young men, in my view. And that is, if you look at the two cohorts that swung most from blue to red versus 2020, two of the three cohorts, other than Latinos, 
[P64]  was people under the age of 30 who in the U.S. are 24% less wealthy than they were 40 years ago, people over the age of 70 or 72% wealthier. Our tax code is basically an attempt to shove money from the young to the old. And two, 45 to 64-year-old women who I would affectionately describe as their mother. And that is when your son's in the basement vaping and playing video games, and I think a lot about struggling young men, you don't give a flying fuck about territorial sovereignty in the Ukraine, or Ukraine, excuse me, or transgender rights. 
[P65]  is your kid isn't doing well. And 210 times a day, your kid's getting a notification that somebody he knows is on a Gulfstream or partying in St. Bart's and it's not him or her. And so we not only have young people not doing as well, this pornographic wealth is just shoved in their face. And you end up with, in my opinion, kind of a young, struggling young man. No group has fallen further faster in the world, I would argue, than young men in America. 
[P66]  a morgue in the United States and there's five people who died by suicide, four of them are men. One in three men under the age of 30 has a girlfriend. Two in three women under the age of 30 has a boyfriend. Why? You think that's mathematically impossible? Because women are dating older because they want more economically and emotionally viable men. There's one in five men live at home at the age of 30. One in three under the age of 25. They're not having sex. They're more obese. They're more depressed. When women don't have a relationship, they oftentimes channel that energy 
[P67]  into their professional lives. More single women own homes in the U.S. than single men. Women in urban areas under the age of 30 are making more money than men. When men don't have the guardrails of a relationship or a job or being in school, they pour that energy sometimes into unproductive things, misogyny, nationalism or extreme nationalism, conspiracy theory. In some, they become really shitty citizens. They become sequestered from society. So I'm worried in the U.S., our biggest threat is a new species of asexual. 
[P68]  asocial young men who are incredibly dangerous have opted out of America. 60% of 30-year-olds used to have one child in America, and that's 27%. So people, I think, in the U.S., and this is a genuine question. I don't know if it's the same problem here. Our tax policies have taken money from the young, stuffed them in the pockets of old people so Nana and Pop-Pop can upgrade from Carnival to Crystal Cruises. Meanwhile, young people can't afford education. They can't afford housing. 
[P69]  And we especially see this really acute emerging crisis among young men who are just opting out of America, who don't even want to try and date, don't even want to enroll in school, don't want to even try and get a job, just stick in their basements and go on Reddit or Discord, or why go try and shower or work out and get a relationship when you have you porn? Why get a job when you can trade stocks or crypto on Coinbase or Robinhood? 
[P70]  In my opinion, this is the most dangerous trend in America right now. It was almost like demonizing men for decades has consequences. I mean, this is what's been happening. Men are the root of all evil, the root of all evil, the root of all evil. Every advert is about, you know, the woman is strong and capable. The guy's pathetic. In every movie, the woman's kicking ass and the man is pathetic. This has been going on for decades. It's a cultural thing as well as an economic thing. 
[P71]  meaning and opportunity away from men. If you create an education system that punishes boys for being boys, if you create a society in which traditional masculine virtues become vices, then you will create exactly the sort of thing that Scott is talking about. It's a terrible thing that's been done. Having said that, my message is always the same to young men who I hope are listening, which is the answer to your problems is never going to be, as Scott says, porn and this and that. 
[P72]  the answer to your problems is going to take responsibility, go out and get a job or create a business and actually make your life better. No one's coming to save you. No one's coming to help you. There is no, the sort of programs that we have for women where we sort of go, well, you know, let's give them an opportunity here. None of that's happening for men. It's not going to happen because for evolutionary reasons, we just don't feel sorry for men the way that we do for women. That's a reality. I know it sucks, 
[P73]  men is going to be the answer that's always been the answer for men, which is for you to get off the sofa, to get off the couch and go out and actually do and create and build and find your own way through it. Even if you have to acknowledge that the society you live in has been conditioned for quite a long time to think that you're a piece of shit because you happen to have the genitalia that you do. Now, that I think is the harsh reality of it. And I think Scott is right to point this out as a problem. And I hope that we start to have 
[P74]  both in terms of economic policy, but in terms of also just the cultural conversations and the way we talk about these issues, we come back to something that human beings have known through the entire history of our species, which is men and women are both good and need to work together in order to thrive and succeed together, in order to have families, in order to have children, and in order for us to have healthy communities and healthy societies. You need healthy femininity and you need healthy masculinity, and they need to come together and work together.

[P20]  left lost its way in your view? And if so, how did that happen? And just to respond on some of Constantine's points about Trump being the best of a sort of right-wing collective, are we going to see right-wing sort of ideology spread throughout the Western world over the coming years? What's your take on all of the above? You definitely, you know, we Democrats, we get it right and then we just go too damn far. And so I look at, I'm a professor on a campus, 
[P21]  DEI, 60 years ago, there were 12 black people at Princeton, Yale, and Harvard combined. That was a problem. Race-based affirmative action makes sense. This year, more than half of Harvard's freshman class identifies as non-white. But 70% of those non-whites come from dual-income homes in the upper quintile of income-earning homes. The academic gap between black and white used to be double what it was between rich and poor. It's now flipped. So DEI was a good idea that, quite frankly, has gone insane 
[P22]  system it was trying to do away with. And then we created two candidates who were the only candidates who could make each other viable. Vice President Harris, given the hand she dealt with, did the best she did. I think President Biden should be buried in a crypt entitled narcissist who decided that it made sense for him to go back on his pledge to be a transition candidate and gave us a British-style election timing on the Democratic side in a marketplace. 
[P23]  or you need time and money. So it was not, we did not have a great candidate. There is an understandable swing back from what is an overcorrection around some of these issues. You know, parents, we gave them a huge issue with transgender rights. There's more Padel players in California than transgender people. And yet the Democrats decided to conflate it with the civil rights movement and think that it was okay for a woman who transitioned, a transgender woman, 
[P24]  enter a bicycle race and finish five minutes before everybody else, and then we all bark up the same tree and decide that it's inspiring. And parents all over the nation are saying, we've literally gone crazy. Where I would disagree a little bit with Constantine is that America choosing economic growth and prosperity, there are 190 sovereign nations in the world. 189 would change places with America over the last four years. We hit 71 new record highs in the markets, 97% of all AI. We've created more market capitalization 
[P25]  in a seven-mile radius of SFO International Airport than Europe's created in the last 20 years. We have the lowest inflation in the G7. We have the highest growth. We've grown 10% since 2020. That's triple the rate of Europe. Biden was unable to communicate any of that effectively because there's this psychological dynamic that when your wages go up, you credit your own grit and character, and when the price of cereal goes up, you blame the president. Now, similar to the future, or how William Gibson described the future, 
[P26]  It's here. It's just not evenly distributed. Prosperity is unprecedented in the U.S. over the last four years. It just wasn't evenly distributed. Now, having said that, in America, you can stop working in August and you've produced more and made more money than you have in Europe the whole year. And it has gotten better. It says things are less bad than anywhere in the world in the U.S. Biden was unable to communicate it. And then talking about how great the economy is when rents were skyrocketing, tuition was going up, it was an ineffective strategy. 
[P27]  But I don't think it's fair to say Americans chose prosperity. We have prosperity.

输入内容：
[P50]  it begins to occupy the place it should command, if you will. Constantine, I would ask the same question to you as well. Do you think the UK is a failing nation? And Scott describes self-inflicted wounds there. I've heard you speak of self-inflicted wounds when you talk more broadly about the West and what the West needs to do to turn itself around. And also just layering a third point on top of that, which is somewhat linked to this, is Elon Musk has taken a particular interest in the UK over the last month in particular. 
[P51]  started to describe it online, it seems, as a failing nation. What's your view? Well, I'm glad you asked me about Elon Musk, because the thing that I love most about the media having this massive meltdown about, oh, no, these Americans are interfering in our political... These are the same media commentators who are constantly banging on about American politics and saying, Donald Trump needs to do this, you need to vote for this. Like, all of this stuff is ridiculous. The reality is we download our culture, our politics, 
[P52]  almost everything from America, right? America has become what Britain used to be, which is the center of Western civilization. And my request and ask and begging of British people is, if we're going to download American culture and politics, let's at least take the good stuff instead of all this terrible woke shit that we downloaded from them, the DEI and all this other nonsense, and actually take the entrepreneurial spirit and all these other things that are really great about America, the optimism, 
[P53]  the positivity, the willingness to have a go, to take a risk, as Scott was talking about. So I wish we took more of that. And it speaks to your question about are we a failing nation? Look, I think it's a deliberately inflammatory question, which I don't want to kind of actually accept in that way. But what I think we should acknowledge is are we trending up or are we trending down? And when you talk about over 10,000 millionaires, 
[P54]  have left. I hear that through a normal British person's ear. And I worry that there's quite a lot of British people who will hear that and say, oh, good, all of these rich parasites have left. Because that's our attitude in the UK to a very large extent. We see wealthy people not as what they are, which is for the most part, not everybody, but for the most part, people who've created a tremendous amount of value for their fellow human beings. And as a result of that, 
[P55]  have been rewarded. We see them because we, you know, we have this history of the landed gentry. And so to us, a millionaire is someone who has these ill-gotten gains that they don't deserve, right? That is not really the world we live in. When I talk to wealthy people in this country and pretty much everywhere else, for the most part, especially in the Western world, these are people who've created something that has fundamentally helped other human beings do something better, do something easier, 
[P56]  products, cheaper, whatever it is. That's who the successful people really are. And we just need an attitude shift. That's what we should be downloading from America. What we should be saying inside our heads is this person is successful because they've helped other people. Great. How do we get more of those people into our country? And I'm afraid I'm telling you something that you know better than anyone, Stephen. If you don't have entrepreneurs in your country creating businesses and creating jobs, 
[P57]  eternity. We have to get smart, talented, driven people into our country instead of chasing them out. Dan, I know this is a subject that you're very passionate about, and Konstantin's articulated it really, really well. I've seen lots of your posts about this subject, Dan. What are you seeing? And is it true that the British attitude is a form of self-harm that's holding us back from our potential? There are definitely attitudinal factors, but you'll also get the most incredibly entrepreneurial people here in London. London is a melting pot for

[P75]  Together, that's what we're supposed to do. And these stupid gender wars and this idea that men as a group are this and women as a group are that, all of that just needs to end. I was watching last night as Trump sat there signing all of those executive orders. And I also watched his inauguration speak where he said, we will forge a society that is colourblind and merit-based. And he signed a bunch of executive orders last night to eliminate a variety of different DEI programmes in the federal government, 
[P76]  We've seen 
[P77]  whack DEI measures. So I think there's a lot of nuance here. I would argue in universities, DEI is used as a giant misdirect from people such as myself who are enforcers of the caste system and wake up every morning and look in the mirror and ask ourselves the same question. How do I increase my compensation while decreasing my accountability? And what I found is the ultimate strategy is to create an LVMH rejectionist bullshit, elitist strategy, where Dartmouth sits on a 
[P78]  endowment of $8 billion and lets in 500 kids. So the conversation around who gets in is a misdirect from the important question that is how many. If you are not growing your endowment or your freshman class faster than population, you should lose your tax-free status. We should be letting in more gay kids, more trans kids, more white Republicans from rural state. You know who doesn't talk about DEI? Junior colleges, because there's no admissions. They don't have a problem with DEI. 
[P79]  own tail, started out with the right idea. Now it's nothing. And I would argue the same is somewhat true of the Democratic Party. I went to the Democratic National Convention. On the dnc.org website, it lists 17 special introscripts, and it says explicitly who we serve, Asian Pacific Islanders, seniors, veterans, Black Americans, the disabled. It basically lists, I added this up, 76% of the population. And when you say you're actively advocating for 76% 
[P80]  of the population. You're not advocating for 76% of the population. You're discriminating against the 24%. It's gone too far. I would argue in the workplace, having served on seven public company boards, and I'm going to do a lot of boasting here because I'm desperate for all of your affirmation, and 12 private company boards, there's still work to be done in the private sector. There still is a cycle. 40% of all venture capitalists and probably 70% or 80% of all venture capital deployed 
[P81]  are white guys from just two universities, Stanford and Harvard. So I would argue universities, it's gotten out of control. I'd love to see the DEI apparatus disassembled, along with the ethics department, the sustainability department, the leadership department. These are all bullshit where we hire formerly important people with no standards. They never get fired. It just translates to more student debt. In the boardroom, in corporations, in certain sectors, I do think there is a need to be thoughtful about broadening the aperture of the lens 
[P82]  people who are underrepresented. There's still a dearth of women raising venture capital. So I think it's nuanced based on sector. But to just say all DEI is bad, I want to move to where the University of California did in 1997. They don't have race-based affirmative action. They have adversity-based affirmative action. I'm a beneficiary of affirmative action. I had something called Pell Grants. I was raised by a single immigrant mother who lived and died as secretary. So I got grants. I had 
[P83]  unfair advantage because I came from a household that was low income. And I think that there should be affirmative action. And I think it should be based on color, but that color is green. The poor need our help. The moment you start advocating for a special advantage based on any external factors, I think at this point in our society, it probably causes more problems than it solves. That's exactly right. That's exactly right, Stephen. 
[P84]  take a step back and look at why DEI has become such a big part of the conversation, it's precisely because instead of addressing the reality of people's lives, which is some people are disadvantaged and some people are advantaged, actually what we've mainly done, and Scott alluded to at the very beginning of our discussion, is we've given a leg up to very wealthy ethnic minority people from successful families, and they now, their children now get into 
[P85]  prestigious universities, which they probably would have done anyway, some of them, because they come from very advanced backgrounds. And the kids that are growing up in poverty, black and white, have no shot whatsoever. But the reason that it's become such a big issue around the Western world, actually, I don't think it's the nuances that we've delved into here, but actually something else, which is we have created the most ethnically diverse societies in history. And what I mean by that is, 
[P86]  not that we've created societies in which there are large groups of people who are different from each other, but for the first time probably in human history, we've created societies in which there is a lot of ethnic diversity and there is no overt discrimination against some groups of people in the sense of, you know, the imperial societies in the past would have had one dominant ethnic group, which is, you know, the Russians in the Soviet Union or the Turks in the Ottoman Empire 
[P87]  in the British Empire, whatever. That was the ethnic group that was like the dominant one. And everybody else was a kind of second-class citizen and everybody knew it, right? We don't have that anymore. We have highly diverse societies where people of every single background exist in which we have this idea that we're all supposed to be equal. And when we have programs that explicitly discriminate against people, there were times when the discrimination was explicit 
[P88]  black people. Well, we've gone full circle now where the discrimination was going the other way in university admissions, in hiring, in corporate America, in government, in all sorts of things. You know, in this country, the BBC has internships that aren't available to white people, etc. When you get to that point, as Scott said earlier on, everyone just goes, look, I know I'm not supposed to say this, but the reality is this is racism. This is a form of racism. And I thought we were trying to get away from the 
[P89]  So to the extent that the elimination of DEI is about creating a merit-based society in which people are given an opportunity because they're skilled and talented and they have the potential to actually achieve things and create wealth. You know, we all know this. We all employ people, right? How many of us are thinking about the races of the people we hire? I don't think we think about that at all. What we're thinking about is I run a business. I need the very best personable.

输入内容：
[P11]  I don't know if I'm just getting older, but no, I don't see a man convicted of sexual abuse or found liable who inspired an insurrection retaking the White House as a point of light for the American experience. Constantine, I suspect you'd have a slightly different view on all of the above. How are you feeling about everything that happened yesterday? Did you watch the inauguration? What is your big picture, 30,000 feet view? 
[P12]  make bold predictions about what's going to happen over the next six to seven months. I do think what America had at the election and what the election of Donald Trump represents is something that we in the UK don't have, which is choice. They had a very clear choice between two very different perspectives on the world, between two very different approaches, between two very different candidates. And ultimately, criticisms of President Trump are necessary and legitimate. Of course they are. 
[P13]  But at the end of the day, I believe having spent quite a lot of time in America around election time and also just generally and traveling around real America, not just in D.C. and L.A. and New York. The reason that he was elected was that the American people are not prepared to accept what Europeans have decided they're prepared to accept, which is managed decline. The American people do not want their country to become weaker. They do not want it to become poorer. 
[P14]  impoverish their fellow citizens through net zero. What they want is their country to be great, their country to be powerful, their country to be influential. The economic realities for most Americans are not really reflected in the figures that we are told. So when people talk about inflation, the reality of people's lives on the ground is that their cost of living has gone up very, very significantly over the last few years. 
[P15]  overall inflation figure that we're shown because certain things are much more influential in people's lives than others. And so whether the decision to elect President Trump ends up being this positive thing for which there should be lots of optimism is a matter of the next four years. Are we going to see a presidency that really does everything it promises? And by the way, you know, if you look at the things that Donald Trump is promising, 
[P16]  Whether you're left or right, you have to acknowledge that they are things that are worth doing. Having a secure border so that people don't come into your country illegally is a basic duty of government. Economic prosperity is a basic duty of government. Withdrawing America from a kind of simultaneously aggressive but weak posture around the world where America sort of says, yeah, yeah, we're going to get involved in these foreign conflicts, 
[P17]  win that war is a kind of stupid position on both whichever side you're on. So on all of these things, and of course, you know, Scott mentioned wokeness. I think he's absolutely right that there is a massive backlash happening around the world because lots and lots of people who were completely apolitical until the last three or four years or maybe until 2016 just feel like the world has gone crazy and suddenly they're supposed to pretend that men can change sex and become women and now they're 
[P18]  entitled to be in female prisons. And, you know, if your teenager says that they are the opposite sex, you're supposed to chop their breasts off and all of this other stuff that ordinary people just look at and go, this is crazy. Like, I am liberal, but this isn't liberal. This is some kind of weird thing that's going on. And I see the backlash against all of that all over the Western world. And I think Donald Trump signifies that people are fed up of that. 
[P19]  that if the woke left continues to exercise this level of influence on our public debate, the reaction will be the rise of the right. And Donald Trump is one of the most diplomatic and pleasant versions of what you're likely to get if the left keeps going crazy. We will see what challenges the world throws at him over the next four years and whether he's capable of responding to them.

主题：英国经济与企业家精神讨论

输入内容：
[P28]  My favorite appointment in the Trump administration in the adult room is the 10 year bond, which is going to say, sorry, girlfriend, when I believe the president tries to implement some of these economic policies. Constantine, is that true? Because what I heard there is that effectively Trump had a better marketing campaign. And that reality is somewhat different from what the Americans were sold in the last election cycle. Well, politics is about marketing and Trump is the marketer in chief. 
[P29]  and partly that's what politics is about. But in terms of the economy, I think Scott is entirely right. It's one of the reasons I admire America so much, the sense of dynamism and economic growth and the desire to create things and build things. It's an observation I've had every time I've been there. You know, if you have a successful restaurant in the UK, you go, well, I've got a successful restaurant. In America, if you have a successful restaurant, you open a second one and a third one and you create a chain, right? So their attitude to business more broadly is, 
[P30]  is fantastic and I love it. But I think the difference is that I don't think Americans were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the European economies. They were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the American economy under Donald Trump in his first term and also what they expect him to do for the future. When they look at the fact that he's got real business leaders in government now, like Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk talking about government efficiency, 
[P31]  all Western countries have a massively bloated civil service, what we call civil service in the UK and the administrative state in the US that wastes a huge amount of money, that produces very little in terms of output in many cases. And that needs to be slimmed down. And people, I think, are very excited about that. And when I talk to business leaders in America, including ones that were never on the Trump train, so to speak, so many of them went over to his side in this election cycle. 
[P32]  because they just felt that he was going to continue to accelerate American growth and continue to deliver prosperity for the American people. Now, Scott's point about tariffs and all of these other things, you know, I've listened to Donald Trump enough now to know that you should not necessarily be taking him literally. I think many of the things he says are negotiation tactics and signaling. 
[P33]  build this or do that or do this. You have to sort of read between the lines when he says, you know, this will be the worst thing that you just go. He's saying to people like, you better work with me. Otherwise, this is going to work out badly for you on all of these things. And so it remains to be seen whether he's successful in those tactics of getting what he wants. Look, America is always going to be an unequal society. It's designed in a way that is going to make it that way. In America, the focus is how do we grow the pie? 
[P34]  In Europe, the focus is how do we divide it up so everyone gets their fair little share, right? So Americans are about expanding the pie and then the people who bake the pie get as much of it as they possibly can. But the question is, can there be a sense in America that the American dream is alive, that you do not have to work three gig economy jobs to pay your rent, that you're going to be able to buy a house, that you're going to be able to afford to have children, 
[P35]  raise a family, perhaps on a single income, something that most people only dream about nowadays. That's really what this whole economic conversation is about. And we will see over the next four years if Donald Trump is able to slightly even change the direction of travel towards those things that actually Americans of my generation and older used to take for granted as the promise of the country that they live in. I've thought a lot about this over the last couple of weeks in particular, 
[P36]  papers in the UK that millionaires are leaving the UK in historic numbers. I think it's 10,800 millionaires left last year, which is an increase of about 160% versus the previous year. And the general sentiment in terms of business confidence in the UK is at a several year low. So I think it's the lowest it's been since just post pandemic. There's this, I think it's the Institute of Accountants, they call up 1000 accountants every year, and they get they run a survey to see how much confidence 
[P37]  they have in business in this country. And it's fallen 14 points to 0.2% confidence in terms of business. But there's this bigger narrative emerging amongst my entrepreneurial friends that if you want to start a business right now, the best place to be in the world is to be in America, is to get over to America and to leave the UK. Now, Dan, how does that score? I know you have an accelerator, you speak to lots of entrepreneurs. How does that sort of compare or contrast with what you're seeing at the moment? Yeah, 100%. The value proposition for the UK has dropped through the floor. 
[P38]  Very, very high tax. The ecosystem of business is in decline. Some of the smartest people are now in Dubai. Some incredible creators that I know have moved to Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai. Many are going to the USA. So if people are interested in bigger markets and bigger opportunities, they're into the USA. If they're interested in lower tax and more fringe opportunities, they're in the Middle East. 
[P39]  a place in the world. I think there are three business models the UK could go for, which is either the head office of Europe, which is what we were when we were inside the EU, and everyone used to come here to build a European business. We could be the back office of the USA, so the incubator for the USA. A lot of smart companies get to their first 50 million of value here in the UK and then sell to a US private equity firm or US listed company. 
[P40]  And a lot of US companies are now actually coming here to poach talent or to outsource things to the UK more cheaply than they could do it in the US. The wages in the UK are through the floor compared to what you would pay in the US, especially in tech roles. So very smart people in the UK are massively devalued. 
[P41]  tax, model of Dubai, Singapore, you know, those kind of options. So we haven't really picked one of those three yet. We're still, you know, all these years after Brexit, and we haven't said which of those three models we want to adopt. Scott, you moved here a couple of years ago to the UK. And despite everything that's going on in the UK, are you still bullish on this being a place for entrepreneurship and business? I was looking at some stats 
[P42]  of key areas of concern for me. Business stats I've talked about there, the drop in business confidence, the entrepreneur exodus that we're seeing, but things like knife crime in the UK are up 81% over the last decade, which I think is a symptom probably of something else. And one of the big things I think a lot about as an entrepreneur at the moment is artificial intelligence. And our investment in artificial intelligence from a global perspective is down about 2000% versus a country like America. So you've moved here, you've brought your family here.

主题：父亲对子女的未来建议

输入内容：
[P122]  by someone like Elon Musk on a platform like X, which is now free, to the point where Keir Starmer is forced into defensive action. I wish that was around 30 years ago because a hell of a lot of young girls and women wouldn't have suffered the way they did if we had the opportunity to get that message out. So, God, yes, it's a net positive. Just to pick up on that, Constantine, I've had a question in my mind for a while regarding the scandal, which is horrific, I think it's something we all definitely agree on, is why has Elon chosen 
[P123]  now? And why has he chosen Keir Starmer as the sort of central target of this flurry of tweets around the grooming scandals? Because there's clearly, Elon's, I think, an individual which you can kind of see thinking in real time. Like if you go back through his tweets, because there's so many of them, and they kind of come in these spurts, you can almost see what he's getting at. Is there an underlying reason why he's made this a central issue over the last couple of weeks? 
[P124]  is actually most Americans were completely unaware of this issue until recently. I remember a year ago speaking at a private event in New York and somebody said to me, well, you know, what is the consequence of political correctness? Why are you so against it? Why are you so against censorship? And I talked about the grooming gangs and people were horrified. They hadn't even, and these are well-informed, educated people who are media savvy and whatever. So one of the reasons is I think to a lot of Americans, this issue is only coming to the fore. 
[P125]  now in front of their mind. The second issue, I think, is that Elon Musk understands what I said earlier, which is we have a global Western culture now. And so what happens in Britain matters just as much as what happens in America, because we are symbiotic with each other now. When there's a restriction of speech in the UK, when we have laws about what people are not allowed to say, that has an impact across the world. When you see the European Union trying to pass legislation, 
[P126]  about online censorship. That has an impact because if something exists in the UK and in many European countries, it's only a matter of time before people in America are going to say, well, look, they've got this in Europe. Why don't we bring it over here? And vice versa. So what happens in America affects us in Europe and in the UK. And what happens in Europe and the UK affects America. So what Elon, I think, is trying to do is to say, we care about our civilization. Elon doesn't really talk that much about the United States. 
[P127]  about our civilization as I do, because I believe that we are now one thing to a very significant extent. Now, from our civilizational point of view, is it a good thing that mass rape gangs in the UK are being insufficiently investigated and treated improperly by the police and the government? No, it's not. It's a very bad thing. So how do we address that? Well, we address that by putting pressure on the government of the day. Now, I don't see the grooming gangs as a party political issue. 
[P128]  it properly, although there were individual members of the cabinet that tried to do something like Sir Le Braverman. But he's putting pressure on the government of the day. You can see him going after Nigel Farage, of all people, and saying Nigel Farage is not the right leader for reform. So he's attempting to shape British politics in the direction that he feels is the right way. What does he want? What outcome does he want? Look, I don't know what Elon Musk wants. I don't know him personally. I haven't even yet had a chance 
[P129]  to interview him, which I really look forward to doing, because I think he's one of the great visionaries of our time. Whether you like him or not, I think that's undeniably true. But my sense is he's trying to talk about all the things that we've been discussing, freedom of expression, the end of identity politics and the pursuit of meritocracy, a pioneering, inspiring vision of the future, which is why he's talking about Mars and a vision for our civilization that goes beyond the narrow squabbling 
[P130]  here on Earth. And the understanding that human beings are meant, we left the cave. We're not supposed to stay in a place with the walls closing in on us and feel like we're in decline. We're not supposed to be a civilization that has 1.5 children per woman and that is simply just leaving the planet Earth because we can't reproduce. We're supposed to look at the future with hope and optimism. We're supposed to say,

主题：能源政策与经济发展关系

输入内容：
[P113]  Censorship. The word censorship was used there by Scott. We've seen this reversal in Meta's attitude, Facebook's attitude that had been built up over a decade, where it almost felt like if you had sort of right-leaning views or really any unaccepted views and you posted those on Facebook, you would face maybe having the post deleted or your account suspended. This new world of speech, of free speech, and as it pertains to masculinity. 
[P114]  noticed, Scott, you'd left X. You no longer post or tweet on X anymore. Do you think Elon's decision to buy X is a net positive for society? Net, yes. But I think what people hear when you say that is there's no problems with this system than, you know, compared to the ones we had before. There are definitely disadvantages to a free platform like X now. And one of them is 
[P115]  inevitably when you remove censorship, one of the things the censorship was doing was keeping all the deeply unpleasant people away from being able to shove things in your face. And that happens quite a lot on it. So I don't enjoy that aspect of it. But I've always said that would be the price that we would pay for freedom. Freedom always has a price, and that's what we're seeing. As for Zuckerberg, his miraculous transformation into a free speech warrior 
[P116]  And I'm delighted to welcome him. I'm sure it's entirely genuine and not anything to do with the election results we've just seen in any way whatsoever. And the fact that the culture shifted and those of us who were being censored by people like him for years actually winning the argument. Well, what it shows you is we've won the argument on free speech when it comes to the big tech platforms. And it's going to be messy. 
[P117]  that are algorithmically driven, where the truth and the moderate reasonable take is not what usually gets attention, you're going to see a lot of unpleasantness. I value the ability to hear and communicate truthful ideas and facts over my own subjective feelings. Oh, someone said a thing I don't like or someone was racist or someone was misogynistic. I don't enjoy the fact that that happens. 
[P118]  but I would rather that happened and also we were not being censored from saying, you know, COVID probably came from a lab in China, which we were. You know, the Hunter Biden laptop story isn't Russian disinformation. Actually, it's an important piece of information that American voters need to hear when they're making their decision about the election. And all of these other things that were being suppressed and censored across social media for years, they're not anymore. 
[P119]  that's a good thing. And I think that's helpful. And if you look at, you know, to bring it back to the UK for a moment, Stephen, as you know, on Trigonometry, we've tried to cover the grooming gangs scandal and is an outrage what happened in this country over decades. We've been covering that for years, since about 2019, 2020, to very little purchase. And one of the reasons is it was just something that the media sort of covered and then moved on, when it actually should have been something we talked about on 
[P120]  daily basis until serious action was taken. And we saw real, real change, real change in policing, real change in social work, real change in government, real change in the way that these racially aggravated hate crimes were treated. Well, none of that was really being talked about seriously until Elon kicked up a fuss, amplified the voices of survivors, amplified the voices of campaigners on X, which he bought. And now the British government is forced 
[P121]  to do whatever it can to actually address those issues to the extent that it will. A lot of people will say it still doesn't go far enough. Well, if it doesn't go far enough, we now have a platform from which we can continue to have that conversation until there is the sort of inquiry and the sort of outcomes that people want to actually deliver real change. So is that a positive? God, yes. God, yes. We needed that.

输入内容：
[P1] ﻿ The world is absolutely crazy right now. This is one of the most interesting moments of social, cultural and economic transition that I have ever seen. So I wanted to do something that I've never done before. I called upon three of the leading voices on social, cultural, business and economic issues to give their unfiltered, uncensored points of view so that we can all make sense of all of this craziness happening before our eyes. They don't always agree on much, but today they thrash it out to see if they can agree on something. 

[P5]  It feels to me that the world is at a real moment of transition in many regards. So like social transition, cultural transition, economic transition. And I think the US has been a catalyst for all of that. So that's why I wanted to have this conversation today. We've got an American here, Scott. I think Scott's the only American here. We've got Constantine. We've got Daniel, who are two Brits, but spend a lot of time between America as well. And so I want to come to Scott first and ask Scott a question, which is a very big, broad question, 

[P6]  your perspective, Scott, you know, when I talk about this feeling of transition, that seems to be like almost inside my chest, that we're at a really historic moment. What is your analysis on this? What is the big picture here? What's happened over the last three, four, five, six, seven months? And how is that going to impact all of us around the world? Well, if you think of the US as setting the tone economically, and maybe even culturally for the West, there's definitely a reversion away from

[P177]  That is an ideological decision. It's done because we're saving the planet. That's what we're being told. The reality is our contribution to global carbon emissions is we're responsible for 2% of global carbon emissions in the world. Making British pensioners freeze to death every winter because they can't afford fuel bills is not the solution to climate change. And if you amplify that further, 

[P180]  deeply, deeply immoral to impoverish already poor pensioners in this country and to prevent businesses from hiring people and giving them jobs and opportunities, including the young men that Scott is talking about, because we are saving the planet and we're trying to keep little Greta happy. We're not doing any of that. We're not successful in that. We should stop pretending and we should do what Donald Trump said he plans to do, which is drill baby drill. We should be exploring and exploiting all the energy reserves 

[P183]  than the previous Trump admitted. I mean, just to call Biden anti-energy or that somehow we have this massively overinflated energy prices, it's just not, that hasn't happened in the US. I would like, we need more homes in the US. And in the UK too. And Stephen, let me just, before you wrap up, fill the stats out a little bit more. Obviously, everyone understands that geopolitically we're in a pretty tense time and there's conflicts happening. 

[P186]  And what Ed Miliband is about to do to this country when it comes to this issue needs to talk about way more. And it is about economic prosperity. It is about housing, because one of the reasons we don't build as much housing as we need to is, again, building housing produces emissions. And we don't want to be not green. So that's why people in their 30s and 40s are now living in flat shares for four people. We have got to let go of this obsession with net zero. We have got to build. We have got to drill. 

[P189]  them for a world that's fast changing is difficult. We're taking the approach of a lot of general knowledge across a lot of things so that you can use AI to run deep in different topics. We're encouraging the kids to interact with supervised AI conversations and letting them know that that technology is available. We're also just focusing on some manual skills, like how to fix a boiler and how to saw through some wood. 

[P192]  Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. You are not living in the worst time ever. You're surrounded by pussies. If you are a man and if you do your job and if you learn the skills that you need to do and if you pursue the things that you want to do with your life to the best of your ability, if you believe in yourself, if you believe that you're talented, if you actually achieve the things that you set your mind to, there's never been a better time in the history of humanity than now. You're surrounded mostly by people who feel sorry for themselves, 

[P195]  business and trying to be kind. And what I do, I do talk to them about the concept of surplus value. I'm like, you're takers right now. You know, the UK school system, which is amazing, is investing a lot in you and you're giving almost nothing back. Me and your mother are loving you a lot more than you're loving us. You're just taking resources everywhere. You're a net negative. And you're crossing the manhood isn't sex or some religious ceremony. You're crossing the manhood is when 

[P198]  I'm like, then you need to pay. I mean, that's the bottom line. Anyways, but what I would say is I'm trying to model. I'm trying to model good behavior or be a good role model. But I agree with Constantine and Daniel. I think every day they have more potential to lead the most amazing life in history. I'm not a nihilist. I'm not a catastrophist. I think I have big problems. But given the blessings of the sons born to these,

[P188]  self for this advice but based on everything that's happening in the world which can feel incredibly confusing especially to young people where we're getting a lot of our information from different echo chambers what is the advice that you would all give to your young boys that would best prepare them for the future in the next couple of years starting with you Dan yeah so I've got a six-year-old daughter a seven-year-old son and a 

[P191]  For me, my son is two and a half, so it's a little bit early for this pep talk. But my message to him when he's old enough to hear it is going to be this. Your grandfather, your great-grandfather, my grandfather, was taken as a slave laborer from Soviet Ukraine to Nazi Germany. Your great-grandfather was born, your great-grandmother, rather, was born in the Soviet Gulag. Your great-grandmother lived through the German occupation 

[P194]  I'm older. I have 14 and 17 year old boys. And my observation is you can't tell them anything. The best you can do is you can try and model behavior for them. So I'm trying to be really kind to their mother. I'm trying to show them that, you know, if you're serious about having a good family, you got to be a generous, loving partner. I'm trying to be in great physical shape, which is getting harder and harder. I'm trying to be aggressive around them in terms of business. 

[P197]  my six-year-old boy who was all like 30 pounds got up and went over this gigantic pitcher of water at this table and like started like trying to pour other people's water and everyone had no idea what was going on here. You know, I do these things called what a man does. A man goes up to, a man asks a woman out for coffee. A man pays for women. I'm a sexist that way. I still have told my men, my son gave me this rap on, oh dad, you're so establishment. I'm like, do you ever want to have sex? 

[P200]  experience and a lot of people are experiencing at the moment so thank you to all of you i'm going to link to all of your work on the screen i know scott you've got a book coming on masculinity which we're all very very excited about we've been waiting it's long overdue please hurry up um constantine you've got an incredible podcast with trigonometry which i'm going to link on the screen and i suggest everybody goes and listens to and subscribes to if they're looking for more of this stuff and daniel you've just been on my show already but your endless amount of books and i think the best place to get more from you is your website of course uh your the daniel priestly website where you can find all of your books and all of your work and everything you're doing there

[P169]  People can express different ideas. We can have these battles and eventually come to some sort of mutual understanding. I hope that happens. What I wanted to ask you all to really close out this conversation was these conversations tend to be a bit of a reflection of what's in the news cycle and what's in the news cycle tends to be a reflection of what people are clicking. And a lot of that's driven by fear and the sort of narrative of the time, whether it's immigration or the Trump inauguration. But what is the big important idea that we're not talking about? 

[P172]  military schooling system in Prussia. And that's kind of where it evolved from. I think what we need to do is think about what are the, you know, what are the skills that our kids are going to need? I see too. And I can only, I don't feel like I can wrap my arms around UK's issues, but in terms of the US political extremism, I would put it number two, you know, at negative 40 Celsius and Fahrenheit meet. And because of our electoral system and Citizens United, people from the far left who are crazy and people from the 

[P175]  more church, more religious, more institutions, national service. We're mammals. And I worry that we're, one in seven men doesn't have a single friend. One in four men can't name a best friend. So this loneliness epidemic where people get into a bubble and start engaging in conspiracy theory, not trusting each other, blaming women, blaming the nation, self-harm. I just, I worry about, you know, when I say to young men, I coach a lot of young men, 

[P178]  making our economy uncompetitive, making Britain unable to generate wealth for itself and for its future is not the moral position. Net zero, which is the impoverishment of our society for ideological reasons, has been positioned as the moral cause where we're saving the planet, we're ending climate change. We're not doing any of that. All we're doing is virtue signaling and making our fellow citizens suffer. So what we should be talking about is how do we make energy cheap, again, 

[P181]  this country in order to create clean energy and better forms of energy for the future, as well as to improve the well-being of our fellow citizens. That's what we should be talking about a hell of a lot more than we are. You need cheap energy. You're right. It's what I would argue. I think it's going to be liquid, natural gas and nuclear. We haven't talked about AI. AI requires 10 times the energy. The AI query is a Google query. The choke point is energy. I would argue in the US, I think we'd benefit more from as opposed 

[P184]  Britain is in a position now where we would struggle. You've got to remember British history. Britain is, Britannia rules the waves, right? The way that Britain has become a great nation throughout history is by having a powerful fleet. We would struggle to build warships now because we've closed down all our steelworks because we're green, right? It's insanity. And on every other issue to do with energy and industry, we have basically deliberately moved our production 

[P187]  We have got to produce energy and we have got to stop thinking that the moral thing to do is to make our poor citizens suffer in order that we feel good about saving the planet, which we're not even remotely saving by doing this. Guys, thank you so much for all of your perspective. One of the things I realised as you guys were talking is that you're all fathers and you're all fathers of boys, although you're fathers of boys at different ages. So I wanted to just give you all 30 seconds if you could. 

[P190]  you know, those kind of things. And also we're doing things like acting classes, being up on a stage and performing. So all of those kind of typical things. But to be honest, it is a point of anxiety in my life just thinking about what, you know, what the world looks like for, you know, 10 or 15 years from now that they're going to be going into. So if you get clear answers on this, I'm really open to learning. 

[P193]  If you're not one of them, you're going to clean up. Young women are looking for a young man like you who's actually going to stand up for himself, who's actually going to go out there and achieve and be confident. Be that and you're going to clean up when it comes to finding the right partner for yourself. You're going to clean up when it comes to making money. You're going to clean up when it comes to your career. You're going to clean up on every front because the bar has never been lower. The bar has never been lower. So just go out and be a man and life is going to be great. 

[P196]  you are start creating surplus value. You're loving more people than you're absorbing. You're listening to more complaints than you are complaining. You're creating more revenue than you're absorbing. That's the notion. It's surplus value. And I have this trick called what a man does. And I've been doing this when they're kids. I'm like, guests show up. A man goes and gets their luggage and puts it in their room. A man is constantly scanning the table for empty water glasses. And I mean, one of the proudest moments I ever had was when I'm like, 

[P199]  men and future you know future sons that you'll have steven jesus it's good to be them there's just they have no excuse they should they should they should rock on they should have a wonderful life constantine scott daniel thank you so much for taking the time um at sort of short notice to talk about all these subjects it's incredibly wide-ranging conversation and you'll bring such an interesting hilarious nuanced perspective to these issues i'm glad that we can have these conversations and disagree in a respectful way that hopefully clarifies a lot of the confusion that i

主题：男性危机与社会角色探讨

输入内容：
[P63]  that we have a housing crisis and that the executive order should have been around that. Just going back to the U.S., and I'm curious of the same dynamics and whether Constantine and Daniel agree with us. I believe this, the election in the U.S. was supposed to be a referendum on women's rights. Women's rights did not show up. This was a referendum on young men, in my view. And that is, if you look at the two cohorts that swung most from blue to red versus 2020, two of the three cohorts, other than Latinos, 

[P66]  a morgue in the United States and there's five people who died by suicide, four of them are men. One in three men under the age of 30 has a girlfriend. Two in three women under the age of 30 has a boyfriend. Why? You think that's mathematically impossible? Because women are dating older because they want more economically and emotionally viable men. There's one in five men live at home at the age of 30. One in three under the age of 25. They're not having sex. They're more obese. They're more depressed. When women don't have a relationship, they oftentimes channel that energy 

[P69]  And we especially see this really acute emerging crisis among young men who are just opting out of America, who don't even want to try and date, don't even want to enroll in school, don't want to even try and get a job, just stick in their basements and go on Reddit or Discord, or why go try and shower or work out and get a relationship when you have you porn? Why get a job when you can trade stocks or crypto on Coinbase or Robinhood? 

[P72]  the answer to your problems is going to take responsibility, go out and get a job or create a business and actually make your life better. No one's coming to save you. No one's coming to help you. There is no, the sort of programs that we have for women where we sort of go, well, you know, let's give them an opportunity here. None of that's happening for men. It's not going to happen because for evolutionary reasons, we just don't feel sorry for men the way that we do for women. That's a reality. I know it sucks, 

[P75]  Together, that's what we're supposed to do. And these stupid gender wars and this idea that men as a group are this and women as a group are that, all of that just needs to end. I was watching last night as Trump sat there signing all of those executive orders. And I also watched his inauguration speak where he said, we will forge a society that is colourblind and merit-based. And he signed a bunch of executive orders last night to eliminate a variety of different DEI programmes in the federal government, 

[P78]  endowment of $8 billion and lets in 500 kids. So the conversation around who gets in is a misdirect from the important question that is how many. If you are not growing your endowment or your freshman class faster than population, you should lose your tax-free status. We should be letting in more gay kids, more trans kids, more white Republicans from rural state. You know who doesn't talk about DEI? Junior colleges, because there's no admissions. They don't have a problem with DEI. 

[P81]  are white guys from just two universities, Stanford and Harvard. So I would argue universities, it's gotten out of control. I'd love to see the DEI apparatus disassembled, along with the ethics department, the sustainability department, the leadership department. These are all bullshit where we hire formerly important people with no standards. They never get fired. It just translates to more student debt. In the boardroom, in corporations, in certain sectors, I do think there is a need to be thoughtful about broadening the aperture of the lens 

[P84]  take a step back and look at why DEI has become such a big part of the conversation, it's precisely because instead of addressing the reality of people's lives, which is some people are disadvantaged and some people are advantaged, actually what we've mainly done, and Scott alluded to at the very beginning of our discussion, is we've given a leg up to very wealthy ethnic minority people from successful families, and they now, their children now get into 

[P87]  in the British Empire, whatever. That was the ethnic group that was like the dominant one. And everybody else was a kind of second-class citizen and everybody knew it, right? We don't have that anymore. We have highly diverse societies where people of every single background exist in which we have this idea that we're all supposed to be equal. And when we have programs that explicitly discriminate against people, there were times when the discrimination was explicit 

[P90]  very best possible person for this job at the price I'm willing to pay. I don't care if they are purple, green, blue, white, whatever. It doesn't matter. What matters is, are we getting the best person for the job? And my concern about identity politics has always been that if we do not adopt that worldview, then what we will do is create a worldview in which we have different racial groups competing with each other on the basis of race. 

[P93]  We don't care what you bring to the workplace. We don't care whether you deserve this place or not. We don't care about the potential you have. Actually, we just needed an insert category tick box to fill this slot. And you filled it. It doesn't really matter that you're not doing your job very well because now we can say, you know, we're a diverse company. I don't care about that and we shouldn't care about that as a society. And thank God that's now gone. Yeah, I think the worst part about it too is that it calls into question 

[P96]  as opposed to the identities that we want to advantage list. And I think that was the choice. You know, at the beginning, Constantine, you said, you know, America had a choice. And for me, when I looked at those two websites, I saw this choice between the identities being the main thing or the to-do list being the main thing and very different approaches. Scott, when I was listening to that Zuckerberg interview talking about masculinity and identity issues, one of the lines he said in there, 

[P99]  I don't think he really understands an aspirational view of masculinity. I think when he couches immediately kind of trying to kiss Trump's ass because Trump threatened to put him in prison, and what he used to call moderation, he's now calling censorship. And when you have an algorithm that elevates incendiary hateful content, I would not describe that as masculinity. For me, masculinity comes down to protection, providing, and procreation. 

[P102]  I work out at CrossFit with a bunch of lesbian firefighters. They bring great masculine energy, and they could carry my ass out of a fire. So a lot of men demonstrate wonderful feminine qualities. A lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculine qualities. I don't think these things are sequestered to anyone born as a specific gender. What I think, when I talk about masculinity, I don't talk about it in the role of corporations. I think that's as fraught with risk and not worth talking about. It should be about shareholder value or stakeholder value. 

[P105]  code that they used to get from the armed services or from dual parent households. And I feel like they're struggling. So I like the idea of something that they feel in their bones and in their body and in their DNA that they can lean into that we celebrate. And the conversation is flipped entirely. Five years ago, I was called a misogynist for talking about masculinity. Now the conversation is being led and advocated by one group, and it's mothers who are like, 

[P108]  coarseness, too much cruelty, too much bullying. I don't think that's masculinity. I think when we talk about Elon Musk taking risks, sending rockets that are captured by scissors coming down, inspiring the EV race, taking an enormous risk, making a shit ton of money. Yeah, that's a great form of masculinity. Accusing men trying to save high soccer players, calling them pedophiles, calling your employees a sex criminal such that they have to leave their house, having 13 kids by five women or three women, none of which you live with, 

[P111]  put in code Diary40 to try this delicious multi-flavored matcha now. Highly recommend. And if you do it, please tag me, send me a message online. Do you know that 80% of New Year's resolutions fail by February? It's because we focus too much on the end goal and we forget the small daily actions that actually move us forward. Those actions that are easy to do are also easy not to do in life. It's easy to save a dollar, so it's also easy not to. Making one small improvement each day, one tiny step in the right direction, has a big difference over time. 

[P114]  noticed, Scott, you'd left X. You no longer post or tweet on X anymore. Do you think Elon's decision to buy X is a net positive for society? Net, yes. But I think what people hear when you say that is there's no problems with this system than, you know, compared to the ones we had before. There are definitely disadvantages to a free platform like X now. And one of them is 

[P117]  that are algorithmically driven, where the truth and the moderate reasonable take is not what usually gets attention, you're going to see a lot of unpleasantness. I value the ability to hear and communicate truthful ideas and facts over my own subjective feelings. Oh, someone said a thing I don't like or someone was racist or someone was misogynistic. I don't enjoy the fact that that happens. 

[P120]  daily basis until serious action was taken. And we saw real, real change, real change in policing, real change in social work, real change in government, real change in the way that these racially aggravated hate crimes were treated. Well, none of that was really being talked about seriously until Elon kicked up a fuss, amplified the voices of survivors, amplified the voices of campaigners on X, which he bought. And now the British government is forced 

[P123]  now? And why has he chosen Keir Starmer as the sort of central target of this flurry of tweets around the grooming scandals? Because there's clearly, Elon's, I think, an individual which you can kind of see thinking in real time. Like if you go back through his tweets, because there's so many of them, and they kind of come in these spurts, you can almost see what he's getting at. Is there an underlying reason why he's made this a central issue over the last couple of weeks? 

[P126]  about online censorship. That has an impact because if something exists in the UK and in many European countries, it's only a matter of time before people in America are going to say, well, look, they've got this in Europe. Why don't we bring it over here? And vice versa. So what happens in America affects us in Europe and in the UK. And what happens in Europe and the UK affects America. So what Elon, I think, is trying to do is to say, we care about our civilization. Elon doesn't really talk that much about the United States. 

[P129]  to interview him, which I really look forward to doing, because I think he's one of the great visionaries of our time. Whether you like him or not, I think that's undeniably true. But my sense is he's trying to talk about all the things that we've been discussing, freedom of expression, the end of identity politics and the pursuit of meritocracy, a pioneering, inspiring vision of the future, which is why he's talking about Mars and a vision for our civilization that goes beyond the narrow squabbling 

[P132]  You are destroying that sense of optimism and vision. And you're not saying to people, let's build something better. You're saying, let's stay small. Let's play small. Let's not rise above our station. And I think we need people like that, imperfect as they may be in all sorts of different ways, to drive our civilization forward, to say to us, there is an inspiring vision to which we're all moving, as opposed to just sitting there and waiting to die, which is what we've been doing for far too long. 

[P135]  and they've come, you know, this is their chance to get revenge on big tech in the next four years. They could do a little, you know, you might see Google have to, you know, spin off YouTube or you might see AWS have to come away from Amazon or something like that. Who knows? But it's interesting that a lot of these big tech guys, they're probably cozying up to Trump because, you know, that could be on the cards as well. There's been a lot of Trump butt kissing over the last couple of weeks. 

[P138]  A hallmark of a free society and a democracy is that pretty much anyone can say pretty much anything about pretty much anybody. I believe that. The question is, do machines and bots have free speech rights? Because if I say something, I believe, and I may be paranoid, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong. I believe VCs whose portfolio companies I've said have overvalued have enlisted thousands of bots to basically just shitpost me over and over on X to diminish my credibility. 

[P141]  is, when you have a business model that elevates the most incendiary, ugly content beyond its organic reach, should you then be exonerated from all liability and slander that traditional media companies are liable to? If we were to say that Elon Musk is a pedophile and start stating facts and evidence of it, and he could show that it's hurt his ability to raise money for Tesla, and he filed legal action against this podcast, 

[P144]  Wait, Elon agrees with you. When he bought X, he talked about the bot problem. He talked about the amplification of outrage. He hasn't done as much as I hoped he would have done so far, but I hope that they do address that because that isn't an Elon or an X problem. It's a technology problem of the modern world. The reality is that the more we live our lives online, the more you're going to have the problem of the ability of foreign governments, of individual people to create fake accounts, 

[P147]  Love your content. Let's take a picture. They're so nice. Another person comes up to me and says, I disagree with your view on this, but we have a civil conversation. And then I come home to 40 bots telling me I'm Professor Genocide. I mean, people in the real world, generally speaking, I don't know if it's because of the threat of physical violence, or they want to have sex with you, or maybe they think at some point you'll hire their kid, or generally just a comity of man. But people in real life, I find, are just lovely and wonderful. And it's a shame that these LLMs aren't calling this. 

[P150]  I think we could solve a lot of this problem by just removing 230 protections for algorithmically elevated content. If you decide to elevate content beyond its organic reach, then you are making an editorial decision and you should be liable if that, in fact, is slanderous or defamatory. I think that's really fascinating as a way of handling it. And also, we're living in a world where, as of this year, some of the most phenomenal content you will read will be algorithmic. 

[P153]  you click on it, you get scammed. I think it's a crypto scam. I don't want to click. I'll send the link to you guys so you can click on it for me. But I just, it really has, because that is a bot. There's multiple of them, multiple accounts that have been spun up. They're all verified accounts. And it's AI generated imagery with a paid ad behind it. That's the bit that really gets me. I get people can post shit, but sponsoring it is a new level of defamation. One of the big macro things I've been thinking a lot about 

[P156]  one of the reasons, you know, I know you have pretty much all your interviews face to face and we do as well, because I generally speaking, it's very difficult to connect authentically with people. Obviously, we've managed to do it in the course of this conversation, but beyond that, it's difficult. And so we're going to have to work on that. But I just what the point I'm trying to make is this isn't a political issue. It's not an X issue. It's not an Elon Musk issue. It's a technological issue. We're living through 

[P159]  believe, and we now live in this, we don't live in England or in Scotland or in America. We live almost like in a world of people who think like us in the West. And then other people live right next door to us who live in a whole different world because they consume a whole different set of information. That is the reality. We can complain about it. That is not going to change. And the only thing I really want to, 

[P162]  then the question for you is, well, you know, let's say right now I look at Twitter and I'm like, yeah, I'm happy to verify my identity. I'm happy to confirm who I am. Well, what if, you know, George Soros buys X off Elon at some point? Are you still happy that that information is being held? Are you still happy that the anonymous account you've now made confirmed? You know, what happens to the anonymous activists speaking about the Ayatollah's regime in Iran? 

[P165]  the civil rights activist or the women's rights activist that needs an anonymity, you could create a number of accounts and use blockchain or some sort of third-party anonymous to have a certain number of accounts that says, look, if you want an anonymous parody account, you want to make fun of people, fine. If you want an account talking about issues that you feel are sensitive from other markets, fine. We could absolutely figure that out and then figure out, okay, this account is doing nothing. It has no base. It has no soul. 

[P168]  The verification dimension is difficult, as I say. We're going to have to hash this all out as humanity. We're just going to have to work this all out. How do we live in this new world that we now live in? It's going to take some time. And I hope it's not as bad as the last time the information space was revolutionized, which was the printing press. That caused about two centuries of religious war. Hopefully we can avoid that. And part of the way to do that is to create environments which are uncensored, 

[P171]  into probably won't exist. We need to have a radical look at this idea that children should go to school with the same age groups or study a certain set of topics or that it should be topic-based at all. We need to explore, you know, are there better models for the schooling system that prepare people for the world that we're going to be in? Our current schooling system goes back to the early 1800s. 

[P174]  companies and people in the world trying to convince people, especially young men, that they can have a reasonable facsimile of life on a screen with an algorithm. And I think they literally go crazy. I think they wake up and they're obese and lonely and have no skills. We talked about this. I think young people, I say this jokingly, but seriously, I think young people need to get out of the house more, drink more, make a series of bad decisions that might pay off. I think we need more sex. I think we need more people in third spaces. 

[P177]  That is an ideological decision. It's done because we're saving the planet. That's what we're being told. The reality is our contribution to global carbon emissions is we're responsible for 2% of global carbon emissions in the world. Making British pensioners freeze to death every winter because they can't afford fuel bills is not the solution to climate change. And if you amplify that further, 

[P180]  deeply, deeply immoral to impoverish already poor pensioners in this country and to prevent businesses from hiring people and giving them jobs and opportunities, including the young men that Scott is talking about, because we are saving the planet and we're trying to keep little Greta happy. We're not doing any of that. We're not successful in that. We should stop pretending and we should do what Donald Trump said he plans to do, which is drill baby drill. We should be exploring and exploiting all the energy reserves 

[P183]  than the previous Trump admitted. I mean, just to call Biden anti-energy or that somehow we have this massively overinflated energy prices, it's just not, that hasn't happened in the US. I would like, we need more homes in the US. And in the UK too. And Stephen, let me just, before you wrap up, fill the stats out a little bit more. Obviously, everyone understands that geopolitically we're in a pretty tense time and there's conflicts happening. 

[P186]  And what Ed Miliband is about to do to this country when it comes to this issue needs to talk about way more. And it is about economic prosperity. It is about housing, because one of the reasons we don't build as much housing as we need to is, again, building housing produces emissions. And we don't want to be not green. So that's why people in their 30s and 40s are now living in flat shares for four people. We have got to let go of this obsession with net zero. We have got to build. We have got to drill. 

[P189]  them for a world that's fast changing is difficult. We're taking the approach of a lot of general knowledge across a lot of things so that you can use AI to run deep in different topics. We're encouraging the kids to interact with supervised AI conversations and letting them know that that technology is available. We're also just focusing on some manual skills, like how to fix a boiler and how to saw through some wood. 

[P192]  Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. You are not living in the worst time ever. You're surrounded by pussies. If you are a man and if you do your job and if you learn the skills that you need to do and if you pursue the things that you want to do with your life to the best of your ability, if you believe in yourself, if you believe that you're talented, if you actually achieve the things that you set your mind to, there's never been a better time in the history of humanity than now. You're surrounded mostly by people who feel sorry for themselves, 

[P195]  business and trying to be kind. And what I do, I do talk to them about the concept of surplus value. I'm like, you're takers right now. You know, the UK school system, which is amazing, is investing a lot in you and you're giving almost nothing back. Me and your mother are loving you a lot more than you're loving us. You're just taking resources everywhere. You're a net negative. And you're crossing the manhood isn't sex or some religious ceremony. You're crossing the manhood is when 

[P198]  I'm like, then you need to pay. I mean, that's the bottom line. Anyways, but what I would say is I'm trying to model. I'm trying to model good behavior or be a good role model. But I agree with Constantine and Daniel. I think every day they have more potential to lead the most amazing life in history. I'm not a nihilist. I'm not a catastrophist. I think I have big problems. But given the blessings of the sons born to these,

主题：社交媒体与言论自由

输入内容：
[P113]  Censorship. The word censorship was used there by Scott. We've seen this reversal in Meta's attitude, Facebook's attitude that had been built up over a decade, where it almost felt like if you had sort of right-leaning views or really any unaccepted views and you posted those on Facebook, you would face maybe having the post deleted or your account suspended. This new world of speech, of free speech, and as it pertains to masculinity. 

[P116]  And I'm delighted to welcome him. I'm sure it's entirely genuine and not anything to do with the election results we've just seen in any way whatsoever. And the fact that the culture shifted and those of us who were being censored by people like him for years actually winning the argument. Well, what it shows you is we've won the argument on free speech when it comes to the big tech platforms. And it's going to be messy. 

[P119]  that's a good thing. And I think that's helpful. And if you look at, you know, to bring it back to the UK for a moment, Stephen, as you know, on Trigonometry, we've tried to cover the grooming gangs scandal and is an outrage what happened in this country over decades. We've been covering that for years, since about 2019, 2020, to very little purchase. And one of the reasons is it was just something that the media sort of covered and then moved on, when it actually should have been something we talked about on 

[P122]  by someone like Elon Musk on a platform like X, which is now free, to the point where Keir Starmer is forced into defensive action. I wish that was around 30 years ago because a hell of a lot of young girls and women wouldn't have suffered the way they did if we had the opportunity to get that message out. So, God, yes, it's a net positive. Just to pick up on that, Constantine, I've had a question in my mind for a while regarding the scandal, which is horrific, I think it's something we all definitely agree on, is why has Elon chosen 

[P125]  now in front of their mind. The second issue, I think, is that Elon Musk understands what I said earlier, which is we have a global Western culture now. And so what happens in Britain matters just as much as what happens in America, because we are symbiotic with each other now. When there's a restriction of speech in the UK, when we have laws about what people are not allowed to say, that has an impact across the world. When you see the European Union trying to pass legislation, 

[P128]  it properly, although there were individual members of the cabinet that tried to do something like Sir Le Braverman. But he's putting pressure on the government of the day. You can see him going after Nigel Farage, of all people, and saying Nigel Farage is not the right leader for reform. So he's attempting to shape British politics in the direction that he feels is the right way. What does he want? What outcome does he want? Look, I don't know what Elon Musk wants. I don't know him personally. I haven't even yet had a chance 

[P131]  I want things to be better for my children. I want to have children. I want the vision of our society being one of positivity and optimism and a sense of a pioneering vision and inspiration. That's what I think he wants. And I don't really see any of that in the current government in the UK. And I think he's right to go after them and say, you are destroying your country's economy. You're destroying its culture. You're destroying its sense of cohesiveness by allowing illegal immigration. 

[P134]  as well. Like the way he works needs stress in his life. He needs a big enemy. He needs a big fight to engage with. And I think Keir Starmer just ticked all of his boxes as someone to go up against. I think what's interesting is we talk about these big tech. I love that Scott has previously talked about breaking up big tech. And I think there's potential for that in the next four years. All of these guys like Trump and JD Vance and all of them have locked horns with big tech. 

[P137]  And I am quite curious to ask you why you made the decision to leave X and to go to Blue Sky and Threads and things like that. Yeah, I can't speculate on what motivates Elon Musk. I quite frankly just don't get the guy. And I don't have the domain expertise to comment on the rape gangs. It's such a serious, upsetting issue. I don't know it well enough to speak intelligently to it. Just the topic of censorship, though, as it relates to meta, 

[P140]  and you knew it was false, and you decided to communicate it anyways, courts find them liable. They have to pay three quarters of a billion dollars. What happened at Fox News was a dumpster fire compared to the nuclear mushroom cloud on Meta. So a lot of what we're talking about here, if you want to say that mRNA vaccines alter your DNA, I think you should have the right to say that. The dissenter's voice is important because occasionally the conspiracy theorist ends up being correct. 

[P143]  There's something wrong when we have algorithms that have a profit incentive around rage, conspiracy theory, and lies, and two-thirds of Republicans believe that the election was stolen, when one in five Americans think that 9-11 was an inside job. Let's be honest. They thought that before the internet. I remember watching all the 9-11 truth of movies and all of that. But your point overall is right. I totally agree. 

[P146]  encountered sane, rational people who had very different views to you that you had to be friends with long term. Whereas where we are right now is if you've got some sort of crazy view, you can find yourself only talking to people who share those views and only sharing content that reinforces those views until such time that you become extremely radicalized. I think that's such an important point because I think it's a real shame that AI LLMs aren't crawling the real world. I was at Granger's yesterday. Someone comes up to me. 

[P149]  illegal. I don't think the government should step in. But I don't have to paint his fence. And I can go to another platform. That's my right, too. And everyone says, oh, you're against free speech. I'm like, no, I'm not. I'm against being on a platform that makes me feel bad. So he has the right. And all this notion around meta, free speech, it's a little different because they control so much of the media. But these are media companies, and they should be liable for slander or defamation, the same way traditional media companies are in 

[P152]  WhatsApp from friends. I actually had two tweets yesterday, which you could probably see if you just search my name. Because on X at the moment, there's multiple ads running that are fake articles with fake BBC headlines with my face in. So it says things like, the Bank of England is suing Steve Bartlett. And this is running as a sponsored ad on X. And people are tweeting me these things. My friend says every time he refreshes the feed, he sees a new sponsored ad of a fake article of me. And sometimes it's like, can't believe this happened to Steve. And it's a BBC article. 

[P155]  argumentation of our reality. And it comes, you know, Scott's point about people behaving better in person is true. Although I would say there is the windscreen effect or the windshield effect, which is if someone cuts you up in traffic and you feel that there's some kind of physical separation between the two of you, most people behave slightly differently in that context than they would if they were sitting next to somebody face to face in a bar. So there's something about being physically present with other people that changes it, 

[P158]  in which you have these machines that take every rule literally and suddenly you find that, you know, the desire to protect humanity results in the end of humanity. How do you navigate all of this? And that is what we're living through. We are also living through a period when our realities are being fragmented. And so we believe a very small set of things that other people like us somewhere in a very different part of the world, as Daniel was saying earlier, 

[P161]  That's a very difficult one because one of the challenges is the only way to really deal that I can see with the bot problem is to get people to verify their identity online. That obviously has a lot of questions around that because once you start forcing people to give their identity over to some anonymous blob online, who's collecting that data? What are they doing with it? 

[P164]  If you implemented, we have, first off, this notion that you don't want to give up your identity. Trust me, they know everything about you, Constantine, already. And I could go get a ton of information on you from the dark web fairly easily with a credit card. So the notion that somehow we shouldn't have some sort of, you could have, we need age verification for social media. There's no reason anyone in the age of 16 should be on a social media platform. And regarding the, 

[P167]  conversations we should be having. How do we make sure? I mean, my son is two and a half years old. And if my wife has become a complete screen Nazi, so he's probably not going to get a phone until he's about 40. But I think your point about people shouldn't be on social media. People shouldn't be on social media until they're 16. Absolutely correct. What that's doing to the minds of, well, or everybody, but particularly young people who are really susceptible to it. 

[P170]  what's the most important thing that we should be talking about that isn't getting enough attention right now as it relates to the future of the West? And that's a big, broad question. I'll start with you, Daniel. For me, it's the schooling system. I think the schooling system is not preparing people for a world that exists and that we're teaching. You know, we haven't grasped the fact that AI is going to be the biggest, most disruptive technology in the lives of our children 

[P173]  right who are crazy are just overrepresented. And they come together to meet on reckless spending, deficit spending. They come together to agree on anti-Semitism. And there's just too many people on the far left and the far right. And the people in the middle, it's minority rule. They're just not represented. However, I think the biggest threat that people aren't talking about, and I've actually spent some time talking with the administration around this, or the former administration, I should say, is loneliness. And that is, you have the deepest pocketed, most well-resourced 

[P176]  15 minutes for a reason. This shit is hard and it's worth it. But I worry that we're raising, like I said, this new species of asocial, asexual being called the young American male that is obese, anxious, and just a shitty citizen. Constantine, the most important thing in 2025 that's not getting enough attention? In the UK and in most of Europe, it's an issue that Daniel raised earlier, which is in the UK, our energy prices are four times what they are in the United States. 

[P179]  so that we can have a prosperous economy. And guess what? When people are prosperous, that's when they actually start being responsible about pollution, about throwing away things they don't need. And also, when you have money, that's when you can invest money in scientific research, which allows you to find cleaner, better forms of energy. That's what we should be doing. We should be making sure that we generate as much wealth for our fellow citizens as possible, because a lot of people are struggling. 

[P182]  The drill, baby, drill, build, baby, build. I think young people have seen housing prices just go crazy. There's a psychological benefit to household formation, forced savings. So I'm going to take your word because you're a very smart guy that Britain has implemented a series of policies. That energy stat you rolled out was incredible. But in the U.S., like I said, I don't want to say we're drowning in oil. There were more drilling permits issued under Biden. 

[P185]  facilities to other countries. Okay, great idea. Globalization, make things cheaper, ship things, but wonderful. Okay, what happened during COVID? What happened when suddenly the entire chains of production weren't quite operating the way that they normally do? Oh, China's suddenly hoarding all the masks. Interesting. So what do you think is going to happen when there's a war? Or they're just going to keep shipping the steel to us to make the battleships and the warplanes that we need to fight them? That's what you think is going to happen? This whole thing, this whole agenda is ideological, 

[P188]  self for this advice but based on everything that's happening in the world which can feel incredibly confusing especially to young people where we're getting a lot of our information from different echo chambers what is the advice that you would all give to your young boys that would best prepare them for the future in the next couple of years starting with you Dan yeah so I've got a six-year-old daughter a seven-year-old son and a 

[P191]  For me, my son is two and a half, so it's a little bit early for this pep talk. But my message to him when he's old enough to hear it is going to be this. Your grandfather, your great-grandfather, my grandfather, was taken as a slave laborer from Soviet Ukraine to Nazi Germany. Your great-grandfather was born, your great-grandmother, rather, was born in the Soviet Gulag. Your great-grandmother lived through the German occupation 

[P194]  I'm older. I have 14 and 17 year old boys. And my observation is you can't tell them anything. The best you can do is you can try and model behavior for them. So I'm trying to be really kind to their mother. I'm trying to show them that, you know, if you're serious about having a good family, you got to be a generous, loving partner. I'm trying to be in great physical shape, which is getting harder and harder. I'm trying to be aggressive around them in terms of business. 

[P197]  my six-year-old boy who was all like 30 pounds got up and went over this gigantic pitcher of water at this table and like started like trying to pour other people's water and everyone had no idea what was going on here. You know, I do these things called what a man does. A man goes up to, a man asks a woman out for coffee. A man pays for women. I'm a sexist that way. I still have told my men, my son gave me this rap on, oh dad, you're so establishment. I'm like, do you ever want to have sex? 

[P200]  experience and a lot of people are experiencing at the moment so thank you to all of you i'm going to link to all of your work on the screen i know scott you've got a book coming on masculinity which we're all very very excited about we've been waiting it's long overdue please hurry up um constantine you've got an incredible podcast with trigonometry which i'm going to link on the screen and i suggest everybody goes and listens to and subscribes to if they're looking for more of this stuff and daniel you've just been on my show already but your endless amount of books and i think the best place to get more from you is your website of course uh your the daniel priestly website where you can find all of your books and all of your work and everything you're doing there

[P170]  what's the most important thing that we should be talking about that isn't getting enough attention right now as it relates to the future of the West? And that's a big, broad question. I'll start with you, Daniel. For me, it's the schooling system. I think the schooling system is not preparing people for a world that exists and that we're teaching. You know, we haven't grasped the fact that AI is going to be the biggest, most disruptive technology in the lives of our children 

[P173]  right who are crazy are just overrepresented. And they come together to meet on reckless spending, deficit spending. They come together to agree on anti-Semitism. And there's just too many people on the far left and the far right. And the people in the middle, it's minority rule. They're just not represented. However, I think the biggest threat that people aren't talking about, and I've actually spent some time talking with the administration around this, or the former administration, I should say, is loneliness. And that is, you have the deepest pocketed, most well-resourced 

[P176]  15 minutes for a reason. This shit is hard and it's worth it. But I worry that we're raising, like I said, this new species of asocial, asexual being called the young American male that is obese, anxious, and just a shitty citizen. Constantine, the most important thing in 2025 that's not getting enough attention? In the UK and in most of Europe, it's an issue that Daniel raised earlier, which is in the UK, our energy prices are four times what they are in the United States. 

[P179]  so that we can have a prosperous economy. And guess what? When people are prosperous, that's when they actually start being responsible about pollution, about throwing away things they don't need. And also, when you have money, that's when you can invest money in scientific research, which allows you to find cleaner, better forms of energy. That's what we should be doing. We should be making sure that we generate as much wealth for our fellow citizens as possible, because a lot of people are struggling. 

[P182]  The drill, baby, drill, build, baby, build. I think young people have seen housing prices just go crazy. There's a psychological benefit to household formation, forced savings. So I'm going to take your word because you're a very smart guy that Britain has implemented a series of policies. That energy stat you rolled out was incredible. But in the U.S., like I said, I don't want to say we're drowning in oil. There were more drilling permits issued under Biden. 

[P185]  facilities to other countries. Okay, great idea. Globalization, make things cheaper, ship things, but wonderful. Okay, what happened during COVID? What happened when suddenly the entire chains of production weren't quite operating the way that they normally do? Oh, China's suddenly hoarding all the masks. Interesting. So what do you think is going to happen when there's a war? Or they're just going to keep shipping the steel to us to make the battleships and the warplanes that we need to fight them? That's what you think is going to happen? This whole thing, this whole agenda is ideological, 

[P188]  self for this advice but based on everything that's happening in the world which can feel incredibly confusing especially to young people where we're getting a lot of our information from different echo chambers what is the advice that you would all give to your young boys that would best prepare them for the future in the next couple of years starting with you Dan yeah so I've got a six-year-old daughter a seven-year-old son and a 

[P191]  For me, my son is two and a half, so it's a little bit early for this pep talk. But my message to him when he's old enough to hear it is going to be this. Your grandfather, your great-grandfather, my grandfather, was taken as a slave laborer from Soviet Ukraine to Nazi Germany. Your great-grandfather was born, your great-grandmother, rather, was born in the Soviet Gulag. Your great-grandmother lived through the German occupation 

[P194]  I'm older. I have 14 and 17 year old boys. And my observation is you can't tell them anything. The best you can do is you can try and model behavior for them. So I'm trying to be really kind to their mother. I'm trying to show them that, you know, if you're serious about having a good family, you got to be a generous, loving partner. I'm trying to be in great physical shape, which is getting harder and harder. I'm trying to be aggressive around them in terms of business. 

[P197]  my six-year-old boy who was all like 30 pounds got up and went over this gigantic pitcher of water at this table and like started like trying to pour other people's water and everyone had no idea what was going on here. You know, I do these things called what a man does. A man goes up to, a man asks a woman out for coffee. A man pays for women. I'm a sexist that way. I still have told my men, my son gave me this rap on, oh dad, you're so establishment. I'm like, do you ever want to have sex? 

[P200]  experience and a lot of people are experiencing at the moment so thank you to all of you i'm going to link to all of your work on the screen i know scott you've got a book coming on masculinity which we're all very very excited about we've been waiting it's long overdue please hurry up um constantine you've got an incredible podcast with trigonometry which i'm going to link on the screen and i suggest everybody goes and listens to and subscribes to if they're looking for more of this stuff and daniel you've just been on my show already but your endless amount of books and i think the best place to get more from you is your website of course uh your the daniel priestly website where you can find all of your books and all of your work and everything you're doing there

主题：经济与政治议题讨论

输入内容：
[P2]  Go through the economy, Trump, Elon Musk, EEI, censorship, wokeism, and why so many men are struggling. Why are tens of thousands of millionaires running away from the UK? The terrifying truth and opportunity in AI. And I ask all of them, what is the most important thing in 2025 that nobody is talking about? With the aim of reaching clarity, agreement, and having a laugh in the process. This is the episode you probably didn't know you needed. 

[P7]  people feel that quote-unquote wokeism, and I don't like to use that word, but I'll use it here, was this sort of overcorrection to systemic racism and that it began to cause more damage than it was or cause more problems than it was solving. And I think there's been a serious kind of lurch back, if you will, whether it's executive actions declaring the border, a state of emergency, stuff around saying that gender is a thing, 
[P8]  and female. And most of these issues, the actually American public supports, I would say on a more cynical level, America used to be a platform for prosperity, the protection of civil rights, the projection of women's rights and power and democracy abroad. And I would argue that it feels like a pretty quick transition to almost like a, you know, I call it a kleptocracy, but America has become a platform for 
[P9]  acquiring wealth and then leveraging that wealth as a means or a proxy of power. And the ultimate example of that was the launch of two meme coins, the Trump coin and the Melania coin, the day before the presidency, such that this conversation could have already or might happen this week. And I'll finish here. President Trump, it's Vlad. We're thinking about stabilizing our currency or trying to send the outflows of our reserves. 

[P12]  make bold predictions about what's going to happen over the next six to seven months. I do think what America had at the election and what the election of Donald Trump represents is something that we in the UK don't have, which is choice. They had a very clear choice between two very different perspectives on the world, between two very different approaches, between two very different candidates. And ultimately, criticisms of President Trump are necessary and legitimate. Of course they are. 
[P13]  But at the end of the day, I believe having spent quite a lot of time in America around election time and also just generally and traveling around real America, not just in D.C. and L.A. and New York. The reason that he was elected was that the American people are not prepared to accept what Europeans have decided they're prepared to accept, which is managed decline. The American people do not want their country to become weaker. They do not want it to become poorer. 

[P15]  overall inflation figure that we're shown because certain things are much more influential in people's lives than others. And so whether the decision to elect President Trump ends up being this positive thing for which there should be lots of optimism is a matter of the next four years. Are we going to see a presidency that really does everything it promises? And by the way, you know, if you look at the things that Donald Trump is promising, 
[P16]  Whether you're left or right, you have to acknowledge that they are things that are worth doing. Having a secure border so that people don't come into your country illegally is a basic duty of government. Economic prosperity is a basic duty of government. Withdrawing America from a kind of simultaneously aggressive but weak posture around the world where America sort of says, yeah, yeah, we're going to get involved in these foreign conflicts, 

[P18]  entitled to be in female prisons. And, you know, if your teenager says that they are the opposite sex, you're supposed to chop their breasts off and all of this other stuff that ordinary people just look at and go, this is crazy. Like, I am liberal, but this isn't liberal. This is some kind of weird thing that's going on. And I see the backlash against all of that all over the Western world. And I think Donald Trump signifies that people are fed up of that. 
[P19]  that if the woke left continues to exercise this level of influence on our public debate, the reaction will be the rise of the right. And Donald Trump is one of the most diplomatic and pleasant versions of what you're likely to get if the left keeps going crazy. We will see what challenges the world throws at him over the next four years and whether he's capable of responding to them. 

[P20]  left lost its way in your view? And if so, how did that happen? And just to respond on some of Constantine's points about Trump being the best of a sort of right-wing collective, are we going to see right-wing sort of ideology spread throughout the Western world over the coming years? What's your take on all of the above? You definitely, you know, we Democrats, we get it right and then we just go too damn far. And so I look at, I'm a professor on a campus, 

[P22]  system it was trying to do away with. And then we created two candidates who were the only candidates who could make each other viable. Vice President Harris, given the hand she dealt with, did the best she did. I think President Biden should be buried in a crypt entitled narcissist who decided that it made sense for him to go back on his pledge to be a transition candidate and gave us a British-style election timing on the Democratic side in a marketplace. 
[P23]  or you need time and money. So it was not, we did not have a great candidate. There is an understandable swing back from what is an overcorrection around some of these issues. You know, parents, we gave them a huge issue with transgender rights. There's more Padel players in California than transgender people. And yet the Democrats decided to conflate it with the civil rights movement and think that it was okay for a woman who transitioned, a transgender woman, 

[P25]  in a seven-mile radius of SFO International Airport than Europe's created in the last 20 years. We have the lowest inflation in the G7. We have the highest growth. We've grown 10% since 2020. That's triple the rate of Europe. Biden was unable to communicate any of that effectively because there's this psychological dynamic that when your wages go up, you credit your own grit and character, and when the price of cereal goes up, you blame the president. Now, similar to the future, or how William Gibson described the future, 
[P26]  It's here. It's just not evenly distributed. Prosperity is unprecedented in the U.S. over the last four years. It just wasn't evenly distributed. Now, having said that, in America, you can stop working in August and you've produced more and made more money than you have in Europe the whole year. And it has gotten better. It says things are less bad than anywhere in the world in the U.S. Biden was unable to communicate it. And then talking about how great the economy is when rents were skyrocketing, tuition was going up, it was an ineffective strategy. 

[P28]  My favorite appointment in the Trump administration in the adult room is the 10 year bond, which is going to say, sorry, girlfriend, when I believe the president tries to implement some of these economic policies. Constantine, is that true? Because what I heard there is that effectively Trump had a better marketing campaign. And that reality is somewhat different from what the Americans were sold in the last election cycle. Well, politics is about marketing and Trump is the marketer in chief. 
[P29]  and partly that's what politics is about. But in terms of the economy, I think Scott is entirely right. It's one of the reasons I admire America so much, the sense of dynamism and economic growth and the desire to create things and build things. It's an observation I've had every time I've been there. You know, if you have a successful restaurant in the UK, you go, well, I've got a successful restaurant. In America, if you have a successful restaurant, you open a second one and a third one and you create a chain, right? So their attitude to business more broadly is, 

[P31]  all Western countries have a massively bloated civil service, what we call civil service in the UK and the administrative state in the US that wastes a huge amount of money, that produces very little in terms of output in many cases. And that needs to be slimmed down. And people, I think, are very excited about that. And when I talk to business leaders in America, including ones that were never on the Trump train, so to speak, so many of them went over to his side in this election cycle. 
[P32]  because they just felt that he was going to continue to accelerate American growth and continue to deliver prosperity for the American people. Now, Scott's point about tariffs and all of these other things, you know, I've listened to Donald Trump enough now to know that you should not necessarily be taking him literally. I think many of the things he says are negotiation tactics and signaling. 

[P34]  In Europe, the focus is how do we divide it up so everyone gets their fair little share, right? So Americans are about expanding the pie and then the people who bake the pie get as much of it as they possibly can. But the question is, can there be a sense in America that the American dream is alive, that you do not have to work three gig economy jobs to pay your rent, that you're going to be able to buy a house, that you're going to be able to afford to have children, 
[P35]  raise a family, perhaps on a single income, something that most people only dream about nowadays. That's really what this whole economic conversation is about. And we will see over the next four years if Donald Trump is able to slightly even change the direction of travel towards those things that actually Americans of my generation and older used to take for granted as the promise of the country that they live in. I've thought a lot about this over the last couple of weeks in particular, 

[P37]  they have in business in this country. And it's fallen 14 points to 0.2% confidence in terms of business. But there's this bigger narrative emerging amongst my entrepreneurial friends that if you want to start a business right now, the best place to be in the world is to be in America, is to get over to America and to leave the UK. Now, Dan, how does that score? I know you have an accelerator, you speak to lots of entrepreneurs. How does that sort of compare or contrast with what you're seeing at the moment? Yeah, 100%. The value proposition for the UK has dropped through the floor. 
[P38]  Very, very high tax. The ecosystem of business is in decline. Some of the smartest people are now in Dubai. Some incredible creators that I know have moved to Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai. Many are going to the USA. So if people are interested in bigger markets and bigger opportunities, they're into the USA. If they're interested in lower tax and more fringe opportunities, they're in the Middle East. 

[P40]  And a lot of US companies are now actually coming here to poach talent or to outsource things to the UK more cheaply than they could do it in the US. The wages in the UK are through the floor compared to what you would pay in the US, especially in tech roles. So very smart people in the UK are massively devalued. 
[P41]  tax, model of Dubai, Singapore, you know, those kind of options. So we haven't really picked one of those three yet. We're still, you know, all these years after Brexit, and we haven't said which of those three models we want to adopt. Scott, you moved here a couple of years ago to the UK. And despite everything that's going on in the UK, are you still bullish on this being a place for entrepreneurship and business? I was looking at some stats 

[P43]  bullish on the UK versus the US from an entrepreneur's perspective? So the question I get most frequently when I speak here is to compare and contrast the US with the UK. And I use a personal anecdote. My parents immigrated to the US from Glasgow and London when they were 19 and 22. They took enormous risks. I've been an entrepreneur my whole life. I like to think that a lot of my success isn't my fault, that I inherited sort of that risk-taking DNA. And when I speak to people in the UK, I say the primary difference is 
[P44]  And that is, it kind of comes down to a risk appetite. The U.S. has five times per capita the number of entrepreneurs. It has five times the dollar volume per startup. There's $5 million in venture capital waiting to be deployed for every startup in the U.S. versus $1 million in Europe. I love what Constantine said about a restaurant. I went into this great little restaurant in Soho a few weeks ago called Dig In, and I loved it so much. I left my card and said, can you have the owner? 

[P46]  my impression of the UK economy, I'll just say London. I have no experience in it. I don't go anywhere that's not walking distance from Marlebone. So my bubble is pretty opaque. But the way I would describe the economy here is I love the term the butler economy. And that is all the money I see being made here is people servicing wealth created somewhere else. You're either in financial services servicing rich people. You're either opening a restaurant or hospitality. 
[P47]  quality servicing rich people, but I don't see a lot of organic wealth creation. I interviewed the two, quote unquote, inventors of AI at one of your prestigious universities. My first question is, how the hell were you not able to make any money if you invented AI? Why haven't you been able to capture any money? But just for your listeners, my summation of Europe versus the US after molesting the earth for the last 35 years is US is still the best place to make money and Europe is still the best place to spend it. Is this a failing nation, Scott? 

[P49]  An American can't understand why you would decide to increase your prices while reducing productivity in one fell swoop. It's difficult for us to wrap our heads around some of the economic decisions the UK has made. But I think a lot of people are kind of betting or hoping that the UK begins to grow again. So in a weird way, I would call myself cautiously optimistic about the UK. I think at some point it registers. 
[P50]  it begins to occupy the place it should command, if you will. Constantine, I would ask the same question to you as well. Do you think the UK is a failing nation? And Scott describes self-inflicted wounds there. I've heard you speak of self-inflicted wounds when you talk more broadly about the West and what the West needs to do to turn itself around. And also just layering a third point on top of that, which is somewhat linked to this, is Elon Musk has taken a particular interest in the UK over the last month in particular. 

[P52]  almost everything from America, right? America has become what Britain used to be, which is the center of Western civilization. And my request and ask and begging of British people is, if we're going to download American culture and politics, let's at least take the good stuff instead of all this terrible woke shit that we downloaded from them, the DEI and all this other nonsense, and actually take the entrepreneurial spirit and all these other things that are really great about America, the optimism, 
[P53]  the positivity, the willingness to have a go, to take a risk, as Scott was talking about. So I wish we took more of that. And it speaks to your question about are we a failing nation? Look, I think it's a deliberately inflammatory question, which I don't want to kind of actually accept in that way. But what I think we should acknowledge is are we trending up or are we trending down? And when you talk about over 10,000 millionaires, 

[P55]  have been rewarded. We see them because we, you know, we have this history of the landed gentry. And so to us, a millionaire is someone who has these ill-gotten gains that they don't deserve, right? That is not really the world we live in. When I talk to wealthy people in this country and pretty much everywhere else, for the most part, especially in the Western world, these are people who've created something that has fundamentally helped other human beings do something better, do something easier, 
[P56]  products, cheaper, whatever it is. That's who the successful people really are. And we just need an attitude shift. That's what we should be downloading from America. What we should be saying inside our heads is this person is successful because they've helped other people. Great. How do we get more of those people into our country? And I'm afraid I'm telling you something that you know better than anyone, Stephen. If you don't have entrepreneurs in your country creating businesses and creating jobs, 

[P58]  creativity. You've got sitting in one city, you've got people who are phenomenal at media, finance, technology, entertainment, politics, defense, like all of this. Like if you take the best of LA and Washington and New York and Miami and kind of start moving it into one city, you know, you get elements of that in London. It's a very diverse city from that point of view, and it creates an entrepreneurial melting pot. The issue is taxes. Nobody wants to pay 
[P59]  60% of their income in taxes. And as soon as you hit, you know, in the US, you don't hit the top tax rate until you are six times the average wage. Here in the UK, it's two and a half times. So as soon as you're two and a half times the average wage, you're in real trouble. There are so many people in the UK who deliberately hold their income at £50,000 because after £50,000, you get taxed 40% of your income. So people just give up and they say, I'm not going, I know some 

[P61]  The council tax is high. All of these additional taxes just keep piling up. And then the other cost at the moment, if we want to have an AI economy, we need cheap electricity. One thing that Trump has committed to is really, really cheap energy. There is no such thing as a fast growth, high octane economy that has expensive energy. Cheap energy equals fast growth. And we have the most expensive energy in the world. 
[P62]  Scott, you look like a lot of thoughts are going through your head following those two comments. What are you thinking? 

[P64]  was people under the age of 30 who in the U.S. are 24% less wealthy than they were 40 years ago, people over the age of 70 or 72% wealthier. Our tax code is basically an attempt to shove money from the young to the old. And two, 45 to 64-year-old women who I would affectionately describe as their mother. And that is when your son's in the basement vaping and playing video games, and I think a lot about struggling young men, you don't give a flying fuck about territorial sovereignty in the Ukraine, or Ukraine, excuse me, or transgender rights. 
[P65]  is your kid isn't doing well. And 210 times a day, your kid's getting a notification that somebody he knows is on a Gulfstream or partying in St. Bart's and it's not him or her. And so we not only have young people not doing as well, this pornographic wealth is just shoved in their face. And you end up with, in my opinion, kind of a young, struggling young man. No group has fallen further faster in the world, I would argue, than young men in America. 

[P67]  into their professional lives. More single women own homes in the U.S. than single men. Women in urban areas under the age of 30 are making more money than men. When men don't have the guardrails of a relationship or a job or being in school, they pour that energy sometimes into unproductive things, misogyny, nationalism or extreme nationalism, conspiracy theory. In some, they become really shitty citizens. They become sequestered from society. So I'm worried in the U.S., our biggest threat is a new species of asexual. 
[P68]  asocial young men who are incredibly dangerous have opted out of America. 60% of 30-year-olds used to have one child in America, and that's 27%. So people, I think, in the U.S., and this is a genuine question. I don't know if it's the same problem here. Our tax policies have taken money from the young, stuffed them in the pockets of old people so Nana and Pop-Pop can upgrade from Carnival to Crystal Cruises. Meanwhile, young people can't afford education. They can't afford housing. 

[P70]  In my opinion, this is the most dangerous trend in America right now. It was almost like demonizing men for decades has consequences. I mean, this is what's been happening. Men are the root of all evil, the root of all evil, the root of all evil. Every advert is about, you know, the woman is strong and capable. The guy's pathetic. In every movie, the woman's kicking ass and the man is pathetic. This has been going on for decades. It's a cultural thing as well as an economic thing. 
[P71]  meaning and opportunity away from men. If you create an education system that punishes boys for being boys, if you create a society in which traditional masculine virtues become vices, then you will create exactly the sort of thing that Scott is talking about. It's a terrible thing that's been done. Having said that, my message is always the same to young men who I hope are listening, which is the answer to your problems is never going to be, as Scott says, porn and this and that. 

[P73]  men is going to be the answer that's always been the answer for men, which is for you to get off the sofa, to get off the couch and go out and actually do and create and build and find your own way through it. Even if you have to acknowledge that the society you live in has been conditioned for quite a long time to think that you're a piece of shit because you happen to have the genitalia that you do. Now, that I think is the harsh reality of it. And I think Scott is right to point this out as a problem. And I hope that we start to have 
[P74]  both in terms of economic policy, but in terms of also just the cultural conversations and the way we talk about these issues, we come back to something that human beings have known through the entire history of our species, which is men and women are both good and need to work together in order to thrive and succeed together, in order to have families, in order to have children, and in order for us to have healthy communities and healthy societies. You need healthy femininity and you need healthy masculinity, and they need to come together and work together. 

[P76]  We've seen 
[P77]  whack DEI measures. So I think there's a lot of nuance here. I would argue in universities, DEI is used as a giant misdirect from people such as myself who are enforcers of the caste system and wake up every morning and look in the mirror and ask ourselves the same question. How do I increase my compensation while decreasing my accountability? And what I found is the ultimate strategy is to create an LVMH rejectionist bullshit, elitist strategy, where Dartmouth sits on a 

[P79]  own tail, started out with the right idea. Now it's nothing. And I would argue the same is somewhat true of the Democratic Party. I went to the Democratic National Convention. On the dnc.org website, it lists 17 special introscripts, and it says explicitly who we serve, Asian Pacific Islanders, seniors, veterans, Black Americans, the disabled. It basically lists, I added this up, 76% of the population. And when you say you're actively advocating for 76% 
[P80]  of the population. You're not advocating for 76% of the population. You're discriminating against the 24%. It's gone too far. I would argue in the workplace, having served on seven public company boards, and I'm going to do a lot of boasting here because I'm desperate for all of your affirmation, and 12 private company boards, there's still work to be done in the private sector. There still is a cycle. 40% of all venture capitalists and probably 70% or 80% of all venture capital deployed 

[P82]  people who are underrepresented. There's still a dearth of women raising venture capital. So I think it's nuanced based on sector. But to just say all DEI is bad, I want to move to where the University of California did in 1997. They don't have race-based affirmative action. They have adversity-based affirmative action. I'm a beneficiary of affirmative action. I had something called Pell Grants. I was raised by a single immigrant mother who lived and died as secretary. So I got grants. I had 
[P83]  unfair advantage because I came from a household that was low income. And I think that there should be affirmative action. And I think it should be based on color, but that color is green. The poor need our help. The moment you start advocating for a special advantage based on any external factors, I think at this point in our society, it probably causes more problems than it solves. That's exactly right. That's exactly right, Stephen. 

[P85]  prestigious universities, which they probably would have done anyway, some of them, because they come from very advanced backgrounds. And the kids that are growing up in poverty, black and white, have no shot whatsoever. But the reason that it's become such a big issue around the Western world, actually, I don't think it's the nuances that we've delved into here, but actually something else, which is we have created the most ethnically diverse societies in history. And what I mean by that is, 
[P86]  not that we've created societies in which there are large groups of people who are different from each other, but for the first time probably in human history, we've created societies in which there is a lot of ethnic diversity and there is no overt discrimination against some groups of people in the sense of, you know, the imperial societies in the past would have had one dominant ethnic group, which is, you know, the Russians in the Soviet Union or the Turks in the Ottoman Empire 

[P88]  black people. Well, we've gone full circle now where the discrimination was going the other way in university admissions, in hiring, in corporate America, in government, in all sorts of things. You know, in this country, the BBC has internships that aren't available to white people, etc. When you get to that point, as Scott said earlier on, everyone just goes, look, I know I'm not supposed to say this, but the reality is this is racism. This is a form of racism. And I thought we were trying to get away from the 
[P89]  So to the extent that the elimination of DEI is about creating a merit-based society in which people are given an opportunity because they're skilled and talented and they have the potential to actually achieve things and create wealth. You know, we all know this. We all employ people, right? How many of us are thinking about the races of the people we hire? I don't think we think about that at all. What we're thinking about is I run a business. I need the very best personable. 

[P91]  very dangerous mix for a multi-ethnic society like ours, which is why I've been begging people to let go of this stupid idea of identity politics and to say, first and foremost, we are all Brits or we are all Americans. We have this umbrella identity under which we all operate and our personal ethnicity or sex or whatever is secondary to that and actually for the purposes of employment, for the purposes of college admission, et cetera, is irrelevant. 
[P92]  Yes, if there is disadvantage, if we grew up in a single-parent home with a low income, we may need some extra support there. If we had terrible schooling or our education was not good, we may need extra support. If there's certain things that make it easier for us because of the disadvantages we've had to fulfill our talent and potential, I am all for that. But what we've created so far, and that's why I'm delighted it's being eliminated, is an anti-meritocratic system which says, 

[P94]  and they're from a diverse background, you know, it calls into question why they got that job in the first place, which I think is horrible. You know, I just hired from two candidates, the final two candidates was a guy and a woman. I would hate if the woman felt that she got the job because she's a woman and not because she's best. She turns out she was by far the best in the process. And I would love for her to know that there was absolutely nothing that changed our view. 
[P95]  We weren't trying to fill a position with a woman. We were trying to fill the position with the best, and she should know she was the best. I think the contrast that was really fascinating was between Trump's website and the Democrats' website. So in the Democrats' website, it was who we're for, which was what Scott was saying. But Trump's website was the 20 things we're going to do, and it was just a list of 20. These are the 20 action points. This is what we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this. 

[P97]  like something you've said on my show before, where he said, I think having a culture that celebrates that aggression a little bit more, talking about masculinity, has its own merits that are really positive. Now, Mark Zuckerberg isn't necessarily someone that I saw closely aligning to your worldview. Am I right in thinking that that's something you agree with? Because I remember you saying to me, you think people should be able to walk in a room and kick everyone's ass. What I've said on your show is that I think the male form, especially under the age of 30, 
[P98]  with its bone structure, incredible double-twitch muscle, and then this amazing, amazing chemical called testosterone, you're going to look back at your 25-year-old self and think, why wasn't I a fucking monster like Steve Barley? And also, there is some masculinity when Russian soldiers pour over the border in Ukraine. You want some of that big dick energy that Daniel was talking about. In the case of Zuckerberg, 

[P100]  Iадib Axel- He's about gendering a workplace in the context of trying to excuse a total elimination of what I would think is probably healthy moderation. I imagine Daniel and Constantine might have a different view. 
[P101]  Right now, when I talk about masculinity, you know, there's if I say at a conference, oh, women are better managers. Everyone goes, yes, that's right. That's right. Right. That's OK. If I say men are more risk aggressive and make better entrepreneurs, you're a misogynist. You're out. And the reality is men and women bring different attributes. But the masculinity and femininity, I think masculinity is a wonderful thing. I think we need a different image of it. I think people born as male have an easier time leaning into those things. 

[P103]  I think young men need a code. We're going to church less. We have fewer relationships. So what's the code you hold on to in terms of creating behaviors that are productive for you, yourself, society? And I think masculinity needs to be redefined as something more aspirational where you're celebrated for being really fucking strong. You're celebrated for not complaining. You're celebrated for creating surplus value. You create more tax revenue than you absorb. You're celebrated for being aggressive. You're celebrated for breaking up fights at bars. 
[P104]  not starting them. You're celebrated for protecting your country, not shitposting it. You're celebrated for approaching strange women and expressing romantic interest. That's not a crime. And if she's not interested and you're rejected, you're both going to be fine. You're celebrated for getting out of the house. You're celebrated for working. You're celebrated for making money and liking money. I think there just needs to be a redefinition of masculinity in the context of helping young men 

[P106]  My son is not doing well. I got three kids, two daughters, daughters in PR with the other ones at Penn, and my son is in the basement vaping and playing video games. He needs something to latch on to. He needs a code. Anyways, but I apologize. Word salad. Zuckerberg and masculinity, give me a fucking break. He looks like a Chechen Molly dealer. Sorry, back to you, Stephen. Well, it's interesting when you speak, Scott, because your views on masculinity 
[P107]  me to be most better represented by the right side of politics than the left side of politics. They both have their own vision of masculinity. And yours seems to be a Republican view of masculinity. To Trump's credit, he saw the opportunity and he flew right into the manosphere. Rockets, crypto, Joe Rogan, Theo Vaughn. He said, no, I'm not going to run from this. I'm going to fly right into it. Now, I would argue that his vision of masculinity has too much 

[P109]  Sleeping next to a loaded gun, losing control of your self-control because of addiction. I don't think that's a great role model. I think it's an amazing role model for boys. I don't think it's a great role model for men. In terms of energy, there are so many reasons why I'm a big matcha fan, if you don't already know by now. And so much so that I actually invested in the UK's leading matcha company called Perfect Ted. And one of my favorite Perfect Ted products is these delicious matcha pouches that come in every flavor from salted caramel, 
[P110]  to peach flavor, to mint flavor, to berry flavor. One of my favorites is this vanilla flavor, which I'm going to make in just two seconds. You just take this mixer here, get a little bit of the powder, pop it on top of the shaker like that. Put the lid on. Shake, shake, shake. Delicious. If you haven't tried this yet, you can find Perfect Ted at Tesco and Holland Barrett stores or online where you can get 40% off with my code, Diary40. 

[P112]  mindset, which is why we created The 1% Diary, a 90-day journal designed to help you stay consistent and focus on the small wins and make real progress over time. It also gives you access to The 1% Community, a space where you can stay accountable, motivated, inspired, along with many others on the same journey. We launched The 1% Diary in November and it sold out. So now we're doing a second drop. Head to thediary.com to grab yours before it sells out again. I'll put the link below. 
[P113]  Censorship. The word censorship was used there by Scott. We've seen this reversal in Meta's attitude, Facebook's attitude that had been built up over a decade, where it almost felt like if you had sort of right-leaning views or really any unaccepted views and you posted those on Facebook, you would face maybe having the post deleted or your account suspended. This new world of speech, of free speech, and as it pertains to masculinity. 

[P115]  inevitably when you remove censorship, one of the things the censorship was doing was keeping all the deeply unpleasant people away from being able to shove things in your face. And that happens quite a lot on it. So I don't enjoy that aspect of it. But I've always said that would be the price that we would pay for freedom. Freedom always has a price, and that's what we're seeing. As for Zuckerberg, his miraculous transformation into a free speech warrior 
[P116]  And I'm delighted to welcome him. I'm sure it's entirely genuine and not anything to do with the election results we've just seen in any way whatsoever. And the fact that the culture shifted and those of us who were being censored by people like him for years actually winning the argument. Well, what it shows you is we've won the argument on free speech when it comes to the big tech platforms. And it's going to be messy. 

[P118]  but I would rather that happened and also we were not being censored from saying, you know, COVID probably came from a lab in China, which we were. You know, the Hunter Biden laptop story isn't Russian disinformation. Actually, it's an important piece of information that American voters need to hear when they're making their decision about the election. And all of these other things that were being suppressed and censored across social media for years, they're not anymore. 
[P119]  that's a good thing. And I think that's helpful. And if you look at, you know, to bring it back to the UK for a moment, Stephen, as you know, on Trigonometry, we've tried to cover the grooming gangs scandal and is an outrage what happened in this country over decades. We've been covering that for years, since about 2019, 2020, to very little purchase. And one of the reasons is it was just something that the media sort of covered and then moved on, when it actually should have been something we talked about on 

[P121]  to do whatever it can to actually address those issues to the extent that it will. A lot of people will say it still doesn't go far enough. Well, if it doesn't go far enough, we now have a platform from which we can continue to have that conversation until there is the sort of inquiry and the sort of outcomes that people want to actually deliver real change. So is that a positive? God, yes. God, yes. We needed that. 
[P122]  by someone like Elon Musk on a platform like X, which is now free, to the point where Keir Starmer is forced into defensive action. I wish that was around 30 years ago because a hell of a lot of young girls and women wouldn't have suffered the way they did if we had the opportunity to get that message out. So, God, yes, it's a net positive. Just to pick up on that, Constantine, I've had a question in my mind for a while regarding the scandal, which is horrific, I think it's something we all definitely agree on, is why has Elon chosen 

[P124]  is actually most Americans were completely unaware of this issue until recently. I remember a year ago speaking at a private event in New York and somebody said to me, well, you know, what is the consequence of political correctness? Why are you so against it? Why are you so against censorship? And I talked about the grooming gangs and people were horrified. They hadn't even, and these are well-informed, educated people who are media savvy and whatever. So one of the reasons is I think to a lot of Americans, this issue is only coming to the fore. 
[P125]  now in front of their mind. The second issue, I think, is that Elon Musk understands what I said earlier, which is we have a global Western culture now. And so what happens in Britain matters just as much as what happens in America, because we are symbiotic with each other now. When there's a restriction of speech in the UK, when we have laws about what people are not allowed to say, that has an impact across the world. When you see the European Union trying to pass legislation, 

[P127]  about our civilization as I do, because I believe that we are now one thing to a very significant extent. Now, from our civilizational point of view, is it a good thing that mass rape gangs in the UK are being insufficiently investigated and treated improperly by the police and the government? No, it's not. It's a very bad thing. So how do we address that? Well, we address that by putting pressure on the government of the day. Now, I don't see the grooming gangs as a party political issue. 
[P128]  it properly, although there were individual members of the cabinet that tried to do something like Sir Le Braverman. But he's putting pressure on the government of the day. You can see him going after Nigel Farage, of all people, and saying Nigel Farage is not the right leader for reform. So he's attempting to shape British politics in the direction that he feels is the right way. What does he want? What outcome does he want? Look, I don't know what Elon Musk wants. I don't know him personally. I haven't even yet had a chance 

[P130]  here on Earth. And the understanding that human beings are meant, we left the cave. We're not supposed to stay in a place with the walls closing in on us and feel like we're in decline. We're not supposed to be a civilization that has 1.5 children per woman and that is simply just leaving the planet Earth because we can't reproduce. We're supposed to look at the future with hope and optimism. We're supposed to say, 
[P131]  I want things to be better for my children. I want to have children. I want the vision of our society being one of positivity and optimism and a sense of a pioneering vision and inspiration. That's what I think he wants. And I don't really see any of that in the current government in the UK. And I think he's right to go after them and say, you are destroying your country's economy. You're destroying its culture. You're destroying its sense of cohesiveness by allowing illegal immigration. 

[P133]  I think Elon is taking him at his word. You know, he said a year ago that he was going to absolutely dismantle the woke mind virus globally and he was going to ensure meritocracy and free speech. And when he sets his mind on something, he has the ability to stay focused on it for a very long time to a degree most people can't fathom. You know, and he's absolutely willing to endure pain. He loves a fight. He obviously has the kind of mind that can't relax unless he's kind of grinding up against some gear. 
[P134]  as well. Like the way he works needs stress in his life. He needs a big enemy. He needs a big fight to engage with. And I think Keir Starmer just ticked all of his boxes as someone to go up against. I think what's interesting is we talk about these big tech. I love that Scott has previously talked about breaking up big tech. And I think there's potential for that in the next four years. All of these guys like Trump and JD Vance and all of them have locked horns with big tech. 

[P136]  bragged about the fact that everybody's flown down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss his butt and to cozy up with him. And there's now headlines saying that there's this tech oligarchy forming in the United States where Bezos and Elon and Zuck are all now friends and they're stood behind Trump as this unifying force. Just to touch on a few points of that, but also on Constantine's message that Elon is doing this for the betterment of humanity, to further humanity, his involvement with the UK, but his broader involvement in politics now. Scott, does that square with how you think about Elon? 
[P137]  And I am quite curious to ask you why you made the decision to leave X and to go to Blue Sky and Threads and things like that. Yeah, I can't speculate on what motivates Elon Musk. I quite frankly just don't get the guy. And I don't have the domain expertise to comment on the rape gangs. It's such a serious, upsetting issue. I don't know it well enough to speak intelligently to it. Just the topic of censorship, though, as it relates to meta, 

[P139]  critical of Putin that the GRU has hired troll farms to create lists of thousands of people to weaponize bots to say disparaging things about them. Do those bots have free speech rights? In addition, when Fox News distributes information to its anchors saying Dominion voting machines were weaponized by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, despite the fact they knew that was not true, but they tell their broadcasters to do it anyways. And then Dominion says, this hurt our business. 
[P140]  and you knew it was false, and you decided to communicate it anyways, courts find them liable. They have to pay three quarters of a billion dollars. What happened at Fox News was a dumpster fire compared to the nuclear mushroom cloud on Meta. So a lot of what we're talking about here, if you want to say that mRNA vaccines alter your DNA, I think you should have the right to say that. The dissenter's voice is important because occasionally the conspiracy theorist ends up being correct. 

[P142]  I think we would be in a world of hurt, and that legal liability is warranted. But the most powerful media companies in the world have Section 230 protection, so they have a business model where conspiracy theory or novel content, which is Latin for bullshit and lies, and the more angry it is, it gets elevated beyond its organic reach. So while I'm kind of down with the notion that we should have free speech and anybody should be able to say pretty much whatever they want, 
[P143]  There's something wrong when we have algorithms that have a profit incentive around rage, conspiracy theory, and lies, and two-thirds of Republicans believe that the election was stolen, when one in five Americans think that 9-11 was an inside job. Let's be honest. They thought that before the internet. I remember watching all the 9-11 truth of movies and all of that. But your point overall is right. I totally agree. 

[P145]  bot farms, et cetera, to influence the way we look at all of these things. And we are going to have to come to terms with that reality because it's a technological issue that we're going to have to solve for and we haven't yet. It's also very easy for people to get caught in their own bubbles as well, which is a new phenomenon. There was a time where if you believed crazy things, you still had to sit next to someone else in church and talk to them about their life and what they believe. And you encountered dissenting voices. 
[P146]  encountered sane, rational people who had very different views to you that you had to be friends with long term. Whereas where we are right now is if you've got some sort of crazy view, you can find yourself only talking to people who share those views and only sharing content that reinforces those views until such time that you become extremely radicalized. I think that's such an important point because I think it's a real shame that AI LLMs aren't crawling the real world. I was at Granger's yesterday. Someone comes up to me. 

[P148]  because the treif and some of the vile shit they're crawling online, which I don't even think reflects our species. I think it reflects technology that has a profit motive around promoting the most incendiary, hateful content. So there's got to be some sort of medium speed here. And also, I got off X, Steve, because you don't like Chick-fil-A, don't eat a Chick-fil-A. If Musk wants to pay $44 billion and turn it into a Nazi porn bar, that's his right. 
[P149]  illegal. I don't think the government should step in. But I don't have to paint his fence. And I can go to another platform. That's my right, too. And everyone says, oh, you're against free speech. I'm like, no, I'm not. I'm against being on a platform that makes me feel bad. So he has the right. And all this notion around meta, free speech, it's a little different because they control so much of the media. But these are media companies, and they should be liable for slander or defamation, the same way traditional media companies are in 

[P151]  generated and some of the most compelling content. So this idea that Scott's talking about, should bots have free speech? It sounds like a kind of, you know, intellectual kind of pseudo intellectual topic, but it's absolutely a very practical topic in the sense that bots now can generate conversations very easily. And some of the, you know, you could spend all day talking to a bot and not know. It's funny, this is this subject has come up because in the last week, I've had a flurry of messages on 
[P152]  WhatsApp from friends. I actually had two tweets yesterday, which you could probably see if you just search my name. Because on X at the moment, there's multiple ads running that are fake articles with fake BBC headlines with my face in. So it says things like, the Bank of England is suing Steve Bartlett. And this is running as a sponsored ad on X. And people are tweeting me these things. My friend says every time he refreshes the feed, he sees a new sponsored ad of a fake article of me. And sometimes it's like, can't believe this happened to Steve. And it's a BBC article. 

[P154]  haven't shared yet, is just the amount of social networks that have emerged. In the last 10 years, there's been a 50% increase so far in new social networks that have emerged. And we're seeing this splintering now of the rumbles, the blue skies, the threads. And it almost seems, talking about echo chambers, that social networks are becoming sort of political environments. And you're choosing your social network now based on your politics. This doesn't seem like a net positive thing for society. 
[P155]  argumentation of our reality. And it comes, you know, Scott's point about people behaving better in person is true. Although I would say there is the windscreen effect or the windshield effect, which is if someone cuts you up in traffic and you feel that there's some kind of physical separation between the two of you, most people behave slightly differently in that context than they would if they were sitting next to somebody face to face in a bar. So there's something about being physically present with other people that changes it, 

[P157]  probably already have lived through most of the digital revolution. And I used to, as a kid, love Isaac Asimov science fiction books. And one of the reasons I did enjoy reading them so much is it was a world in which there was an exploration of what does the creation of robots, which is what we're living through, mean for morality? What does it mean for philosophy? What does it mean for humanity? What does it mean for, how do we build rules in a world 
[P158]  in which you have these machines that take every rule literally and suddenly you find that, you know, the desire to protect humanity results in the end of humanity. How do you navigate all of this? And that is what we're living through. We are also living through a period when our realities are being fragmented. And so we believe a very small set of things that other people like us somewhere in a very different part of the world, as Daniel was saying earlier, 

[P160]  raise where I disagree with Scott about this idea that Facebook and X, et cetera, they are publishers and not platforms. I don't think you can apply the same media organization section to them. I don't think it's appropriate. They are platforms in which people publish information. The artificial amplification is a fair point. We need to deal with that. We need to deal with the bot problem. 
[P161]  That's a very difficult one because one of the challenges is the only way to really deal that I can see with the bot problem is to get people to verify their identity online. That obviously has a lot of questions around that because once you start forcing people to give their identity over to some anonymous blob online, who's collecting that data? What are they doing with it? 

[P163]  identity and the wrong person buys that platform or someone hacks it, et cetera. So it's a conversation that's not, if there were easier solutions on these issues, they would have been solved by now. This is a very difficult thing for humanity to navigate, and we're going to have to find a way to do it, and incrementally so. I just want to respond to that. I think you're guilty of the same illusion of complexity that protects these companies from acting like actors such that they can do anything regardless of the damage to the commonwealth to add shareholder value. 
[P164]  If you implemented, we have, first off, this notion that you don't want to give up your identity. Trust me, they know everything about you, Constantine, already. And I could go get a ton of information on you from the dark web fairly easily with a credit card. So the notion that somehow we shouldn't have some sort of, you could have, we need age verification for social media. There's no reason anyone in the age of 16 should be on a social media platform. And regarding the, 

[P166]  values. It has 72 followers. All it's doing is trying to start fights online. All it's doing is trying to make people feel shitty about Britain or shitty about America. And the reality is these companies use that illusion of complexity such that they can have more bots creating more fake clicks, more Nissan ads, and more shareholder value. I think there's a middle ground here. I think we could figure this out. I agree. Well, that's what I'm saying. I think some of the ideas that you're putting forward, right or wrong, I don't know. 
[P167]  conversations we should be having. How do we make sure? I mean, my son is two and a half years old. And if my wife has become a complete screen Nazi, so he's probably not going to get a phone until he's about 40. But I think your point about people shouldn't be on social media. People shouldn't be on social media until they're 16. Absolutely correct. What that's doing to the minds of, well, or everybody, but particularly young people who are really susceptible to it. 

[P169]  People can express different ideas. We can have these battles and eventually come to some sort of mutual understanding. I hope that happens. What I wanted to ask you all to really close out this conversation was these conversations tend to be a bit of a reflection of what's in the news cycle and what's in the news cycle tends to be a reflection of what people are clicking. And a lot of that's driven by fear and the sort of narrative of the time, whether it's immigration or the Trump inauguration. But what is the big important idea that we're not talking about? 
[P170]  what's the most important thing that we should be talking about that isn't getting enough attention right now as it relates to the future of the West? And that's a big, broad question. I'll start with you, Daniel. For me, it's the schooling system. I think the schooling system is not preparing people for a world that exists and that we're teaching. You know, we haven't grasped the fact that AI is going to be the biggest, most disruptive technology in the lives of our children 

[P172]  military schooling system in Prussia. And that's kind of where it evolved from. I think what we need to do is think about what are the, you know, what are the skills that our kids are going to need? I see too. And I can only, I don't feel like I can wrap my arms around UK's issues, but in terms of the US political extremism, I would put it number two, you know, at negative 40 Celsius and Fahrenheit meet. And because of our electoral system and Citizens United, people from the far left who are crazy and people from the 
[P173]  right who are crazy are just overrepresented. And they come together to meet on reckless spending, deficit spending. They come together to agree on anti-Semitism. And there's just too many people on the far left and the far right. And the people in the middle, it's minority rule. They're just not represented. However, I think the biggest threat that people aren't talking about, and I've actually spent some time talking with the administration around this, or the former administration, I should say, is loneliness. And that is, you have the deepest pocketed, most well-resourced 

[P175]  more church, more religious, more institutions, national service. We're mammals. And I worry that we're, one in seven men doesn't have a single friend. One in four men can't name a best friend. So this loneliness epidemic where people get into a bubble and start engaging in conspiracy theory, not trusting each other, blaming women, blaming the nation, self-harm. I just, I worry about, you know, when I say to young men, I coach a lot of young men, 
[P176]  15 minutes for a reason. This shit is hard and it's worth it. But I worry that we're raising, like I said, this new species of asocial, asexual being called the young American male that is obese, anxious, and just a shitty citizen. Constantine, the most important thing in 2025 that's not getting enough attention? In the UK and in most of Europe, it's an issue that Daniel raised earlier, which is in the UK, our energy prices are four times what they are in the United States. 

[P178]  making our economy uncompetitive, making Britain unable to generate wealth for itself and for its future is not the moral position. Net zero, which is the impoverishment of our society for ideological reasons, has been positioned as the moral cause where we're saving the planet, we're ending climate change. We're not doing any of that. All we're doing is virtue signaling and making our fellow citizens suffer. So what we should be talking about is how do we make energy cheap, again, 
[P179]  so that we can have a prosperous economy. And guess what? When people are prosperous, that's when they actually start being responsible about pollution, about throwing away things they don't need. And also, when you have money, that's when you can invest money in scientific research, which allows you to find cleaner, better forms of energy. That's what we should be doing. We should be making sure that we generate as much wealth for our fellow citizens as possible, because a lot of people are struggling. 

[P181]  this country in order to create clean energy and better forms of energy for the future, as well as to improve the well-being of our fellow citizens. That's what we should be talking about a hell of a lot more than we are. You need cheap energy. You're right. It's what I would argue. I think it's going to be liquid, natural gas and nuclear. We haven't talked about AI. AI requires 10 times the energy. The AI query is a Google query. The choke point is energy. I would argue in the US, I think we'd benefit more from as opposed 
[P182]  The drill, baby, drill, build, baby, build. I think young people have seen housing prices just go crazy. There's a psychological benefit to household formation, forced savings. So I'm going to take your word because you're a very smart guy that Britain has implemented a series of policies. That energy stat you rolled out was incredible. But in the U.S., like I said, I don't want to say we're drowning in oil. There were more drilling permits issued under Biden. 

[P184]  Britain is in a position now where we would struggle. You've got to remember British history. Britain is, Britannia rules the waves, right? The way that Britain has become a great nation throughout history is by having a powerful fleet. We would struggle to build warships now because we've closed down all our steelworks because we're green, right? It's insanity. And on every other issue to do with energy and industry, we have basically deliberately moved our production 
[P185]  facilities to other countries. Okay, great idea. Globalization, make things cheaper, ship things, but wonderful. Okay, what happened during COVID? What happened when suddenly the entire chains of production weren't quite operating the way that they normally do? Oh, China's suddenly hoarding all the masks. Interesting. So what do you think is going to happen when there's a war? Or they're just going to keep shipping the steel to us to make the battleships and the warplanes that we need to fight them? That's what you think is going to happen? This whole thing, this whole agenda is ideological, 

[P187]  We have got to produce energy and we have got to stop thinking that the moral thing to do is to make our poor citizens suffer in order that we feel good about saving the planet, which we're not even remotely saving by doing this. Guys, thank you so much for all of your perspective. One of the things I realised as you guys were talking is that you're all fathers and you're all fathers of boys, although you're fathers of boys at different ages. So I wanted to just give you all 30 seconds if you could. 
[P188]  self for this advice but based on everything that's happening in the world which can feel incredibly confusing especially to young people where we're getting a lot of our information from different echo chambers what is the advice that you would all give to your young boys that would best prepare them for the future in the next couple of years starting with you Dan yeah so I've got a six-year-old daughter a seven-year-old son and a 

[P190]  you know, those kind of things. And also we're doing things like acting classes, being up on a stage and performing. So all of those kind of typical things. But to be honest, it is a point of anxiety in my life just thinking about what, you know, what the world looks like for, you know, 10 or 15 years from now that they're going to be going into. So if you get clear answers on this, I'm really open to learning. 
[P191]  For me, my son is two and a half, so it's a little bit early for this pep talk. But my message to him when he's old enough to hear it is going to be this. Your grandfather, your great-grandfather, my grandfather, was taken as a slave laborer from Soviet Ukraine to Nazi Germany. Your great-grandfather was born, your great-grandmother, rather, was born in the Soviet Gulag. Your great-grandmother lived through the German occupation 

[P193]  If you're not one of them, you're going to clean up. Young women are looking for a young man like you who's actually going to stand up for himself, who's actually going to go out there and achieve and be confident. Be that and you're going to clean up when it comes to finding the right partner for yourself. You're going to clean up when it comes to making money. You're going to clean up when it comes to your career. You're going to clean up on every front because the bar has never been lower. The bar has never been lower. So just go out and be a man and life is going to be great. 
[P194]  I'm older. I have 14 and 17 year old boys. And my observation is you can't tell them anything. The best you can do is you can try and model behavior for them. So I'm trying to be really kind to their mother. I'm trying to show them that, you know, if you're serious about having a good family, you got to be a generous, loving partner. I'm trying to be in great physical shape, which is getting harder and harder. I'm trying to be aggressive around them in terms of business. 

[P196]  you are start creating surplus value. You're loving more people than you're absorbing. You're listening to more complaints than you are complaining. You're creating more revenue than you're absorbing. That's the notion. It's surplus value. And I have this trick called what a man does. And I've been doing this when they're kids. I'm like, guests show up. A man goes and gets their luggage and puts it in their room. A man is constantly scanning the table for empty water glasses. And I mean, one of the proudest moments I ever had was when I'm like, 
[P197]  my six-year-old boy who was all like 30 pounds got up and went over this gigantic pitcher of water at this table and like started like trying to pour other people's water and everyone had no idea what was going on here. You know, I do these things called what a man does. A man goes up to, a man asks a woman out for coffee. A man pays for women. I'm a sexist that way. I still have told my men, my son gave me this rap on, oh dad, you're so establishment. I'm like, do you ever want to have sex? 

[P199]  men and future you know future sons that you'll have steven jesus it's good to be them there's just they have no excuse they should they should they should rock on they should have a wonderful life constantine scott daniel thank you so much for taking the time um at sort of short notice to talk about all these subjects it's incredibly wide-ranging conversation and you'll bring such an interesting hilarious nuanced perspective to these issues i'm glad that we can have these conversations and disagree in a respectful way that hopefully clarifies a lot of the confusion that i 
[P200]  experience and a lot of people are experiencing at the moment so thank you to all of you i'm going to link to all of your work on the screen i know scott you've got a book coming on masculinity which we're all very very excited about we've been waiting it's long overdue please hurry up um constantine you've got an incredible podcast with trigonometry which i'm going to link on the screen and i suggest everybody goes and listens to and subscribes to if they're looking for more of this stuff and daniel you've just been on my show already but your endless amount of books and i think the best place to get more from you is your website of course uh your the daniel priestly website where you can find all of your books and all of your work and everything you're doing there

[P150]  I think we could solve a lot of this problem by just removing 230 protections for algorithmically elevated content. If you decide to elevate content beyond its organic reach, then you are making an editorial decision and you should be liable if that, in fact, is slanderous or defamatory. I think that's really fascinating as a way of handling it. And also, we're living in a world where, as of this year, some of the most phenomenal content you will read will be algorithmic.

输入内容：
[P1] ﻿ The world is absolutely crazy right now. This is one of the most interesting moments of social, cultural and economic transition that I have ever seen. So I wanted to do something that I've never done before. I called upon three of the leading voices on social, cultural, business and economic issues to give their unfiltered, uncensored points of view so that we can all make sense of all of this craziness happening before our eyes. They don't always agree on much, but today they thrash it out to see if they can agree on something. 
[P2]  Go through the economy, Trump, Elon Musk, EEI, censorship, wokeism, and why so many men are struggling. Why are tens of thousands of millionaires running away from the UK? The terrifying truth and opportunity in AI. And I ask all of them, what is the most important thing in 2025 that nobody is talking about? With the aim of reaching clarity, agreement, and having a laugh in the process. This is the episode you probably didn't know you needed.

主题：英国经济现状与未来展望

输入内容：
[P50]  it begins to occupy the place it should command, if you will. Constantine, I would ask the same question to you as well. Do you think the UK is a failing nation? And Scott describes self-inflicted wounds there. I've heard you speak of self-inflicted wounds when you talk more broadly about the West and what the West needs to do to turn itself around. And also just layering a third point on top of that, which is somewhat linked to this, is Elon Musk has taken a particular interest in the UK over the last month in particular. 
[P51]  started to describe it online, it seems, as a failing nation. What's your view? Well, I'm glad you asked me about Elon Musk, because the thing that I love most about the media having this massive meltdown about, oh, no, these Americans are interfering in our political... These are the same media commentators who are constantly banging on about American politics and saying, Donald Trump needs to do this, you need to vote for this. Like, all of this stuff is ridiculous. The reality is we download our culture, our politics, 
[P52]  almost everything from America, right? America has become what Britain used to be, which is the center of Western civilization. And my request and ask and begging of British people is, if we're going to download American culture and politics, let's at least take the good stuff instead of all this terrible woke shit that we downloaded from them, the DEI and all this other nonsense, and actually take the entrepreneurial spirit and all these other things that are really great about America, the optimism, 
[P53]  the positivity, the willingness to have a go, to take a risk, as Scott was talking about. So I wish we took more of that. And it speaks to your question about are we a failing nation? Look, I think it's a deliberately inflammatory question, which I don't want to kind of actually accept in that way. But what I think we should acknowledge is are we trending up or are we trending down? And when you talk about over 10,000 millionaires, 
[P54]  have left. I hear that through a normal British person's ear. And I worry that there's quite a lot of British people who will hear that and say, oh, good, all of these rich parasites have left. Because that's our attitude in the UK to a very large extent. We see wealthy people not as what they are, which is for the most part, not everybody, but for the most part, people who've created a tremendous amount of value for their fellow human beings. And as a result of that, 
[P55]  have been rewarded. We see them because we, you know, we have this history of the landed gentry. And so to us, a millionaire is someone who has these ill-gotten gains that they don't deserve, right? That is not really the world we live in. When I talk to wealthy people in this country and pretty much everywhere else, for the most part, especially in the Western world, these are people who've created something that has fundamentally helped other human beings do something better, do something easier, 
[P56]  products, cheaper, whatever it is. That's who the successful people really are. And we just need an attitude shift. That's what we should be downloading from America. What we should be saying inside our heads is this person is successful because they've helped other people. Great. How do we get more of those people into our country? And I'm afraid I'm telling you something that you know better than anyone, Stephen. If you don't have entrepreneurs in your country creating businesses and creating jobs, 
[P57]  eternity. We have to get smart, talented, driven people into our country instead of chasing them out. Dan, I know this is a subject that you're very passionate about, and Konstantin's articulated it really, really well. I've seen lots of your posts about this subject, Dan. What are you seeing? And is it true that the British attitude is a form of self-harm that's holding us back from our potential? There are definitely attitudinal factors, but you'll also get the most incredibly entrepreneurial people here in London. London is a melting pot for

[P128]  it properly, although there were individual members of the cabinet that tried to do something like Sir Le Braverman. But he's putting pressure on the government of the day. You can see him going after Nigel Farage, of all people, and saying Nigel Farage is not the right leader for reform. So he's attempting to shape British politics in the direction that he feels is the right way. What does he want? What outcome does he want? Look, I don't know what Elon Musk wants. I don't know him personally. I haven't even yet had a chance 
[P129]  to interview him, which I really look forward to doing, because I think he's one of the great visionaries of our time. Whether you like him or not, I think that's undeniably true. But my sense is he's trying to talk about all the things that we've been discussing, freedom of expression, the end of identity politics and the pursuit of meritocracy, a pioneering, inspiring vision of the future, which is why he's talking about Mars and a vision for our civilization that goes beyond the narrow squabbling 
[P130]  here on Earth. And the understanding that human beings are meant, we left the cave. We're not supposed to stay in a place with the walls closing in on us and feel like we're in decline. We're not supposed to be a civilization that has 1.5 children per woman and that is simply just leaving the planet Earth because we can't reproduce. We're supposed to look at the future with hope and optimism. We're supposed to say, 
[P131]  I want things to be better for my children. I want to have children. I want the vision of our society being one of positivity and optimism and a sense of a pioneering vision and inspiration. That's what I think he wants. And I don't really see any of that in the current government in the UK. And I think he's right to go after them and say, you are destroying your country's economy. You're destroying its culture. You're destroying its sense of cohesiveness by allowing illegal immigration. 
[P132]  You are destroying that sense of optimism and vision. And you're not saying to people, let's build something better. You're saying, let's stay small. Let's play small. Let's not rise above our station. And I think we need people like that, imperfect as they may be in all sorts of different ways, to drive our civilization forward, to say to us, there is an inspiring vision to which we're all moving, as opposed to just sitting there and waiting to die, which is what we've been doing for far too long. 
[P133]  I think Elon is taking him at his word. You know, he said a year ago that he was going to absolutely dismantle the woke mind virus globally and he was going to ensure meritocracy and free speech. And when he sets his mind on something, he has the ability to stay focused on it for a very long time to a degree most people can't fathom. You know, and he's absolutely willing to endure pain. He loves a fight. He obviously has the kind of mind that can't relax unless he's kind of grinding up against some gear. 
[P134]  as well. Like the way he works needs stress in his life. He needs a big enemy. He needs a big fight to engage with. And I think Keir Starmer just ticked all of his boxes as someone to go up against. I think what's interesting is we talk about these big tech. I love that Scott has previously talked about breaking up big tech. And I think there's potential for that in the next four years. All of these guys like Trump and JD Vance and all of them have locked horns with big tech. 
[P135]  and they've come, you know, this is their chance to get revenge on big tech in the next four years. They could do a little, you know, you might see Google have to, you know, spin off YouTube or you might see AWS have to come away from Amazon or something like that. Who knows? But it's interesting that a lot of these big tech guys, they're probably cozying up to Trump because, you know, that could be on the cards as well. There's been a lot of Trump butt kissing over the last couple of weeks. 
[P136]  bragged about the fact that everybody's flown down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss his butt and to cozy up with him. And there's now headlines saying that there's this tech oligarchy forming in the United States where Bezos and Elon and Zuck are all now friends and they're stood behind Trump as this unifying force. Just to touch on a few points of that, but also on Constantine's message that Elon is doing this for the betterment of humanity, to further humanity, his involvement with the UK, but his broader involvement in politics now. Scott, does that square with how you think about Elon? 
[P137]  And I am quite curious to ask you why you made the decision to leave X and to go to Blue Sky and Threads and things like that. Yeah, I can't speculate on what motivates Elon Musk. I quite frankly just don't get the guy. And I don't have the domain expertise to comment on the rape gangs. It's such a serious, upsetting issue. I don't know it well enough to speak intelligently to it. Just the topic of censorship, though, as it relates to meta,

[P20]  left lost its way in your view? And if so, how did that happen? And just to respond on some of Constantine's points about Trump being the best of a sort of right-wing collective, are we going to see right-wing sort of ideology spread throughout the Western world over the coming years? What's your take on all of the above? You definitely, you know, we Democrats, we get it right and then we just go too damn far. And so I look at, I'm a professor on a campus, 
[P21]  DEI, 60 years ago, there were 12 black people at Princeton, Yale, and Harvard combined. That was a problem. Race-based affirmative action makes sense. This year, more than half of Harvard's freshman class identifies as non-white. But 70% of those non-whites come from dual-income homes in the upper quintile of income-earning homes. The academic gap between black and white used to be double what it was between rich and poor. It's now flipped. So DEI was a good idea that, quite frankly, has gone insane 
[P22]  system it was trying to do away with. And then we created two candidates who were the only candidates who could make each other viable. Vice President Harris, given the hand she dealt with, did the best she did. I think President Biden should be buried in a crypt entitled narcissist who decided that it made sense for him to go back on his pledge to be a transition candidate and gave us a British-style election timing on the Democratic side in a marketplace. 
[P23]  or you need time and money. So it was not, we did not have a great candidate. There is an understandable swing back from what is an overcorrection around some of these issues. You know, parents, we gave them a huge issue with transgender rights. There's more Padel players in California than transgender people. And yet the Democrats decided to conflate it with the civil rights movement and think that it was okay for a woman who transitioned, a transgender woman, 
[P24]  enter a bicycle race and finish five minutes before everybody else, and then we all bark up the same tree and decide that it's inspiring. And parents all over the nation are saying, we've literally gone crazy. Where I would disagree a little bit with Constantine is that America choosing economic growth and prosperity, there are 190 sovereign nations in the world. 189 would change places with America over the last four years. We hit 71 new record highs in the markets, 97% of all AI. We've created more market capitalization 
[P25]  in a seven-mile radius of SFO International Airport than Europe's created in the last 20 years. We have the lowest inflation in the G7. We have the highest growth. We've grown 10% since 2020. That's triple the rate of Europe. Biden was unable to communicate any of that effectively because there's this psychological dynamic that when your wages go up, you credit your own grit and character, and when the price of cereal goes up, you blame the president. Now, similar to the future, or how William Gibson described the future, 
[P26]  It's here. It's just not evenly distributed. Prosperity is unprecedented in the U.S. over the last four years. It just wasn't evenly distributed. Now, having said that, in America, you can stop working in August and you've produced more and made more money than you have in Europe the whole year. And it has gotten better. It says things are less bad than anywhere in the world in the U.S. Biden was unable to communicate it. And then talking about how great the economy is when rents were skyrocketing, tuition was going up, it was an ineffective strategy. 
[P27]  But I don't think it's fair to say Americans chose prosperity. We have prosperity.

输入内容：
[P101]  Right now, when I talk about masculinity, you know, there's if I say at a conference, oh, women are better managers. Everyone goes, yes, that's right. That's right. Right. That's OK. If I say men are more risk aggressive and make better entrepreneurs, you're a misogynist. You're out. And the reality is men and women bring different attributes. But the masculinity and femininity, I think masculinity is a wonderful thing. I think we need a different image of it. I think people born as male have an easier time leaning into those things. 
[P102]  I work out at CrossFit with a bunch of lesbian firefighters. They bring great masculine energy, and they could carry my ass out of a fire. So a lot of men demonstrate wonderful feminine qualities. A lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculine qualities. I don't think these things are sequestered to anyone born as a specific gender. What I think, when I talk about masculinity, I don't talk about it in the role of corporations. I think that's as fraught with risk and not worth talking about. It should be about shareholder value or stakeholder value. 
[P103]  I think young men need a code. We're going to church less. We have fewer relationships. So what's the code you hold on to in terms of creating behaviors that are productive for you, yourself, society? And I think masculinity needs to be redefined as something more aspirational where you're celebrated for being really fucking strong. You're celebrated for not complaining. You're celebrated for creating surplus value. You create more tax revenue than you absorb. You're celebrated for being aggressive. You're celebrated for breaking up fights at bars. 
[P104]  not starting them. You're celebrated for protecting your country, not shitposting it. You're celebrated for approaching strange women and expressing romantic interest. That's not a crime. And if she's not interested and you're rejected, you're both going to be fine. You're celebrated for getting out of the house. You're celebrated for working. You're celebrated for making money and liking money. I think there just needs to be a redefinition of masculinity in the context of helping young men 
[P105]  code that they used to get from the armed services or from dual parent households. And I feel like they're struggling. So I like the idea of something that they feel in their bones and in their body and in their DNA that they can lean into that we celebrate. And the conversation is flipped entirely. Five years ago, I was called a misogynist for talking about masculinity. Now the conversation is being led and advocated by one group, and it's mothers who are like, 
[P106]  My son is not doing well. I got three kids, two daughters, daughters in PR with the other ones at Penn, and my son is in the basement vaping and playing video games. He needs something to latch on to. He needs a code. Anyways, but I apologize. Word salad. Zuckerberg and masculinity, give me a fucking break. He looks like a Chechen Molly dealer. Sorry, back to you, Stephen. Well, it's interesting when you speak, Scott, because your views on masculinity 
[P107]  me to be most better represented by the right side of politics than the left side of politics. They both have their own vision of masculinity. And yours seems to be a Republican view of masculinity. To Trump's credit, he saw the opportunity and he flew right into the manosphere. Rockets, crypto, Joe Rogan, Theo Vaughn. He said, no, I'm not going to run from this. I'm going to fly right into it. Now, I would argue that his vision of masculinity has too much 
[P108]  coarseness, too much cruelty, too much bullying. I don't think that's masculinity. I think when we talk about Elon Musk taking risks, sending rockets that are captured by scissors coming down, inspiring the EV race, taking an enormous risk, making a shit ton of money. Yeah, that's a great form of masculinity. Accusing men trying to save high soccer players, calling them pedophiles, calling your employees a sex criminal such that they have to leave their house, having 13 kids by five women or three women, none of which you live with, 
[P109]  Sleeping next to a loaded gun, losing control of your self-control because of addiction. I don't think that's a great role model. I think it's an amazing role model for boys. I don't think it's a great role model for men. In terms of energy, there are so many reasons why I'm a big matcha fan, if you don't already know by now. And so much so that I actually invested in the UK's leading matcha company called Perfect Ted. And one of my favorite Perfect Ted products is these delicious matcha pouches that come in every flavor from salted caramel, 
[P110]  to peach flavor, to mint flavor, to berry flavor. One of my favorites is this vanilla flavor, which I'm going to make in just two seconds. You just take this mixer here, get a little bit of the powder, pop it on top of the shaker like that. Put the lid on. Shake, shake, shake. Delicious. If you haven't tried this yet, you can find Perfect Ted at Tesco and Holland Barrett stores or online where you can get 40% off with my code, Diary40. 
[P111]  put in code Diary40 to try this delicious multi-flavored matcha now. Highly recommend. And if you do it, please tag me, send me a message online. Do you know that 80% of New Year's resolutions fail by February? It's because we focus too much on the end goal and we forget the small daily actions that actually move us forward. Those actions that are easy to do are also easy not to do in life. It's easy to save a dollar, so it's also easy not to. Making one small improvement each day, one tiny step in the right direction, has a big difference over time. 
[P112]  mindset, which is why we created The 1% Diary, a 90-day journal designed to help you stay consistent and focus on the small wins and make real progress over time. It also gives you access to The 1% Community, a space where you can stay accountable, motivated, inspired, along with many others on the same journey. We launched The 1% Diary in November and it sold out. So now we're doing a second drop. Head to thediary.com to grab yours before it sells out again. I'll put the link below. 
[P113]  Censorship. The word censorship was used there by Scott. We've seen this reversal in Meta's attitude, Facebook's attitude that had been built up over a decade, where it almost felt like if you had sort of right-leaning views or really any unaccepted views and you posted those on Facebook, you would face maybe having the post deleted or your account suspended. This new world of speech, of free speech, and as it pertains to masculinity. 
[P114]  noticed, Scott, you'd left X. You no longer post or tweet on X anymore. Do you think Elon's decision to buy X is a net positive for society? Net, yes. But I think what people hear when you say that is there's no problems with this system than, you know, compared to the ones we had before. There are definitely disadvantages to a free platform like X now. And one of them is 
[P115]  inevitably when you remove censorship, one of the things the censorship was doing was keeping all the deeply unpleasant people away from being able to shove things in your face. And that happens quite a lot on it. So I don't enjoy that aspect of it. But I've always said that would be the price that we would pay for freedom. Freedom always has a price, and that's what we're seeing. As for Zuckerberg, his miraculous transformation into a free speech warrior 
[P116]  And I'm delighted to welcome him. I'm sure it's entirely genuine and not anything to do with the election results we've just seen in any way whatsoever. And the fact that the culture shifted and those of us who were being censored by people like him for years actually winning the argument. Well, what it shows you is we've won the argument on free speech when it comes to the big tech platforms. And it's going to be messy. 
[P117]  that are algorithmically driven, where the truth and the moderate reasonable take is not what usually gets attention, you're going to see a lot of unpleasantness. I value the ability to hear and communicate truthful ideas and facts over my own subjective feelings. Oh, someone said a thing I don't like or someone was racist or someone was misogynistic. I don't enjoy the fact that that happens.

输入内容：
[P43]  bullish on the UK versus the US from an entrepreneur's perspective? So the question I get most frequently when I speak here is to compare and contrast the US with the UK. And I use a personal anecdote. My parents immigrated to the US from Glasgow and London when they were 19 and 22. They took enormous risks. I've been an entrepreneur my whole life. I like to think that a lot of my success isn't my fault, that I inherited sort of that risk-taking DNA. And when I speak to people in the UK, I say the primary difference is 
[P44]  And that is, it kind of comes down to a risk appetite. The U.S. has five times per capita the number of entrepreneurs. It has five times the dollar volume per startup. There's $5 million in venture capital waiting to be deployed for every startup in the U.S. versus $1 million in Europe. I love what Constantine said about a restaurant. I went into this great little restaurant in Soho a few weeks ago called Dig In, and I loved it so much. I left my card and said, can you have the owner? 
[P45]  I'd like to open another one. Does he need money? I just would never do that here. I thought that was a really interesting insight. And the collision of risk, crazy ideas that occasionally become crazy genius and technology and intellectual property and great universities results in a company that no one had heard of five years ago being worth more than the entire UK stock market, NVIDIA. So there's just an enormous difference. 
[P46]  my impression of the UK economy, I'll just say London. I have no experience in it. I don't go anywhere that's not walking distance from Marlebone. So my bubble is pretty opaque. But the way I would describe the economy here is I love the term the butler economy. And that is all the money I see being made here is people servicing wealth created somewhere else. You're either in financial services servicing rich people. You're either opening a restaurant or hospitality. 
[P47]  quality servicing rich people, but I don't see a lot of organic wealth creation. I interviewed the two, quote unquote, inventors of AI at one of your prestigious universities. My first question is, how the hell were you not able to make any money if you invented AI? Why haven't you been able to capture any money? But just for your listeners, my summation of Europe versus the US after molesting the earth for the last 35 years is US is still the best place to make money and Europe is still the best place to spend it. Is this a failing nation, Scott? 
[P48]  I think you have too much going for you to be described as a failing nation. You still have amazing universities. London's still the second best city in the world. Premier League, it's an unbelievable export. I know how ridiculous that sounds. People want to be here. There's still rule of law, rule of play. You still produce amazing rock and roll. I just don't see how you could say this is a failed. I would argue that second only to our entry into Iraq, 
[P49]  An American can't understand why you would decide to increase your prices while reducing productivity in one fell swoop. It's difficult for us to wrap our heads around some of the economic decisions the UK has made. But I think a lot of people are kind of betting or hoping that the UK begins to grow again. So in a weird way, I would call myself cautiously optimistic about the UK. I think at some point it registers.

主题：美国社会文化经济转型讨论

输入内容：
[P5]  It feels to me that the world is at a real moment of transition in many regards. So like social transition, cultural transition, economic transition. And I think the US has been a catalyst for all of that. So that's why I wanted to have this conversation today. We've got an American here, Scott. I think Scott's the only American here. We've got Constantine. We've got Daniel, who are two Brits, but spend a lot of time between America as well. And so I want to come to Scott first and ask Scott a question, which is a very big, broad question, 
[P6]  your perspective, Scott, you know, when I talk about this feeling of transition, that seems to be like almost inside my chest, that we're at a really historic moment. What is your analysis on this? What is the big picture here? What's happened over the last three, four, five, six, seven months? And how is that going to impact all of us around the world? Well, if you think of the US as setting the tone economically, and maybe even culturally for the West, there's definitely a reversion away from 
[P7]  people feel that quote-unquote wokeism, and I don't like to use that word, but I'll use it here, was this sort of overcorrection to systemic racism and that it began to cause more damage than it was or cause more problems than it was solving. And I think there's been a serious kind of lurch back, if you will, whether it's executive actions declaring the border, a state of emergency, stuff around saying that gender is a thing, 
[P8]  and female. And most of these issues, the actually American public supports, I would say on a more cynical level, America used to be a platform for prosperity, the protection of civil rights, the projection of women's rights and power and democracy abroad. And I would argue that it feels like a pretty quick transition to almost like a, you know, I call it a kleptocracy, but America has become a platform for 
[P9]  acquiring wealth and then leveraging that wealth as a means or a proxy of power. And the ultimate example of that was the launch of two meme coins, the Trump coin and the Melania coin, the day before the presidency, such that this conversation could have already or might happen this week. And I'll finish here. President Trump, it's Vlad. We're thinking about stabilizing our currency or trying to send the outflows of our reserves. 
[P10]  into the Trump coin, which, based on my economist estimation, would take the value of it to a $20 or $30 billion market cap, making you one of the wealthiest men in the world, Mr. Trump. And none of this would be disclosable or transparent. Also, in unrelated news, we'd really appreciate you seizing arms shipments to Ukraine. So I think we've gone kind of full kleptocracy is the way I would describe it. Are you optimistic, Scott? Well, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy.

主题：美国政治与社会议题的复杂性

输入内容：
[P11]  I don't know if I'm just getting older, but no, I don't see a man convicted of sexual abuse or found liable who inspired an insurrection retaking the White House as a point of light for the American experience. Constantine, I suspect you'd have a slightly different view on all of the above. How are you feeling about everything that happened yesterday? Did you watch the inauguration? What is your big picture, 30,000 feet view? 
[P12]  make bold predictions about what's going to happen over the next six to seven months. I do think what America had at the election and what the election of Donald Trump represents is something that we in the UK don't have, which is choice. They had a very clear choice between two very different perspectives on the world, between two very different approaches, between two very different candidates. And ultimately, criticisms of President Trump are necessary and legitimate. Of course they are. 
[P13]  But at the end of the day, I believe having spent quite a lot of time in America around election time and also just generally and traveling around real America, not just in D.C. and L.A. and New York. The reason that he was elected was that the American people are not prepared to accept what Europeans have decided they're prepared to accept, which is managed decline. The American people do not want their country to become weaker. They do not want it to become poorer. 
[P14]  impoverish their fellow citizens through net zero. What they want is their country to be great, their country to be powerful, their country to be influential. The economic realities for most Americans are not really reflected in the figures that we are told. So when people talk about inflation, the reality of people's lives on the ground is that their cost of living has gone up very, very significantly over the last few years. 
[P15]  overall inflation figure that we're shown because certain things are much more influential in people's lives than others. And so whether the decision to elect President Trump ends up being this positive thing for which there should be lots of optimism is a matter of the next four years. Are we going to see a presidency that really does everything it promises? And by the way, you know, if you look at the things that Donald Trump is promising, 
[P16]  Whether you're left or right, you have to acknowledge that they are things that are worth doing. Having a secure border so that people don't come into your country illegally is a basic duty of government. Economic prosperity is a basic duty of government. Withdrawing America from a kind of simultaneously aggressive but weak posture around the world where America sort of says, yeah, yeah, we're going to get involved in these foreign conflicts, 
[P17]  win that war is a kind of stupid position on both whichever side you're on. So on all of these things, and of course, you know, Scott mentioned wokeness. I think he's absolutely right that there is a massive backlash happening around the world because lots and lots of people who were completely apolitical until the last three or four years or maybe until 2016 just feel like the world has gone crazy and suddenly they're supposed to pretend that men can change sex and become women and now they're 
[P18]  entitled to be in female prisons. And, you know, if your teenager says that they are the opposite sex, you're supposed to chop their breasts off and all of this other stuff that ordinary people just look at and go, this is crazy. Like, I am liberal, but this isn't liberal. This is some kind of weird thing that's going on. And I see the backlash against all of that all over the Western world. And I think Donald Trump signifies that people are fed up of that. 
[P19]  that if the woke left continues to exercise this level of influence on our public debate, the reaction will be the rise of the right. And Donald Trump is one of the most diplomatic and pleasant versions of what you're likely to get if the left keeps going crazy. We will see what challenges the world throws at him over the next four years and whether he's capable of responding to them.

输入内容：
[P118]  but I would rather that happened and also we were not being censored from saying, you know, COVID probably came from a lab in China, which we were. You know, the Hunter Biden laptop story isn't Russian disinformation. Actually, it's an important piece of information that American voters need to hear when they're making their decision about the election. And all of these other things that were being suppressed and censored across social media for years, they're not anymore. 
[P119]  that's a good thing. And I think that's helpful. And if you look at, you know, to bring it back to the UK for a moment, Stephen, as you know, on Trigonometry, we've tried to cover the grooming gangs scandal and is an outrage what happened in this country over decades. We've been covering that for years, since about 2019, 2020, to very little purchase. And one of the reasons is it was just something that the media sort of covered and then moved on, when it actually should have been something we talked about on 
[P120]  daily basis until serious action was taken. And we saw real, real change, real change in policing, real change in social work, real change in government, real change in the way that these racially aggravated hate crimes were treated. Well, none of that was really being talked about seriously until Elon kicked up a fuss, amplified the voices of survivors, amplified the voices of campaigners on X, which he bought. And now the British government is forced 
[P121]  to do whatever it can to actually address those issues to the extent that it will. A lot of people will say it still doesn't go far enough. Well, if it doesn't go far enough, we now have a platform from which we can continue to have that conversation until there is the sort of inquiry and the sort of outcomes that people want to actually deliver real change. So is that a positive? God, yes. God, yes. We needed that. 
[P122]  by someone like Elon Musk on a platform like X, which is now free, to the point where Keir Starmer is forced into defensive action. I wish that was around 30 years ago because a hell of a lot of young girls and women wouldn't have suffered the way they did if we had the opportunity to get that message out. So, God, yes, it's a net positive. Just to pick up on that, Constantine, I've had a question in my mind for a while regarding the scandal, which is horrific, I think it's something we all definitely agree on, is why has Elon chosen 
[P123]  now? And why has he chosen Keir Starmer as the sort of central target of this flurry of tweets around the grooming scandals? Because there's clearly, Elon's, I think, an individual which you can kind of see thinking in real time. Like if you go back through his tweets, because there's so many of them, and they kind of come in these spurts, you can almost see what he's getting at. Is there an underlying reason why he's made this a central issue over the last couple of weeks? 
[P124]  is actually most Americans were completely unaware of this issue until recently. I remember a year ago speaking at a private event in New York and somebody said to me, well, you know, what is the consequence of political correctness? Why are you so against it? Why are you so against censorship? And I talked about the grooming gangs and people were horrified. They hadn't even, and these are well-informed, educated people who are media savvy and whatever. So one of the reasons is I think to a lot of Americans, this issue is only coming to the fore. 
[P125]  now in front of their mind. The second issue, I think, is that Elon Musk understands what I said earlier, which is we have a global Western culture now. And so what happens in Britain matters just as much as what happens in America, because we are symbiotic with each other now. When there's a restriction of speech in the UK, when we have laws about what people are not allowed to say, that has an impact across the world. When you see the European Union trying to pass legislation, 
[P126]  about online censorship. That has an impact because if something exists in the UK and in many European countries, it's only a matter of time before people in America are going to say, well, look, they've got this in Europe. Why don't we bring it over here? And vice versa. So what happens in America affects us in Europe and in the UK. And what happens in Europe and the UK affects America. So what Elon, I think, is trying to do is to say, we care about our civilization. Elon doesn't really talk that much about the United States. 
[P127]  about our civilization as I do, because I believe that we are now one thing to a very significant extent. Now, from our civilizational point of view, is it a good thing that mass rape gangs in the UK are being insufficiently investigated and treated improperly by the police and the government? No, it's not. It's a very bad thing. So how do we address that? Well, we address that by putting pressure on the government of the day. Now, I don't see the grooming gangs as a party political issue.

主题：英国经济与企业家精神挑战

输入内容：
[P28]  My favorite appointment in the Trump administration in the adult room is the 10 year bond, which is going to say, sorry, girlfriend, when I believe the president tries to implement some of these economic policies. Constantine, is that true? Because what I heard there is that effectively Trump had a better marketing campaign. And that reality is somewhat different from what the Americans were sold in the last election cycle. Well, politics is about marketing and Trump is the marketer in chief. 
[P29]  and partly that's what politics is about. But in terms of the economy, I think Scott is entirely right. It's one of the reasons I admire America so much, the sense of dynamism and economic growth and the desire to create things and build things. It's an observation I've had every time I've been there. You know, if you have a successful restaurant in the UK, you go, well, I've got a successful restaurant. In America, if you have a successful restaurant, you open a second one and a third one and you create a chain, right? So their attitude to business more broadly is, 
[P30]  is fantastic and I love it. But I think the difference is that I don't think Americans were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the European economies. They were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the American economy under Donald Trump in his first term and also what they expect him to do for the future. When they look at the fact that he's got real business leaders in government now, like Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk talking about government efficiency, 
[P31]  all Western countries have a massively bloated civil service, what we call civil service in the UK and the administrative state in the US that wastes a huge amount of money, that produces very little in terms of output in many cases. And that needs to be slimmed down. And people, I think, are very excited about that. And when I talk to business leaders in America, including ones that were never on the Trump train, so to speak, so many of them went over to his side in this election cycle. 
[P32]  because they just felt that he was going to continue to accelerate American growth and continue to deliver prosperity for the American people. Now, Scott's point about tariffs and all of these other things, you know, I've listened to Donald Trump enough now to know that you should not necessarily be taking him literally. I think many of the things he says are negotiation tactics and signaling. 
[P33]  build this or do that or do this. You have to sort of read between the lines when he says, you know, this will be the worst thing that you just go. He's saying to people like, you better work with me. Otherwise, this is going to work out badly for you on all of these things. And so it remains to be seen whether he's successful in those tactics of getting what he wants. Look, America is always going to be an unequal society. It's designed in a way that is going to make it that way. In America, the focus is how do we grow the pie? 
[P34]  In Europe, the focus is how do we divide it up so everyone gets their fair little share, right? So Americans are about expanding the pie and then the people who bake the pie get as much of it as they possibly can. But the question is, can there be a sense in America that the American dream is alive, that you do not have to work three gig economy jobs to pay your rent, that you're going to be able to buy a house, that you're going to be able to afford to have children, 
[P35]  raise a family, perhaps on a single income, something that most people only dream about nowadays. That's really what this whole economic conversation is about. And we will see over the next four years if Donald Trump is able to slightly even change the direction of travel towards those things that actually Americans of my generation and older used to take for granted as the promise of the country that they live in. I've thought a lot about this over the last couple of weeks in particular, 
[P36]  papers in the UK that millionaires are leaving the UK in historic numbers. I think it's 10,800 millionaires left last year, which is an increase of about 160% versus the previous year. And the general sentiment in terms of business confidence in the UK is at a several year low. So I think it's the lowest it's been since just post pandemic. There's this, I think it's the Institute of Accountants, they call up 1000 accountants every year, and they get they run a survey to see how much confidence 
[P37]  they have in business in this country. And it's fallen 14 points to 0.2% confidence in terms of business. But there's this bigger narrative emerging amongst my entrepreneurial friends that if you want to start a business right now, the best place to be in the world is to be in America, is to get over to America and to leave the UK. Now, Dan, how does that score? I know you have an accelerator, you speak to lots of entrepreneurs. How does that sort of compare or contrast with what you're seeing at the moment? Yeah, 100%. The value proposition for the UK has dropped through the floor. 
[P38]  Very, very high tax. The ecosystem of business is in decline. Some of the smartest people are now in Dubai. Some incredible creators that I know have moved to Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai. Many are going to the USA. So if people are interested in bigger markets and bigger opportunities, they're into the USA. If they're interested in lower tax and more fringe opportunities, they're in the Middle East. 
[P39]  a place in the world. I think there are three business models the UK could go for, which is either the head office of Europe, which is what we were when we were inside the EU, and everyone used to come here to build a European business. We could be the back office of the USA, so the incubator for the USA. A lot of smart companies get to their first 50 million of value here in the UK and then sell to a US private equity firm or US listed company. 
[P40]  And a lot of US companies are now actually coming here to poach talent or to outsource things to the UK more cheaply than they could do it in the US. The wages in the UK are through the floor compared to what you would pay in the US, especially in tech roles. So very smart people in the UK are massively devalued. 
[P41]  tax, model of Dubai, Singapore, you know, those kind of options. So we haven't really picked one of those three yet. We're still, you know, all these years after Brexit, and we haven't said which of those three models we want to adopt. Scott, you moved here a couple of years ago to the UK. And despite everything that's going on in the UK, are you still bullish on this being a place for entrepreneurship and business? I was looking at some stats 
[P42]  of key areas of concern for me. Business stats I've talked about there, the drop in business confidence, the entrepreneur exodus that we're seeing, but things like knife crime in the UK are up 81% over the last decade, which I think is a symptom probably of something else. And one of the big things I think a lot about as an entrepreneur at the moment is artificial intelligence. And our investment in artificial intelligence from a global perspective is down about 2000% versus a country like America. So you've moved here, you've brought your family here.

主题：男性社会角色与心理健康问题

输入内容：
[P58]  creativity. You've got sitting in one city, you've got people who are phenomenal at media, finance, technology, entertainment, politics, defense, like all of this. Like if you take the best of LA and Washington and New York and Miami and kind of start moving it into one city, you know, you get elements of that in London. It's a very diverse city from that point of view, and it creates an entrepreneurial melting pot. The issue is taxes. Nobody wants to pay 
[P59]  60% of their income in taxes. And as soon as you hit, you know, in the US, you don't hit the top tax rate until you are six times the average wage. Here in the UK, it's two and a half times. So as soon as you're two and a half times the average wage, you're in real trouble. There are so many people in the UK who deliberately hold their income at £50,000 because after £50,000, you get taxed 40% of your income. So people just give up and they say, I'm not going, I know some 
[P60]  really smart, really talented people who could be earning a lot more and they refuse to pay the 40% rate. So they like keep everything small because they don't want to go from 20 to 40% at the 50 grand rate, which is crazy. And I've employed people who have said, can I have a day off a week rather than going over that threshold? So, you know, that's a huge issue, the tax issue. The company rate tax is high. The corporate capital gains rate is taxed very high. The VAT is high. 
[P61]  The council tax is high. All of these additional taxes just keep piling up. And then the other cost at the moment, if we want to have an AI economy, we need cheap electricity. One thing that Trump has committed to is really, really cheap energy. There is no such thing as a fast growth, high octane economy that has expensive energy. Cheap energy equals fast growth. And we have the most expensive energy in the world. 
[P62]  Scott, you look like a lot of thoughts are going through your head following those two comments. What are you thinking? 
[P63]  that we have a housing crisis and that the executive order should have been around that. Just going back to the U.S., and I'm curious of the same dynamics and whether Constantine and Daniel agree with us. I believe this, the election in the U.S. was supposed to be a referendum on women's rights. Women's rights did not show up. This was a referendum on young men, in my view. And that is, if you look at the two cohorts that swung most from blue to red versus 2020, two of the three cohorts, other than Latinos, 
[P64]  was people under the age of 30 who in the U.S. are 24% less wealthy than they were 40 years ago, people over the age of 70 or 72% wealthier. Our tax code is basically an attempt to shove money from the young to the old. And two, 45 to 64-year-old women who I would affectionately describe as their mother. And that is when your son's in the basement vaping and playing video games, and I think a lot about struggling young men, you don't give a flying fuck about territorial sovereignty in the Ukraine, or Ukraine, excuse me, or transgender rights. 
[P65]  is your kid isn't doing well. And 210 times a day, your kid's getting a notification that somebody he knows is on a Gulfstream or partying in St. Bart's and it's not him or her. And so we not only have young people not doing as well, this pornographic wealth is just shoved in their face. And you end up with, in my opinion, kind of a young, struggling young man. No group has fallen further faster in the world, I would argue, than young men in America. 
[P66]  a morgue in the United States and there's five people who died by suicide, four of them are men. One in three men under the age of 30 has a girlfriend. Two in three women under the age of 30 has a boyfriend. Why? You think that's mathematically impossible? Because women are dating older because they want more economically and emotionally viable men. There's one in five men live at home at the age of 30. One in three under the age of 25. They're not having sex. They're more obese. They're more depressed. When women don't have a relationship, they oftentimes channel that energy 
[P67]  into their professional lives. More single women own homes in the U.S. than single men. Women in urban areas under the age of 30 are making more money than men. When men don't have the guardrails of a relationship or a job or being in school, they pour that energy sometimes into unproductive things, misogyny, nationalism or extreme nationalism, conspiracy theory. In some, they become really shitty citizens. They become sequestered from society. So I'm worried in the U.S., our biggest threat is a new species of asexual. 
[P68]  asocial young men who are incredibly dangerous have opted out of America. 60% of 30-year-olds used to have one child in America, and that's 27%. So people, I think, in the U.S., and this is a genuine question. I don't know if it's the same problem here. Our tax policies have taken money from the young, stuffed them in the pockets of old people so Nana and Pop-Pop can upgrade from Carnival to Crystal Cruises. Meanwhile, young people can't afford education. They can't afford housing. 
[P69]  And we especially see this really acute emerging crisis among young men who are just opting out of America, who don't even want to try and date, don't even want to enroll in school, don't want to even try and get a job, just stick in their basements and go on Reddit or Discord, or why go try and shower or work out and get a relationship when you have you porn? Why get a job when you can trade stocks or crypto on Coinbase or Robinhood? 
[P70]  In my opinion, this is the most dangerous trend in America right now. It was almost like demonizing men for decades has consequences. I mean, this is what's been happening. Men are the root of all evil, the root of all evil, the root of all evil. Every advert is about, you know, the woman is strong and capable. The guy's pathetic. In every movie, the woman's kicking ass and the man is pathetic. This has been going on for decades. It's a cultural thing as well as an economic thing. 
[P71]  meaning and opportunity away from men. If you create an education system that punishes boys for being boys, if you create a society in which traditional masculine virtues become vices, then you will create exactly the sort of thing that Scott is talking about. It's a terrible thing that's been done. Having said that, my message is always the same to young men who I hope are listening, which is the answer to your problems is never going to be, as Scott says, porn and this and that. 
[P72]  the answer to your problems is going to take responsibility, go out and get a job or create a business and actually make your life better. No one's coming to save you. No one's coming to help you. There is no, the sort of programs that we have for women where we sort of go, well, you know, let's give them an opportunity here. None of that's happening for men. It's not going to happen because for evolutionary reasons, we just don't feel sorry for men the way that we do for women. That's a reality. I know it sucks, 
[P73]  men is going to be the answer that's always been the answer for men, which is for you to get off the sofa, to get off the couch and go out and actually do and create and build and find your own way through it. Even if you have to acknowledge that the society you live in has been conditioned for quite a long time to think that you're a piece of shit because you happen to have the genitalia that you do. Now, that I think is the harsh reality of it. And I think Scott is right to point this out as a problem. And I hope that we start to have 
[P74]  both in terms of economic policy, but in terms of also just the cultural conversations and the way we talk about these issues, we come back to something that human beings have known through the entire history of our species, which is men and women are both good and need to work together in order to thrive and succeed together, in order to have families, in order to have children, and in order for us to have healthy communities and healthy societies. You need healthy femininity and you need healthy masculinity, and they need to come together and work together.

[P75]  Together, that's what we're supposed to do. And these stupid gender wars and this idea that men as a group are this and women as a group are that, all of that just needs to end. I was watching last night as Trump sat there signing all of those executive orders. And I also watched his inauguration speak where he said, we will forge a society that is colourblind and merit-based. And he signed a bunch of executive orders last night to eliminate a variety of different DEI programmes in the federal government, 
[P76]  We've seen 
[P77]  whack DEI measures. So I think there's a lot of nuance here. I would argue in universities, DEI is used as a giant misdirect from people such as myself who are enforcers of the caste system and wake up every morning and look in the mirror and ask ourselves the same question. How do I increase my compensation while decreasing my accountability? And what I found is the ultimate strategy is to create an LVMH rejectionist bullshit, elitist strategy, where Dartmouth sits on a 
[P78]  endowment of $8 billion and lets in 500 kids. So the conversation around who gets in is a misdirect from the important question that is how many. If you are not growing your endowment or your freshman class faster than population, you should lose your tax-free status. We should be letting in more gay kids, more trans kids, more white Republicans from rural state. You know who doesn't talk about DEI? Junior colleges, because there's no admissions. They don't have a problem with DEI. 
[P79]  own tail, started out with the right idea. Now it's nothing. And I would argue the same is somewhat true of the Democratic Party. I went to the Democratic National Convention. On the dnc.org website, it lists 17 special introscripts, and it says explicitly who we serve, Asian Pacific Islanders, seniors, veterans, Black Americans, the disabled. It basically lists, I added this up, 76% of the population. And when you say you're actively advocating for 76% 
[P80]  of the population. You're not advocating for 76% of the population. You're discriminating against the 24%. It's gone too far. I would argue in the workplace, having served on seven public company boards, and I'm going to do a lot of boasting here because I'm desperate for all of your affirmation, and 12 private company boards, there's still work to be done in the private sector. There still is a cycle. 40% of all venture capitalists and probably 70% or 80% of all venture capital deployed 
[P81]  are white guys from just two universities, Stanford and Harvard. So I would argue universities, it's gotten out of control. I'd love to see the DEI apparatus disassembled, along with the ethics department, the sustainability department, the leadership department. These are all bullshit where we hire formerly important people with no standards. They never get fired. It just translates to more student debt. In the boardroom, in corporations, in certain sectors, I do think there is a need to be thoughtful about broadening the aperture of the lens 
[P82]  people who are underrepresented. There's still a dearth of women raising venture capital. So I think it's nuanced based on sector. But to just say all DEI is bad, I want to move to where the University of California did in 1997. They don't have race-based affirmative action. They have adversity-based affirmative action. I'm a beneficiary of affirmative action. I had something called Pell Grants. I was raised by a single immigrant mother who lived and died as secretary. So I got grants. I had 
[P83]  unfair advantage because I came from a household that was low income. And I think that there should be affirmative action. And I think it should be based on color, but that color is green. The poor need our help. The moment you start advocating for a special advantage based on any external factors, I think at this point in our society, it probably causes more problems than it solves. That's exactly right. That's exactly right, Stephen. 
[P84]  take a step back and look at why DEI has become such a big part of the conversation, it's precisely because instead of addressing the reality of people's lives, which is some people are disadvantaged and some people are advantaged, actually what we've mainly done, and Scott alluded to at the very beginning of our discussion, is we've given a leg up to very wealthy ethnic minority people from successful families, and they now, their children now get into 
[P85]  prestigious universities, which they probably would have done anyway, some of them, because they come from very advanced backgrounds. And the kids that are growing up in poverty, black and white, have no shot whatsoever. But the reason that it's become such a big issue around the Western world, actually, I don't think it's the nuances that we've delved into here, but actually something else, which is we have created the most ethnically diverse societies in history. And what I mean by that is, 
[P86]  not that we've created societies in which there are large groups of people who are different from each other, but for the first time probably in human history, we've created societies in which there is a lot of ethnic diversity and there is no overt discrimination against some groups of people in the sense of, you know, the imperial societies in the past would have had one dominant ethnic group, which is, you know, the Russians in the Soviet Union or the Turks in the Ottoman Empire 
[P87]  in the British Empire, whatever. That was the ethnic group that was like the dominant one. And everybody else was a kind of second-class citizen and everybody knew it, right? We don't have that anymore. We have highly diverse societies where people of every single background exist in which we have this idea that we're all supposed to be equal. And when we have programs that explicitly discriminate against people, there were times when the discrimination was explicit 
[P88]  black people. Well, we've gone full circle now where the discrimination was going the other way in university admissions, in hiring, in corporate America, in government, in all sorts of things. You know, in this country, the BBC has internships that aren't available to white people, etc. When you get to that point, as Scott said earlier on, everyone just goes, look, I know I'm not supposed to say this, but the reality is this is racism. This is a form of racism. And I thought we were trying to get away from the 
[P89]  So to the extent that the elimination of DEI is about creating a merit-based society in which people are given an opportunity because they're skilled and talented and they have the potential to actually achieve things and create wealth. You know, we all know this. We all employ people, right? How many of us are thinking about the races of the people we hire? I don't think we think about that at all. What we're thinking about is I run a business. I need the very best personable. 
[P90]  very best possible person for this job at the price I'm willing to pay. I don't care if they are purple, green, blue, white, whatever. It doesn't matter. What matters is, are we getting the best person for the job? And my concern about identity politics has always been that if we do not adopt that worldview, then what we will do is create a worldview in which we have different racial groups competing with each other on the basis of race. 
[P91]  very dangerous mix for a multi-ethnic society like ours, which is why I've been begging people to let go of this stupid idea of identity politics and to say, first and foremost, we are all Brits or we are all Americans. We have this umbrella identity under which we all operate and our personal ethnicity or sex or whatever is secondary to that and actually for the purposes of employment, for the purposes of college admission, et cetera, is irrelevant. 
[P92]  Yes, if there is disadvantage, if we grew up in a single-parent home with a low income, we may need some extra support there. If we had terrible schooling or our education was not good, we may need extra support. If there's certain things that make it easier for us because of the disadvantages we've had to fulfill our talent and potential, I am all for that. But what we've created so far, and that's why I'm delighted it's being eliminated, is an anti-meritocratic system which says, 
[P93]  We don't care what you bring to the workplace. We don't care whether you deserve this place or not. We don't care about the potential you have. Actually, we just needed an insert category tick box to fill this slot. And you filled it. It doesn't really matter that you're not doing your job very well because now we can say, you know, we're a diverse company. I don't care about that and we shouldn't care about that as a society. And thank God that's now gone. Yeah, I think the worst part about it too is that it calls into question 
[P94]  and they're from a diverse background, you know, it calls into question why they got that job in the first place, which I think is horrible. You know, I just hired from two candidates, the final two candidates was a guy and a woman. I would hate if the woman felt that she got the job because she's a woman and not because she's best. She turns out she was by far the best in the process. And I would love for her to know that there was absolutely nothing that changed our view. 
[P95]  We weren't trying to fill a position with a woman. We were trying to fill the position with the best, and she should know she was the best. I think the contrast that was really fascinating was between Trump's website and the Democrats' website. So in the Democrats' website, it was who we're for, which was what Scott was saying. But Trump's website was the 20 things we're going to do, and it was just a list of 20. These are the 20 action points. This is what we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this. 
[P96]  as opposed to the identities that we want to advantage list. And I think that was the choice. You know, at the beginning, Constantine, you said, you know, America had a choice. And for me, when I looked at those two websites, I saw this choice between the identities being the main thing or the to-do list being the main thing and very different approaches. Scott, when I was listening to that Zuckerberg interview talking about masculinity and identity issues, one of the lines he said in there, 
[P97]  like something you've said on my show before, where he said, I think having a culture that celebrates that aggression a little bit more, talking about masculinity, has its own merits that are really positive. Now, Mark Zuckerberg isn't necessarily someone that I saw closely aligning to your worldview. Am I right in thinking that that's something you agree with? Because I remember you saying to me, you think people should be able to walk in a room and kick everyone's ass. What I've said on your show is that I think the male form, especially under the age of 30, 
[P98]  with its bone structure, incredible double-twitch muscle, and then this amazing, amazing chemical called testosterone, you're going to look back at your 25-year-old self and think, why wasn't I a fucking monster like Steve Barley? And also, there is some masculinity when Russian soldiers pour over the border in Ukraine. You want some of that big dick energy that Daniel was talking about. In the case of Zuckerberg, 
[P99]  I don't think he really understands an aspirational view of masculinity. I think when he couches immediately kind of trying to kiss Trump's ass because Trump threatened to put him in prison, and what he used to call moderation, he's now calling censorship. And when you have an algorithm that elevates incendiary hateful content, I would not describe that as masculinity. For me, masculinity comes down to protection, providing, and procreation. 
[P100]  Iадib Axel- He's about gendering a workplace in the context of trying to excuse a total elimination of what I would think is probably healthy moderation. I imagine Daniel and Constantine might have a different view.

主题：父亲对子女的未来建议

输入内容：
[P138]  A hallmark of a free society and a democracy is that pretty much anyone can say pretty much anything about pretty much anybody. I believe that. The question is, do machines and bots have free speech rights? Because if I say something, I believe, and I may be paranoid, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong. I believe VCs whose portfolio companies I've said have overvalued have enlisted thousands of bots to basically just shitpost me over and over on X to diminish my credibility. 
[P139]  critical of Putin that the GRU has hired troll farms to create lists of thousands of people to weaponize bots to say disparaging things about them. Do those bots have free speech rights? In addition, when Fox News distributes information to its anchors saying Dominion voting machines were weaponized by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, despite the fact they knew that was not true, but they tell their broadcasters to do it anyways. And then Dominion says, this hurt our business. 
[P140]  and you knew it was false, and you decided to communicate it anyways, courts find them liable. They have to pay three quarters of a billion dollars. What happened at Fox News was a dumpster fire compared to the nuclear mushroom cloud on Meta. So a lot of what we're talking about here, if you want to say that mRNA vaccines alter your DNA, I think you should have the right to say that. The dissenter's voice is important because occasionally the conspiracy theorist ends up being correct. 
[P141]  is, when you have a business model that elevates the most incendiary, ugly content beyond its organic reach, should you then be exonerated from all liability and slander that traditional media companies are liable to? If we were to say that Elon Musk is a pedophile and start stating facts and evidence of it, and he could show that it's hurt his ability to raise money for Tesla, and he filed legal action against this podcast, 
[P142]  I think we would be in a world of hurt, and that legal liability is warranted. But the most powerful media companies in the world have Section 230 protection, so they have a business model where conspiracy theory or novel content, which is Latin for bullshit and lies, and the more angry it is, it gets elevated beyond its organic reach. So while I'm kind of down with the notion that we should have free speech and anybody should be able to say pretty much whatever they want, 
[P143]  There's something wrong when we have algorithms that have a profit incentive around rage, conspiracy theory, and lies, and two-thirds of Republicans believe that the election was stolen, when one in five Americans think that 9-11 was an inside job. Let's be honest. They thought that before the internet. I remember watching all the 9-11 truth of movies and all of that. But your point overall is right. I totally agree. 
[P144]  Wait, Elon agrees with you. When he bought X, he talked about the bot problem. He talked about the amplification of outrage. He hasn't done as much as I hoped he would have done so far, but I hope that they do address that because that isn't an Elon or an X problem. It's a technology problem of the modern world. The reality is that the more we live our lives online, the more you're going to have the problem of the ability of foreign governments, of individual people to create fake accounts, 
[P145]  bot farms, et cetera, to influence the way we look at all of these things. And we are going to have to come to terms with that reality because it's a technological issue that we're going to have to solve for and we haven't yet. It's also very easy for people to get caught in their own bubbles as well, which is a new phenomenon. There was a time where if you believed crazy things, you still had to sit next to someone else in church and talk to them about their life and what they believe. And you encountered dissenting voices. 
[P146]  encountered sane, rational people who had very different views to you that you had to be friends with long term. Whereas where we are right now is if you've got some sort of crazy view, you can find yourself only talking to people who share those views and only sharing content that reinforces those views until such time that you become extremely radicalized. I think that's such an important point because I think it's a real shame that AI LLMs aren't crawling the real world. I was at Granger's yesterday. Someone comes up to me. 
[P147]  Love your content. Let's take a picture. They're so nice. Another person comes up to me and says, I disagree with your view on this, but we have a civil conversation. And then I come home to 40 bots telling me I'm Professor Genocide. I mean, people in the real world, generally speaking, I don't know if it's because of the threat of physical violence, or they want to have sex with you, or maybe they think at some point you'll hire their kid, or generally just a comity of man. But people in real life, I find, are just lovely and wonderful. And it's a shame that these LLMs aren't calling this. 
[P148]  because the treif and some of the vile shit they're crawling online, which I don't even think reflects our species. I think it reflects technology that has a profit motive around promoting the most incendiary, hateful content. So there's got to be some sort of medium speed here. And also, I got off X, Steve, because you don't like Chick-fil-A, don't eat a Chick-fil-A. If Musk wants to pay $44 billion and turn it into a Nazi porn bar, that's his right. 
[P149]  illegal. I don't think the government should step in. But I don't have to paint his fence. And I can go to another platform. That's my right, too. And everyone says, oh, you're against free speech. I'm like, no, I'm not. I'm against being on a platform that makes me feel bad. So he has the right. And all this notion around meta, free speech, it's a little different because they control so much of the media. But these are media companies, and they should be liable for slander or defamation, the same way traditional media companies are in

主题：Scuttlebutt方法在投资决策中的应用

输入内容：
[P28]  first question about who the customer is, is very, very essential. After all, it's the customers who are going to be sending checks to the company, which eventually shows up in the top line as revenue. So Abner breaks down customers into three primary categories. So the first are the end users. Let's imagine that we're looking at a software company. This would be people who use the actual software, maybe as part of their daily life or as part of their job. So these are the people who might actually use the software, 
[P29]  not actually be in charge of actually buying the software. But they might, you know, obviously like the product so much that they're going to recommend that they use a specific product to the people who actually do send the checks. So these types of people, you know, if they're using a software that they can't live without, that's obviously very, very important because it means that the people who are sending checks probably also know that. And it means that the checks are going to keep on coming in. That is a good segue here to the second customer, which are the decision makers. These are the people that might not actually physically write and send the checks, 
[P30]  but they can approve if a specific product is purchased. So these two people sometimes are the same person, sometimes aren't the same person. And then the third and final type of customer are just the people that sign and send the checks. Again, they might not actually be the end user. A very, very important distinction. So the perfect customer is when the same person does all three of these functions, but that's just not always the case. I sleuthed this exact question on a business that sells software to petroleum engineers, 
[P31]  someone who was a customer of the business and used the product. So if I look at it in the framework used above, the person I spoke to fulfilled probably the first and second functions of the customers. So they got to be the end user and they got to tell someone to basically send the check so that they could continue using it. But they didn't actually send the check themselves. Now, from what I learned about chatting with this person, it was pretty easy for them to get the software if they needed it. Luckily, the software is in kind of a duopoly. So the options are very limited. 
[P32]  got A or B. Now, the reason it's so important to understand these three customer categories is because there can be a specific relationship where a business isn't necessarily selling its product to the right person. So Abner has a really, really good example in his book where he discussed this fictitious company called Alpaca Systems. So this business sold customer relation management CRM software to retail stock brokers. So let's use just Abner's framework in this case study. So who are the customers? So the customers were the retail broker's manager, 
[P33]  and the retail brokers. Second question, what exactly is each customer buying? The manager was actually buying control of the brokers and the brokers were getting help with improving their productivity. But as a result of using this software, they're actually losing control over their own clients. So the third question here is what exactly is Alpaca selling? So Admir initially thought that it was productivity tools, which it really was, but it was also control over the brokers. And Alpaca, the business, 
[P34]  didn't actually realize this at the time. So the fourth question is, why would the customer buy it? And so if you look at the broker's managers, they bought it because the software worked. And if the broker's produced at a high level, they got higher bonuses. Additionally, it gave the firm even more control over the broker's clients because they knew more about every one of their clients. But there was a problem here. And that was that if a broker wanted to switch firms, they often needed control of their own clients. If they wanted to switch firms and weren't going to bring any clients over,

主题：投资大师的商业理解与Scuttlebutt方法

输入内容：
[P1] ﻿ You're listening to TIP. One key to some of the legendary investors' most significant investments was their deep understanding of a business. Whether you look at people like Warren Buffett, Leeloo, or Philip Fisher, these guys just knew how to understand a business better than nearly anybody else out there. They used this knowledge to their advantage, finding investments that were unloved or orphaned unnecessarily. Today, I will cover a wide range of people that you can talk to to understand a business 
[P2]  at an extremely high level. From my research into scuttlebutt, I found four primary parties that you want to talk to to improve your understanding of a business. I'll cover precisely who those parties are and what you should ask them to enhance your own business acumen. Now, you might be wondering, why should I add the scuttlebutt method when researching a stock? After all, isn't reading public information enough to understand the business? And to answer that, I would say, yeah, you probably can learn a lot about a company via public filings, 
[P3]  research reports, earnings calls, and earnings reports. But you will never understand a business to its full extent using these resources exclusively. If you want an edge in investing, you have to work for it. And Scuttlebutt is that edge that I think very few are willing to do, but the ones that are willing to do it can get these very, very outsized returns. This episode has some great case studies to really hammer home how important Scuttlebutt is. You'll learn how legends like Warren Buffett and Lee Liu have used Scuttlebutt to find incredible investments.

So after that, she looked at their annual report and found the names and pictures of the executives, which she then used to verify their identity. It was indeed the company. Abner refers to it here as Filmex. It was similar to the ad agency case study I spoke about where cost cutting wasn't in the cards. So given the behavior of the bankers and the executives, it was quite clear to Michelle that the executives had just gotten a win in terms of their financial health. 
[P85]  buying shares and made about $90,000 over two days after the news of the restructuring had been announced to the public. Now here's an excellent summary of the experience. Michelle was not an employee of the bank of industry nor an employee of Filmex, not of their lawyers or accountants or anyone else defined by law as the company's insider. She had not bribed anyone nor stolen any information. She had merely observed some physical events that took place off of Filmex's premises in a public hallway. Yet she could say with an extremely high certainty that the business 
[P86]  industry was about to cut Filmex's debt and that Filmex's stock would in all likelihood soar as a result. Now, as the story of what illustrates, a business's supplier doesn't have to be the supplier in the traditional sense. It could be bankers as well. It's up to you to kind of think outside the box and use your opportunity set and skillset to find ways of observing things that are happening around you and things that you can use to your own advantage.

主题：Scuttlebutt方法中的客户分析

输入内容：
[P49]  is they're going to give you unique insights that current customers might not provide because they probably don't have a filter and maybe they're not in love with that product compared to current customers. So they can give you different perspectives. So from potential customers, you can just learn things like why they're doing business with the business competitor. That alone is a really, really good question to ask because chances are they might've actually tried the product of the business that you're looking at and they're going to be able to compare that to different competitors' products 
[P50]  why they think one product is better than another. And sometimes you might find that the business that you're looking at has an inferior product. And that's a very, very important thing to know. Essentially, what you're trying to do is find out why they aren't a customer. And that alone can really, really help you illuminate any of the business's weaknesses that it might have. So former customers can tell you a lot of things. They can tell you why they stopped paying the business in question. They can tell you what's better or worse with the new business that they're working with. 
[P51]  costs that were involved from using one product to switching to another product. And the thing that's really good about former customers is just the amount of honesty that you're probably going to get. They're probably going to think maybe about that business and not so bright of a light, which could obviously bias them in other directions. But I think it's just a good way to get a variety of different perspectives and really, really get to the truth of why a company's products are better or worse than its competitors, or maybe they're all the same. You never know. 
[P52]  I think that this information is really useful because it can really help you identify potential red flags that you might not be able to identify in any other way. Now let's move on to what you can learn from a business as employees. This includes people from factory workers all the way up to the CEO. These are going to be people like low-level employees, people involved in marketing the business or selling products to customers, executives of a variety of different executives, research and development, board of directors, current employees, former employees, and even competitors. 
[P53]  employees. One of the cool things you can do when you're first starting this is just make a list, try to find current and former employees. Former employees is a little bit harder to figure out. I personally haven't really figured that out yet, but for current employees, you want things like names, find out their connections to people inside of the business or outside of the business, and just get as much detail as you can on people. For lower level employees, it can be a little bit harder to find them as they're not necessarily featured on a business's website. If you look at the proxy statement or 
[P54]  a circular of a business, they're going to tell you quite clearly who are management, who are the board directors. So those names are easy to come across. But if you are looking for lower level employees, sometimes if you go to a company's website, you can see if they have an about me section. And sometimes the about me section will actually talk about lower level employees, maybe have some quotes. And these quotes are usually, I don't even know if these quotes are actually from the employees, but sometimes they share their name. So an easy way to find out these employees is put their name into 
[P55]  or put their name into LinkedIn. And that's the way that I personally have found a ton of employees. And then even if you can't find the names of employees, LinkedIn is still super helpful. So if you use the search function on LinkedIn, there's actually quite a bit of information you can find. So you can go on LinkedIn, use the search function, look at the name of the company that you're looking for. Then you go to the people tab and basically all the company's employees who are on LinkedIn who list that business as their employer will be on there. Then you can try to reach out to them on LinkedIn.

输入内容：
[P4]  also review some other case studies from others that have successfully sleuthed a business and reaped some enormous benefits. And then to finish the episode off and stay with the ethos of improved learning, I wanted to weave in how you can use your circle of competence to better understand industries or business templates to either double down on or to avoid like the plague. Self-reflection and deep thinking are key to Warren Buffett's success, and I thought I'd share my framework as well for learning from my prior mistakes. If you're the type of person who enjoys introspective 
[P5]  resonate with my framework. Now, without further ado, let's get right into this week's episode. Welcome to The Investor's Podcast. I'm your host, Kyle Grieve. 
[P6]  which is Scuttlebutt, which was made famous by Philip Fisher in his wonderful book, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits. But I'm not going to go over just that book, which I did pretty recently. I'm actually going to focus on the theme of Scuttlebutt and look at a variety of really, really good resources that are going to help you become more proficient at deepening your own understanding of a business. Now, one of the most important parts of investing is gaining the conviction that the investing decisions that you make are correct. 
[P7]  conviction. Maybe you are looking at the numbers and seeing that the business is growing at a pace that you're happy with. Or perhaps the company launched a new product and you think they've executed flawlessly on that product launch. Or maybe you're tracking the returns on invested capital, or maybe their margin expansion, and you're observing that they're continuing to move in a desirable direction. Now, while there's nothing wrong with using these methods to improve your conviction, today we're going to look at an analytical method to really help improve your understanding of a business. And here's the thing, everyone has access. 
[P8]  to the information that I discussed above, right? I can log on to FinChat or Seeking Alpha and get these numbers pretty simply. But the problem is, in order to be successful with investing, you need a variant perception in order to take advantage of the markets. And learning info that is not contained in the financial statements of a business is one of the best ways, I think, that you can accomplish this. So today, we're going to be discussing, like I already mentioned, Scuttlebutt. Now, many listeners of TIP will be familiar with Scuttlebutt. It's a concept I spoke about on TIP 646. 
[P9]  For those who don't know what Scuttlebutt is, it's simply the process of learning about a business by accumulating information about that business by talking with people that are associated with the company. Now, people who are associated with the company could be a variety of people. It could be the CEO. It could be lower level employees. It could be the sales department. It could be people in research and development. It could also be customers, suppliers, and industry experts, et cetera. But let's circle back here to why Scuttlebutt is so essential. Let's say I know a retail business pretty well.

主题：Scuttlebutt方法的历史与定义

输入内容：
[P22]  added a fifth party, which he likes to look at, which is plant and periphery. Now, he made a really good case as to why this is important. And I think it is important, but we're not going to be covering that today because I want to focus more on the relationship aspect of talking with actual people. And while observing physical things is great and definitely helpful, it just isn't going to be something that I'm going to cover today because I think it would probably take too much time. So each of these four parties can be further broken down by quite a bit, and that's what we're going to spend some more time here doing right now. 
[P23]  Customers. So customers are people like end users. These are people who determine if the product should be purchased or if it should pass on for a competing product. These are the people who send the checks to the company to actually buy the product. You can look at current customers. You can look at former customers. You can look at potential customers. The next section here is employees. So employees is a place where I think a lot of people probably spend a lot of their time, although I think customers might actually be the most important. 
[P24]  But what makes up employees? So you got people like lower level employees, people working machinery, if that's what the kind of business utilizes. You got people in sales and marketing department. You got C-suites, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officers. You got people in research and development, people on the boards of directors. And then you can also look at current employees, former employees, and then also the employees of competitors of that business or in a specific industry. 
[P25]  there's kind of three main groups. You're looking at current suppliers, former suppliers, and potential suppliers. And then when you're looking at specialists, there's a whole bunch of different people you'd look at. Competitors, shareholders, other analysts, whether they're professional retail analysts, industry insiders, people who are doing the local news, and maybe even chambers of commerce. Now, let's start here with the most important people to speak to, which is customers. So I already mentioned here that I'm going to be using scuttlebutt and the word sleuthing 
[P26]  interchangeably. So sleuthing was very well covered by Abner Manelman in his book, The Sleuth Investor. So Abner writes, in investment sleuthing, you use detection and investigatory techniques to get exclusive physical information about companies in which you are considering investing. Little known facts about a company can give you a decisive edge when buying or selling that company's stock. So I just wanted to give you that definition. He talks a little bit about scuttlebutt and he, I believe, considers them to be pretty much the same thing as well. Although I will admit that in Abner's 
[P27]  book, he goes much more in-depth into sleuthing. So Abner says, and I agree, that you can learn just an inordinate amount about a business from understanding its customers at a very deep level. So he poses just four kind of questions to better understand a business by talking to its customers. So the first one is, who are the customers? The second one is, what exactly is being purchased? The third is, what is actually being sold? And the fourth is, why would the customer buy from the business in question versus a competitor? So let's break these down in a little more detail.

输入内容：
[P70]  to the company? Are they actually doing something to provide value to that board? Or are they just there to pump up the CEO and agree with everything that he says? You may want to find out how they came about that board seat. Was it because they went to college with the CEO or someone else on the board or maybe another executive? Or was it because they've been in the industry for 30 years and they've done incredibly well with other businesses? You should look at the track record of board members. Do they have a long track record of success or 
[P71]  failure with some of the other businesses that maybe they've either managed or been a board member of. And then another one here that I think is really important is what are they doing for income? Is this board seat their primary source of income? Because if they're only getting income from being on boards of a few companies, that's very important because that means that they're probably not going to go out of their way to make things difficult if they see that things aren't being managed properly. 
[P72]  is not the CEO. But if you have someone who really needs to keep their board seat, chances are they're more likely to be leaning towards agreeing with the CEO to not make their job get into any jeopardy. So another great lesson that I've learned from talking with employees was one of Buffett's most famous investments, which was Geico. So Buffett learned about Geico when he was still a student of Benjamin Graham's at Columbia University. So he was in the library one day and he realized that Benjamin Graham, 
[P73]  was the chairman of GEICO. So I think this was just like a week later, he ended up making the trek to Washington on a weekend. And he got to the GEICO HQ, but was disappointed to learn that the doors were locked, that the location was closed for business. Luckily, there was a janitor who was working in there and let Buffett in. And so the janitor brought Warren to Lorimer Davidson, and who was the only person who was working in that day. And he actually spent four hours answering just endless questions from a young and curious Warren Buffett about 
[P74]  Geico, and just the insurance business in general. Warren said this one event changed his life. Now, this story has many interesting implications. It shows that you need the drive to go and do things that 99.99% of investors just won't do, like travel on a weekend to a company's headquarters. You need to be curious about the business and come prepared with questions to show people that you really understand them to some degree. And you also need a bit of luck. If the janitor was on a break or didn't want to be bothered, he may never have let 
[P75]  passed on that business if he didn't have the drive to go and give the headquarters another visit. Now let's transition here and discuss another critical area of a business's operations, which is its suppliers. This is an area that Philip Fisher didn't spend too much time on in common stocks and on common profits. So we're going to look at two other books, The Sleuth Investor and Scuttlebutt Investor for some ideas on why and how we should look at suppliers to kind of better understand that relationship between a company and its suppliers. 
[P76]  where Monish Pabrai was discussing win-win business relationships. Part of the reason for Charlie's love affair with Costco was that the business was in this win-win relationship. Suppliers won, just like shareholders and customers. This is a pretty rare relationship to find. That's not to say that you must have these types of relationships to find successful investments, but it doesn't hurt to find out more about the relationship that a company has with its suppliers. So here's what Monish said about win-lose relationships between a business and its suppliers.

[P35]  valuable to the new firm. And unfortunately, the Alpaca system didn't allow this. So even if the brokers were using the Alpaca system, they actually weren't using it to its full capabilities. They were doing things like keeping paper records and keeping copies of their customer's info at home. That way, that gave them more control over their clients if they wanted to eventually leave their former company. So Abner wrote, while Alpaca thought it was only selling higher productivity to its product users, it was also unknowingly helping its users' employers enslave them. 
[P36]  one of the best examples I can give of a strategic mistake. And it is one I would likely never have grasped if I had not talked to the final product users directly. Certainly, no brokerage analyst would dare to write up the above in a research report. Now, once Abner learned about this part of the business, he kind of stopped sleuthing it at a deep level and he loosely followed it. But fast forward a little bit and he actually observed that Alpaca eventually did something quite brilliant. They actually fired their customers who are the broker's managers. And instead of selling to the broker's managers, 
[P37]  sold directly to the brokers themselves. So they geared the software to the specific brokers and they targeted just the highest earners. This allowed the brokers to improve productivity by using the software while allowing them to keep control over their own clients. So if they wanted to leave, the software would still work with them even if they left to go to a different firm. Now, this is the type of information that is readily available to anyone who's willing to go and look for it, but very few people do this kind of work. 
[P38]  in a business's financial document and use things like Google or ChatGPT to get questions answered. Now, while this is better than doing nothing, it won't give you the type of informational advantage because anybody with a computer and an internet connection can have the same access as you. Let's look at another just classic example of scuttlebutt that Warren Buffett did a few decades ago. This concerned a business most listeners are going to be familiar with, American Express. Warren had owned American Express stock more than once, 
[P39]  time. So it's part of his business analysis. So we're going to go over the first time here. And this was during the salad oil scandal. So my colleague, Clay, actually just went over that in some detail on TIP682, which I'll get linked up here. So I won't go into too much depth into it. But I will say that essentially what happened was that the market assumed the salad oil scandal would be really bad for the business of American Express. But Warren, he could have just read what was written in the paper, read what all other investors were reading, and concluded the same thing. 
[P40]  Outside of it, he did his own scuttlebutt and realized that the scandal that was going on didn't actually affect American Express's business. So let's go over that in some more detail. Since he could tell their financial health was okay from reading public documents, he then tasked himself with finding out about the customers of American Express and if they were behaving any differently than from before the scandal had happened. He had a very simple way of doing this. He just simply went to places that accepted American Express and he hung around the cash register. 
[P41]  were still using the American Express card, and he asked if the customer behavior had changed at all. Once he deemed that their behavior had not changed, he knew that American Express was an opportunity that was lying in the open for him to take advantage of, which he did to quite a high degree of success. Now, I'll reiterate here that scuttlebutt he did could not be gleaned from public information. If something like this happened today, it wouldn't be that hard to reach out to a family member or friends or colleagues that had an American Express card and ask them if they're still using one. I know I own one personally. If something like this happened today,

主题：Scuttlebutt方法的具体实施步骤

输入内容：
[P10]  Let's call it ABC. Let's say I think the business is starting to get expensive. I have three pretty simple options. I can sell it, I can hold it, and I can buy more. Now, most investors will base which of these decisions they're going to make based on things like intrinsic value of the business, the evaluation of the company, its growth rates, understanding and evaluating management based on earnings calls. And that's all fine and dandy, but in the example above, I'm still making some sort of error. If I knew people intimately involved in the business and could ask them questions like, 
[P11]  at ABC during the holiday season, I might get information that is much more valuable than looking at just the information that I gave in the example here. Now, let's say I ask a lower level employee that same question, and the response is something along the lines of, work was swamped, items were flying off the shelves, and we couldn't replace them fast enough. Oh, also, we were also shown a video by management that thanked the employees for record sales in North America and e-commerce. Now, once you hear this news, you probably won't be in such a rush to sell 
[P12]  shares as it means the business is continuing to improve. This is a real case study for me. And after hearing it, I knew I'd hold my shares longer and I still do. But this is news I wouldn't have ever been able to use in my analysis if I didn't know the people in the industry or know the people who are familiar with that business. I know people like Philip Fisher would agree that Scuttlebutt is integral to the success of many great investors. So today we're going to cover legendary investors and their Scuttlebutt strategies. We're going to look at things like how Warren got a masterclass in insurance, 
[P13]  We'll look at how Lee Liu befriended a board member of Timberland to help him better understand the integrity and talent of the management team there. And I'm going to sprinkle in plenty of my own stories of scuttlebutt that I think will resonate very, very well with you. But first, a fair warning. Consider a few things first if you want to do scuttlebutt or sleuthing, which I'm going to be using interchangeably here. So first of all, it takes a lot of time. Now, I can go through a company's financial statements or official documents. It's still going to take a lot of time, right? 
[P14]  once you start understanding all the different layers of scuttlebutt that you can do, you can spend a lot of time on just one simple business. And if you want to talk to all the different parties that I'm going to be talking with today, I mean, you could easily make that into a full-time job, which some people do. So just understand that while I think this is the best way to understand a business at a very, very deep level, you're only going to be able to do so much of it. You're not going to be able to do all of it and that's okay. But I think adding little bits and pieces of what I'm going to be covering today is going to be really, really helpful. 
[P15]  So second point here is that it works really well with a concentrated portfolio. As I just alluded to here, if one business can take 40, 80, 100 hours to sleuth or to understand better, that's going to be a business that probably you want to put a lot of money behind. And it's not going to be something where you're going to want to just put 1% in. And on top of that, if you just put doing 1% positions, that means that you probably have a lot of position that if you want to do really, really deep research on a lot of positions, it's nearly impossible. 
[P16]  to do by yourself. And maybe you would need a team of other people to help you out with that. And then the last thing here is that it just requires doing a lot of work that very, very few others will do. And that's why it's so valuable. So if you're the type of person who likes going that extra mile and wants to get that just small little edge, I think this is going to be an area of your analysis that you should spend some time on improving on. And then finally here, I just want to get this out of the way. I'm not describing anything illegal like insider training. That's not what scuttlebutter sleuthing is.

[P77]  which you could call win-lose. For example, there's a company that stretches out the payments they have to make to their suppliers. Maybe they take 60 or 90 days to pay their suppliers and they use the float to improve their financials. Well, that works well for the company, but not so well for the suppliers. So that's kind of an example of a win-lose business. Now, businesses can still succeed with these win-lose relationships. But like I said before, it's important to understand this relationship in a little more detail. 
[P78]  to improve your decision-making. In The Sleuth Investor, Abner points out that you can go to the supply chain to understand the volumes and the prices of what's being supplied and what kind of volume a supplier is offering a business. Another strategy Abner likes is getting to understand potential suppliers. If a company could be boosted by having close relationships with better suppliers, they could see a significant boost in their value. Abner has a bunch of strategies that take a lot of work, but can be highly valuable to anyone who wants to put the effort in. Now, one great story from Abner's book was about 
[P79]  a sleuth he met, who he called Michelle. Michelle had a PhD in mathematical finance, and she was hired by a Canadian subsidiary of this US bank that had started an index fund. She told Admir that she'd made about $90,000 in the market in a very, very quick period of time using some of the interesting sleuthing techniques that she was lucky to be exposed to. Let's get into some of the details of how Michelle sleuthed and made this windfall. So across from Michelle's desk was the office of an investment bank, which Admir refers to as the bank of industry. Now, there are only two primary outcomes that would happen. 
[P80]  Either the debt would be restructured, which was very good for the company and the stock price, or the bankers would force the company to pay, which tended to be unfavorable for the business and its stock price. So it's easy to understand why. If a business has its interest payments cut, that means its pre-tax income goes up and earnings will probably show a bump. If a company must pay increased interest expense, pre-tax income decreases and earnings will suffer. So Michelle had observed that there was an ad agency that she watched where the business borrowed about $10 million from this bank. 
[P81]  And unfortunately, what happened was the company lost a key customer. Now, the bank of industry, in order to recoup its debt, wanted the business to slash costs, basically fire people in order to raise money to service the debt. But the businesses, executives, and key personnel threatened to quit en masse if the business started doing this. Now, this was a horrible proposition to the bank because for this business, employees and executives were not easily replaceable. 
[P82]  likely be next to useless. So the bank relented, and once the debt was restructured, the share price increased by 50% in a very, very short period of time. Now, knowing this case study, Michelle dreamt of being a fly on the wall in one of these meetings. Now, obviously, there was no way for her to arrange this and taking advantage of it would be illegal anyway, but there were other ways for her to sleuth legally, which she ended up doing. So she was just a keen observer of people, and most of the time, the bankers were very cool, calm, and collected, while the business executives who were coming in to talk 
[P83]  their bankers were more nervous when they were walking in, while the business's executives were nervous walking in. But on one occasion, she observed the complete opposite. The executives looked calm entering the office while the bankers actually looked nervous. After the meeting had ended, she observed the nature of the bankers and the executives. And once again, the bankers looked ejected while the executives were high-fiving each other as they left the building. Now, during this process, she really wanted to know who this company was. And so she just looked at them and tried to find a logo or something

输入内容：
[P63]  lot of emphasis on was research and development. He knew that a business that had the potential to be worth multiples of what it was today needed an R&D department that could continue to push the company to create new, innovative, and excellent products that also had the right salespeople in place to go out and actually sell that product to the market. So I think you can kind of lump these two areas together to some degree. So there's this trust manufacturer that I own, and it's in the beginning stages of utilizing automation to increase its output by nearly doubling it in a very short period of time, 
[P64]  the automation equipment's completely installed. I've had the chance to speak with management multiple times and done my best to learn more about who supplies their technology and how it's going to work once it's fully installed and operational. Now, one of the main problems this business will eventually face is that they will be able to double their capacity. Now, on the face of things, this is obviously great. A company that can double capacity with minimal incremental expenses is a very good thing. Still, there's another potential area that must be addressed for this whole process to be successful, and that is that they have to have the sales 
[P65]  people to go out and sell that additional capacity to the market. So I got a chance to reach out to a salesperson in that business. And so I asked them a few things to understand things like how the process is going with sales. I want to know, are they busy? Get a read of how things are going so that I can hopefully be directionally correct. Are they happy with the process? Are they unhappy, lukewarm? I want to know things like, are they adding you salespeople to the team? If they're adding, that's generally a good sign that hopefully there's additional demand 
[P66]  for their product or that they're able to find additional customers to try and send people out to sell to. Another question would be, how is the automation equipment going to impact their customers? Are their customers going to get cost savings, improve service, and things like that? So if you have the ability to chat with current employees, a few things that you should try to learn, gauge their temperature on the company, find out if they're overworked or underworked, find out how promotions are handed out. Are they happy with them? Are they unhappy with them? Find out how they're incentivized. 
[P67]  and which KPIs they're incentivized on. Find out what they think of management. Find out if employees are being brought into the business, who are they being brought in from? Is your company sealing employees from maybe competitors? Is it a specific competitor? And then on the other hand, if employees are exiting, you should try and find out where they're getting their job. Are they going to a specific competitor? These are all interesting points to improve your decision-making. So in the sleuth investor, Admir says one of his favorite tools for learning information 
[P68]  just having beers with employees. Now, this is a method that I haven't had the time to try out yet, but I can see how valuable it would be. If you can speak with employees when they're in more of a casual setting, you're likely to get better information than if you maybe just go to the IR office of a business that's in your local neighborhood and they're just showing you around the workplace. In that scenario, you might just get people that are going to be on their best behavior, even if maybe they don't necessarily 
[P69]  and make the optics look good. But in an informal setting, you may get people to open up more. But like I said, I do realize this is a lot of work, which is why I still haven't gotten around to trying it myself. A few other people who are worth chatting with are members of the board of directors. Although they have to be very, very cautious about what they say, this is probably good. You don't want them getting in trouble, giving insider information, but they can still be pretty good sources of information. A few things that you can learn from them would be,

[P56]  Now, I'll be honest with you, from my experience, this is more of a volume game. I think with LinkedIn, a lot of people use LinkedIn for jobs. So if they already have a job, they're not necessarily going to be on there probably very often. Some people are, some people aren't. And so, like I said, volume game, you got to just try to connect with people, shoot them a DM. And there's probably a good chance a lot of people won't answer you. And that's okay. That's just kind of part of the scuttlebutt process. But there are enough people that will answer you that I think it's worth it. So Philip Fisher had some great strategies. 
[P57]  for Scuttlebutt when it came specifically to this segment here about employees. So when Philip sought answers to questions about what you should look for in investment with a lot of potential, he wrote, 
[P58]  functions form a worthwhile conclusion as to whether the particular company has outstanding potentialities for growth and development. Now, the problem is that getting information from key personnel can be quite difficult because oftentimes these people are very, very successful. And part of that success means that they're probably working a lot. And they also work for very, very successful companies, which have very high expectations. So a lot of times they're not necessarily going to be too eager to just talk to some stranger about their job. 
[P59]  Some of these people, for instance, in research and development, they're probably not going to be too interested in sharing the stuff that they're working on if there's people from competitors that are listening in or whatever, or maybe some of them even have non-disclosure agreements where they can't talk about it. But nonetheless, Phil liked to look at people in things like the research and development departments as well as salespeople. He wanted to know specifically to do with salespeople if the business had the right people inside of it to continue growing. 
[P60]  the heads of departments, but also just from lower level people in sales as well. So things that I like to find out from salespeople are, you know, just ask them how things are going. Are they enjoying their job? Are they disliking their job? Are they busy? You know, do they have a lot of time on their hands or are they swamped? Obviously, you know, that can help you understand more. If someone goes from being not so busy to super busy, well, maybe there's something interesting going on in that business. You might find out how they're incentivized. Incentivization systems are easy to find on public documentations for management, 
[P61]  not necessarily for employees. So I'm not going to tell you to go and ask how much money someone makes, but if you just ask them how they're incentivized, is it based off of a commission or whatever, that's important information. And if you develop some sort of relationship, I think you can probably get that kind of information. Other things that are really interesting to get is their thoughts on management. Do they like management or do they dislike management? I think that's pretty interesting to know. And if everyone dislikes management, well, that's probably a pretty big red flag. 
[P62]  business. If you talk to a bunch of people and they're all seemingly pretty down on the business, well, that's an interesting sign. And also on the other side, if everyone's very, very happy about the business and giddy and excited, well, that's another really, really good sign as well. And then if you're talking to people about their job and you find out that maybe a bunch of their colleagues got fired and aren't being replaced by new people, I mean, that alone is a really good signal that maybe the business is very unlikely to increase its sales anytime soon.

主题：Scuttlebutt方法的挑战与局限性

输入内容：
[P17]  So there was a really good book that I read in prepping for this episode called Scuttlebutt Investor. And so here's what the definition of scuttlebutt was. The origin of the term is related to sailing. Water for consumption on sailing ships was typically stored in a scuttlebutt, a butt or a cask, which had been scuttled by making a hole in it so the water could be withdrawn. Since sailors exchanged gossip when they gathered at the scuttlebutt for a drink of water, scuttlebutt became slang for gossip or rumors. 
[P18]  equivalent of water cooler talk. Now, another reason that Scuttlebutt is so important is related to a wonderful Charlie Munger quote. He said, I never disagree with someone else's opinion unless I understand their side better than they do. Now, in my opinion, Scuttlebutt will help you determine if a business would make a better short than a long. Now, I personally have never shorted a stock in my life, but I think if a company is likely to go down in price, that's probably a pretty good thing to know if I'm contemplating going long on that idea. Now, suppose you know that a business has, 
[P19]  a 90% customer concentration. And that one customer who made up 90% was just lost. In that case, that's probably really, really good evidence that the company is likely to be worth just a lot less once that news comes out and probably for a long time into the future, maybe forever into the future. Scuttlebutt can help you determine which types of events can build or destroy conviction. So there's a business that I loosely followed. It's a microcap called Avricor Health. This business just crushed it going from about $0.07 
[P20]  to 24 cents in less than a year. Then they announced a strategic shift away from pharmacies in Canada and that they would actually be going towards going international. And now the price has dropped back down to 4 cents. So hypothetically speaking, if someone could chat with the people who were sending checks or who were the actual customers of Avricor from the pharmacies that were leaving, they would have learned that that relationship had been severed or funding had been cut and they probably could have gotten out before this massive rundown and they maybe could 
[P21]  understood that this business was going to lose their customer even earlier than the market actually did. So that's the kind of information that you can get from doing Scuttlebutt. Now let's get into the meat of today's episode and talk about how we do Scuttlebutt. The way I see it, there are kind of four primary parties that we want to talk to, to understand the state of a business. The first one is going to be customers. The second one is going to be employees. Number three would be suppliers. And the fourth is specialists. So in his excellent book, which I'm going to be referring to a lot here today, which is called The Sleuth Investor, the author, Abner Mandelman,

输入内容：
[P27]  book, he goes much more in-depth into sleuthing. So Abner says, and I agree, that you can learn just an inordinate amount about a business from understanding its customers at a very deep level. So he poses just four kind of questions to better understand a business by talking to its customers. So the first one is, who are the customers? The second one is, what exactly is being purchased? The third is, what is actually being sold? And the fourth is, why would the customer buy from the business in question versus a competitor? So let's break these down in a little more detail. 
[P28]  first question about who the customer is, is very, very essential. After all, it's the customers who are going to be sending checks to the company, which eventually shows up in the top line as revenue. So Abner breaks down customers into three primary categories. So the first are the end users. Let's imagine that we're looking at a software company. This would be people who use the actual software, maybe as part of their daily life or as part of their job. So these are the people who might actually use the software, 
[P29]  not actually be in charge of actually buying the software. But they might, you know, obviously like the product so much that they're going to recommend that they use a specific product to the people who actually do send the checks. So these types of people, you know, if they're using a software that they can't live without, that's obviously very, very important because it means that the people who are sending checks probably also know that. And it means that the checks are going to keep on coming in. That is a good segue here to the second customer, which are the decision makers. These are the people that might not actually physically write and send the checks,

[P30]  but they can approve if a specific product is purchased. So these two people sometimes are the same person, sometimes aren't the same person. And then the third and final type of customer are just the people that sign and send the checks. Again, they might not actually be the end user. A very, very important distinction. So the perfect customer is when the same person does all three of these functions, but that's just not always the case. I sleuthed this exact question on a business that sells software to petroleum engineers, 
[P31]  someone who was a customer of the business and used the product. So if I look at it in the framework used above, the person I spoke to fulfilled probably the first and second functions of the customers. So they got to be the end user and they got to tell someone to basically send the check so that they could continue using it. But they didn't actually send the check themselves. Now, from what I learned about chatting with this person, it was pretty easy for them to get the software if they needed it. Luckily, the software is in kind of a duopoly. So the options are very limited. 
[P32]  got A or B. Now, the reason it's so important to understand these three customer categories is because there can be a specific relationship where a business isn't necessarily selling its product to the right person. So Abner has a really, really good example in his book where he discussed this fictitious company called Alpaca Systems. So this business sold customer relation management CRM software to retail stock brokers. So let's use just Abner's framework in this case study. So who are the customers? So the customers were the retail broker's manager,

主题：投资大师的商业理解与Scuttlebutt方法

输入内容：
[P1] ﻿ You're listening to TIP. One key to some of the legendary investors' most significant investments was their deep understanding of a business. Whether you look at people like Warren Buffett, Leeloo, or Philip Fisher, these guys just knew how to understand a business better than nearly anybody else out there. They used this knowledge to their advantage, finding investments that were unloved or orphaned unnecessarily. Today, I will cover a wide range of people that you can talk to to understand a business 
[P2]  at an extremely high level. From my research into scuttlebutt, I found four primary parties that you want to talk to to improve your understanding of a business. I'll cover precisely who those parties are and what you should ask them to enhance your own business acumen. Now, you might be wondering, why should I add the scuttlebutt method when researching a stock? After all, isn't reading public information enough to understand the business? And to answer that, I would say, yeah, you probably can learn a lot about a company via public filings, 
[P3]  research reports, earnings calls, and earnings reports. But you will never understand a business to its full extent using these resources exclusively. If you want an edge in investing, you have to work for it. And Scuttlebutt is that edge that I think very few are willing to do, but the ones that are willing to do it can get these very, very outsized returns. This episode has some great case studies to really hammer home how important Scuttlebutt is. You'll learn how legends like Warren Buffett and Lee Liu have used Scuttlebutt to find incredible investments.

主题：Scuttlebutt方法的定义与历史背景

输入内容：
[P16]  to do by yourself. And maybe you would need a team of other people to help you out with that. And then the last thing here is that it just requires doing a lot of work that very, very few others will do. And that's why it's so valuable. So if you're the type of person who likes going that extra mile and wants to get that just small little edge, I think this is going to be an area of your analysis that you should spend some time on improving on. And then finally here, I just want to get this out of the way. I'm not describing anything illegal like insider training. That's not what scuttlebutter sleuthing is. 
[P17]  So there was a really good book that I read in prepping for this episode called Scuttlebutt Investor. And so here's what the definition of scuttlebutt was. The origin of the term is related to sailing. Water for consumption on sailing ships was typically stored in a scuttlebutt, a butt or a cask, which had been scuttled by making a hole in it so the water could be withdrawn. Since sailors exchanged gossip when they gathered at the scuttlebutt for a drink of water, scuttlebutt became slang for gossip or rumors.

主题：Scuttlebutt方法的局限性与挑战

输入内容：
[P13]  We'll look at how Lee Liu befriended a board member of Timberland to help him better understand the integrity and talent of the management team there. And I'm going to sprinkle in plenty of my own stories of scuttlebutt that I think will resonate very, very well with you. But first, a fair warning. Consider a few things first if you want to do scuttlebutt or sleuthing, which I'm going to be using interchangeably here. So first of all, it takes a lot of time. Now, I can go through a company's financial statements or official documents. It's still going to take a lot of time, right? 
[P14]  once you start understanding all the different layers of scuttlebutt that you can do, you can spend a lot of time on just one simple business. And if you want to talk to all the different parties that I'm going to be talking with today, I mean, you could easily make that into a full-time job, which some people do. So just understand that while I think this is the best way to understand a business at a very, very deep level, you're only going to be able to do so much of it. You're not going to be able to do all of it and that's okay. But I think adding little bits and pieces of what I'm going to be covering today is going to be really, really helpful. 
[P15]  So second point here is that it works really well with a concentrated portfolio. As I just alluded to here, if one business can take 40, 80, 100 hours to sleuth or to understand better, that's going to be a business that probably you want to put a lot of money behind. And it's not going to be something where you're going to want to just put 1% in. And on top of that, if you just put doing 1% positions, that means that you probably have a lot of position that if you want to do really, really deep research on a lot of positions, it's nearly impossible.

[P24]  But what makes up employees? So you got people like lower level employees, people working machinery, if that's what the kind of business utilizes. You got people in sales and marketing department. You got C-suites, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officers. You got people in research and development, people on the boards of directors. And then you can also look at current employees, former employees, and then also the employees of competitors of that business or in a specific industry. 
[P25]  there's kind of three main groups. You're looking at current suppliers, former suppliers, and potential suppliers. And then when you're looking at specialists, there's a whole bunch of different people you'd look at. Competitors, shareholders, other analysts, whether they're professional retail analysts, industry insiders, people who are doing the local news, and maybe even chambers of commerce. Now, let's start here with the most important people to speak to, which is customers. So I already mentioned here that I'm going to be using scuttlebutt and the word sleuthing 
[P26]  interchangeably. So sleuthing was very well covered by Abner Manelman in his book, The Sleuth Investor. So Abner writes, in investment sleuthing, you use detection and investigatory techniques to get exclusive physical information about companies in which you are considering investing. Little known facts about a company can give you a decisive edge when buying or selling that company's stock. So I just wanted to give you that definition. He talks a little bit about scuttlebutt and he, I believe, considers them to be pretty much the same thing as well. Although I will admit that in Abner's

主题：Scuttlebutt方法的具体实施对象与策略

输入内容：
[P21]  understood that this business was going to lose their customer even earlier than the market actually did. So that's the kind of information that you can get from doing Scuttlebutt. Now let's get into the meat of today's episode and talk about how we do Scuttlebutt. The way I see it, there are kind of four primary parties that we want to talk to, to understand the state of a business. The first one is going to be customers. The second one is going to be employees. Number three would be suppliers. And the fourth is specialists. So in his excellent book, which I'm going to be referring to a lot here today, which is called The Sleuth Investor, the author, Abner Mandelman, 
[P22]  added a fifth party, which he likes to look at, which is plant and periphery. Now, he made a really good case as to why this is important. And I think it is important, but we're not going to be covering that today because I want to focus more on the relationship aspect of talking with actual people. And while observing physical things is great and definitely helpful, it just isn't going to be something that I'm going to cover today because I think it would probably take too much time. So each of these four parties can be further broken down by quite a bit, and that's what we're going to spend some more time here doing right now. 
[P23]  Customers. So customers are people like end users. These are people who determine if the product should be purchased or if it should pass on for a competing product. These are the people who send the checks to the company to actually buy the product. You can look at current customers. You can look at former customers. You can look at potential customers. The next section here is employees. So employees is a place where I think a lot of people probably spend a lot of their time, although I think customers might actually be the most important.

[P7]  conviction. Maybe you are looking at the numbers and seeing that the business is growing at a pace that you're happy with. Or perhaps the company launched a new product and you think they've executed flawlessly on that product launch. Or maybe you're tracking the returns on invested capital, or maybe their margin expansion, and you're observing that they're continuing to move in a desirable direction. Now, while there's nothing wrong with using these methods to improve your conviction, today we're going to look at an analytical method to really help improve your understanding of a business. And here's the thing, everyone has access. 
[P8]  to the information that I discussed above, right? I can log on to FinChat or Seeking Alpha and get these numbers pretty simply. But the problem is, in order to be successful with investing, you need a variant perception in order to take advantage of the markets. And learning info that is not contained in the financial statements of a business is one of the best ways, I think, that you can accomplish this. So today, we're going to be discussing, like I already mentioned, Scuttlebutt. Now, many listeners of TIP will be familiar with Scuttlebutt. It's a concept I spoke about on TIP 646. 
[P9]  For those who don't know what Scuttlebutt is, it's simply the process of learning about a business by accumulating information about that business by talking with people that are associated with the company. Now, people who are associated with the company could be a variety of people. It could be the CEO. It could be lower level employees. It could be the sales department. It could be people in research and development. It could also be customers, suppliers, and industry experts, et cetera. But let's circle back here to why Scuttlebutt is so essential. Let's say I know a retail business pretty well.

[P36]  one of the best examples I can give of a strategic mistake. And it is one I would likely never have grasped if I had not talked to the final product users directly. Certainly, no brokerage analyst would dare to write up the above in a research report. Now, once Abner learned about this part of the business, he kind of stopped sleuthing it at a deep level and he loosely followed it. But fast forward a little bit and he actually observed that Alpaca eventually did something quite brilliant. They actually fired their customers who are the broker's managers. And instead of selling to the broker's managers, 
[P37]  sold directly to the brokers themselves. So they geared the software to the specific brokers and they targeted just the highest earners. This allowed the brokers to improve productivity by using the software while allowing them to keep control over their own clients. So if they wanted to leave, the software would still work with them even if they left to go to a different firm. Now, this is the type of information that is readily available to anyone who's willing to go and look for it, but very few people do this kind of work. 
[P38]  in a business's financial document and use things like Google or ChatGPT to get questions answered. Now, while this is better than doing nothing, it won't give you the type of informational advantage because anybody with a computer and an internet connection can have the same access as you. Let's look at another just classic example of scuttlebutt that Warren Buffett did a few decades ago. This concerned a business most listeners are going to be familiar with, American Express. Warren had owned American Express stock more than once, 

分析结果：

输入内容：
[P33]  and the retail brokers. Second question, what exactly is each customer buying? The manager was actually buying control of the brokers and the brokers were getting help with improving their productivity. But as a result of using this software, they're actually losing control over their own clients. So the third question here is what exactly is Alpaca selling? So Admir initially thought that it was productivity tools, which it really was, but it was also control over the brokers. And Alpaca, the business, 
[P34]  didn't actually realize this at the time. So the fourth question is, why would the customer buy it? And so if you look at the broker's managers, they bought it because the software worked. And if the broker's produced at a high level, they got higher bonuses. Additionally, it gave the firm even more control over the broker's clients because they knew more about every one of their clients. But there was a problem here. And that was that if a broker wanted to switch firms, they often needed control of their own clients. If they wanted to switch firms and weren't going to bring any clients over, 
[P35]  valuable to the new firm. And unfortunately, the Alpaca system didn't allow this. So even if the brokers were using the Alpaca system, they actually weren't using it to its full capabilities. They were doing things like keeping paper records and keeping copies of their customer's info at home. That way, that gave them more control over their clients if they wanted to eventually leave their former company. So Abner wrote, while Alpaca thought it was only selling higher productivity to its product users, it was also unknowingly helping its users' employers enslave them. 

分析结果：
### 主题与核心观点
- **主要论述的主题**：Alpaca软件对经纪人和其客户关系的影响。
- **核心观点和立场**：Alpaca软件虽然提高了经纪人的生产力，但也无意中帮助了经纪人的雇主控制经纪人，限制了经纪人对客户的控制权，从而影响了经纪人的职业自由。

### 论据与事实
- **重要的论据**：
  - 经纪人使用Alpaca软件后，失去了对自己客户的控制。
  - 经纪人经理购买软件是因为软件有效，且高生产力的经纪人能获得更高的奖金。
  - 公司通过软件获得了对经纪人客户更多的控制权。
- **关键的事实依据**：
  - 经纪人如果想换公司，通常需要控制自己的客户，但Alpaca系统不允许这一点。
  - 经纪人因此保留纸质记录和客户信息的副本，以便在换公司时保持对客户的控制。
- **数据支撑**：无具体数据，但通过逻辑推理和实际行为（如保留纸质记录）支持论点。

### 关键信息
- **重要的概念**：控制权、生产力、职业自由。
- **关键的时间点**：无具体时间点。
- **重要的数据**：无具体数据。

### 逻辑结构
- **论述的逻辑关系**：
  - Alpaca软件提高了经纪人的生产力。
  - 但软件也使得公司对经纪人客户的控制增加。
  - 经纪人因此失去了对自己客户的控制，影响了他们的职业自由。
- **因果关联**：
  - 使用Alpaca软件 → 提高生产力 → 公司控制增加 → 经纪人失去客户控制权 → 影响职业自由。
- **推理过程**：
  - 通过分析软件的使用效果和经纪人的实际行为，推导出软件对经纪人职业自由的负面影响。

### 相关引用

### 总结
该部分内容主要讨论了Alpaca软件对经纪人和其客户关系的影响。虽然软件提高了经纪人的生产力，但也使得公司对经纪人客户的控制增加，导致经纪人失去了对自己客户的控制权，影响了他们的职业自由。经纪人因此采取了保留纸质记录等措施，以便在换公司时保持对客户的控制。

输入内容：
[P10]  Let's call it ABC. Let's say I think the business is starting to get expensive. I have three pretty simple options. I can sell it, I can hold it, and I can buy more. Now, most investors will base which of these decisions they're going to make based on things like intrinsic value of the business, the evaluation of the company, its growth rates, understanding and evaluating management based on earnings calls. And that's all fine and dandy, but in the example above, I'm still making some sort of error. If I knew people intimately involved in the business and could ask them questions like, 
[P11]  at ABC during the holiday season, I might get information that is much more valuable than looking at just the information that I gave in the example here. Now, let's say I ask a lower level employee that same question, and the response is something along the lines of, work was swamped, items were flying off the shelves, and we couldn't replace them fast enough. Oh, also, we were also shown a video by management that thanked the employees for record sales in North America and e-commerce. Now, once you hear this news, you probably won't be in such a rush to sell 
[P12]  shares as it means the business is continuing to improve. This is a real case study for me. And after hearing it, I knew I'd hold my shares longer and I still do. But this is news I wouldn't have ever been able to use in my analysis if I didn't know the people in the industry or know the people who are familiar with that business. I know people like Philip Fisher would agree that Scuttlebutt is integral to the success of many great investors. So today we're going to cover legendary investors and their Scuttlebutt strategies.

输入内容：
[P18]  equivalent of water cooler talk. Now, another reason that Scuttlebutt is so important is related to a wonderful Charlie Munger quote. He said, I never disagree with someone else's opinion unless I understand their side better than they do. Now, in my opinion, Scuttlebutt will help you determine if a business would make a better short than a long. Now, I personally have never shorted a stock in my life, but I think if a company is likely to go down in price, that's probably a pretty good thing to know if I'm contemplating going long on that idea. Now, suppose you know that a business has, 
[P19]  a 90% customer concentration. And that one customer who made up 90% was just lost. In that case, that's probably really, really good evidence that the company is likely to be worth just a lot less once that news comes out and probably for a long time into the future, maybe forever into the future. Scuttlebutt can help you determine which types of events can build or destroy conviction. So there's a business that I loosely followed. It's a microcap called Avricor Health. This business just crushed it going from about $0.07 
[P20]  to 24 cents in less than a year. Then they announced a strategic shift away from pharmacies in Canada and that they would actually be going towards going international. And now the price has dropped back down to 4 cents. So hypothetically speaking, if someone could chat with the people who were sending checks or who were the actual customers of Avricor from the pharmacies that were leaving, they would have learned that that relationship had been severed or funding had been cut and they probably could have gotten out before this massive rundown and they maybe could

输入内容：
[P22]  you can have the same pair of jeans as somebody else. In fact, you probably do. What sets you apart is how you personalize them. What sets them apart is that it's the pair that is your favorite that you wear three days a week. You know, this idea of really personalizing your items and having less items as well. Because I think prior to recently, it's been all about having a lot of stuff, having a lot of clothes, especially if you're into fashion, having as many options as possible so that you can constantly 
[P23]  be wearing a new outfit. That was sort of trendy, right? For many years to always be wearing a new outfit, to never wear the same outfit twice. I think that that's out. And I think having signature pieces that are super personalized that you wear over and over and over again and you style a multitude of ways, I think that's in. I even thought about it in terms of the Stanley Cup, which is not really a fashionable thing. That's more of like a pop culture obsession. 
[P24]  a Stanley Cup. I have a Stanley Cup. But I even thought about it like this. Like, this is almost a metaphor for what I mean for fashion in like clothing and stuff. It's the idea of like, instead of having every single color of Stanley Cup, instead of having the bright pink one and the blue one and the sparkly white one and the brown one and the orange one and the green one, you just have one that's your favorite color and you put stickers on it. You take your watch 
[P25]  the middle of the day and you attach it to your Stanley cup and you, it's like truly a utilitarian, like fully functional item. And it is your personal favorite item. It becomes a special thing to you. If you only have one and the one that you do have, you use every day or very consistently. And it looks like you, it becomes your iconic Stanley cup. That I think is going to be cool. That's going to be the way that we 
[P26]  consume, I think, in 2025. Instead of having nine pairs of jeans, you have two and they're both really special. And they're known as like, oh, those are Emma's jeans. Like if somebody were to see your signature pair of jeans on a mannequin in a store, they'd be like, wait, those are what? Those are Emma's jeans. You see what I'm saying here? 
[P27]  re-wear over and over and over again. I honestly love this idea and hope that it ends up happening because I think something that a lot of us are missing, especially those of us who love fashion and love to participate in fashion, is a sort of attachment to our belongings, our clothing, our accessories. Nowadays, it's about buying more by whatever means necessary, thrifting, buying online for really cheap,

[P1] ﻿ About a year ago, I predicted the boat shoe trend. Yeah, I did. And can I be honest? Since then, I've been chasing that feeling. The feeling of predicting a trend and then seeing it in the real world, I imagine rivals the feeling of seeing your newborn baby for the first time. Like, I think I'll probably feel that excited again on the day that I give birth to my first child. That's the next time I'll feel that level of satisfaction, unless, 
[P2]  I'm able to successfully predict another trend before that, which is what I'm going to try to do today. Today, I am going to share with you my 2025 fashion trend predictions. If I can get even one of these right, I'll be able to match that feeling I got when I predicted the boat shoe coming back. But I'm being realistic here. I don't have a crystal ball. Some of these predictions are random gut feelings. 
[P3]  are based on what I've studied sort of starting to become popular over the past few years, but haven't fully gone mainstream yet. And I predict that this year they will go mainstream. So it's a combination of gut feelings and educated guesses. The educated guesses are less satisfying if they come true because it's like I saw it coming in the world, right? The gut feelings, those, if they come true, 
[P4]  more rewarding. So hopefully, well, whatever. I'll just be happy if I get anything right. So let's begin. 2025 fashion trend predictions. I briefly paused this episode of Anything Goes to let you know that this episode of Anything Goes is presented by Amazon. Getting sick is horrible enough.

[P10]  simple dress pants or capris, classic just suit jackets, blazers, simple dresses that aren't super tight in neutral colors, lots of black boots, lots of plain, simple, flat loafers, black, white, brown. I mean, yeah, it's just, it's like, it's very, it's simple, but it does still have swag. And the swag element is what's really 
[P11]  really hard to put a finger on. Somehow 90s minimalism, when you Google it, it doesn't look boring. There's magic happening with it somehow. I don't know. I see 90s minimalism really being the main trend this year. And here's the thing. The truth of the matter is minimalism in clothing design is timeless. Like a white button down, a pair of blue jeans, a pair of black slacks, a pair of little simple black loafers, a black boot. 
[P12]  a white t-shirt. These things are never out. They are always in. So a lot of people I've seen online saying like, minimalism is just another trend. It's not preventing people from buying more stuff. People are going to buy minimalist design. And then when that's out, they're going to go and they're going to buy maximalist design again. Minimalist stuff is just as trendy as maximalist stuff. I actually disagree. There's kind of a debate happening on the internet around 
[P13]  whether or not minimalist designs are timeless, whether or not they come in and out of style. I definitely do think they have trendy moments, but I think unlike maximalist designs, they're always in and no one can change my mind. Okay. I think minimalist design is really going to be in, in 2025, but it's never going to be out because it's too simple to ever be in or out. You know what I'm saying? If you were doing sort of the clean girl aesthetic, 
[P14]  2024, 2023, 2024, which consisted of, you know, the slick back bun, the trench coats, the dress pants, the little loafers, the little button up shirts. It's just very like chic and classy. Literally, just by styling that slightly different, maybe doing your hair a little bit different, maybe accessorizing a little bit differently, you now have 90s minimalism, right? And then in a few years when there's a new sort of minimalist style that's in, you can, 
[P15]  reuse those pieces again. I just, I really do think when it comes to trends, any sort of minimalist trend to me is the safest one to buy into because you actually can reuse those pieces in a million different ways. So I think investing in good minimalist pieces, I would be shocked if you regretted it, you know, unless you're just a maximalist at heart and you don't like clothes like that. Fair enough.

I think they're going to be all the rage in a bazillion different ways. Like the black and white stripe, indie sleaze. Blue and white stripe, nautical aesthetic. Okay. Red and white stripe, nautical aesthetic. I think a nautical stripe is going to be really in, which I absolutely love. 
[P105]  classic cable knit sweaters, like thick, chunky, high quality looking, simple, one color, neutral colors, cable knit sweater, like a cream cable knit sweater, a blue cable knit sweater, not neon, not bright, muted, muted colors, muted colors, cable knit sweater, very fisherman looking, very vintage looking, but not vintage in like an eighties way. No, 
[P106]  Oh, classic, classic, simple, neutral cable knit sweater. Thick knit, thick, thick yarn. Not thin, not flimsy, thick, boxy, fisherman cable knit sweater. Little fisherman's hats, okay? Like a little tight little beanie or like a little tight little cap that has no bill at the front. Like it's just a little fisherman's cap, a little, do you know what those are? Like a little cap? Cap? 
[P107]  with no front bill. What is that called? Great. I found it. Yeah. It's a no brim hat, a pillock's hat. Is that what it's called? Pillock's. Watch that be like some sort of like really rude derogatory term. I always get, no, it's not called a pillock's. Oh, is it pillbox or pillock's? This is not what I'm looking for. This is wrong. It's a no brim hat, brimless hat. 
[P108]  those are in. I actually almost bought a brimless hat like six months ago. I didn't end up buying it because the material was a little bit too cheap for my liking, but I've had my eye on those for a while now and I think they're going to be in. And last but not least, in the world of nautical fashion, this is not very fisherman aesthetic. This is not very, it's not even that nautical, like it is nautical, but it's like, it's a bit more elevated 
[P109]  it? Pearls. I think pearls are in. Like a little pearl necklace. I don't know. I feel like pearls haven't been in for a while. And I could see pearls having a moment this year. Like a chic, classic pearl. I don't know. I could see it happening. Okay. That is what I think is going to be in in 2025. If I literally get one of those predictions correct, I will be so stoked. I mean, the truth of the matter is, 
[P110]  lot of those predictions aren't even fully predictions because a lot of them are already starting to pop up now or like they already were popping up last year, but maybe they just weren't mainstream yet. And I think they're going to go mainstream this year. And then some things were more random, but we shall see. Here's what I think is going to go out of style in 2025. These are the things that I predict are really going to go out.

[P55]  I mean, like, let's say you have a little sweater. Instead of the buttons going down the middle, the buttons are going down the left side of the sweater. Or even weird shit, like a shirt where one sleeve is long and one sleeve is short. Or a skirt where, like, the left side of the skirt is long and the right side of the skirt is, like, a foot shorter. Or a seam that goes down a weird part of the shirt. Or, like, do you see what I'm saying? Asymmetrical stuff. 
[P56]  asymmetry is going to be in. I think to take it a step further, minimalist design that is asymmetrical. So like a classic white button down, but the buttons are like on the left side. Do you see what I'm saying? That is going to be so in. Taking like minimalist design and then really just making it asymmetrical. Oh man, people are going to love that. Okay, next. Buttons are the new bows. Yeah, I think that. And I'm frightened. 
[P57]  I'm frightened because I love buttons. To me, buttons are timeless, but I think that they're going to be used as a textural element instead of as a functional element, right? Like buttons are technically used on a garment as sort of a closure mechanism, right? Buttons are used to close the garment, right? I think buttons are going to become trendy to the point where there's buttons everywhere on shit. Buttons don't even need to be there. 
[P58]  a purpose where they are. And can I be honest? I love this. And I think it's timeless. And I think it might become trendy, but I don't even care because I'm going to love that for the rest of my life. I hope it becomes trendy because then I'm going to buy up all the cool stuff. No, I'm not. I'm trying to not have a shopping addiction this year or ever again for the rest of my life. So I will not buy it up. Maybe I'll buy one special button item. But I am 
[P59]  a button tattooed on my arm. So I'm worried that it's going to become trendy to put buttons on everything and then everyone's going to start to hate buttons. And then my tattoo of a button is going to look cringe and basic. Not that there's anything wrong with being basic, but I have a button tattoo on my arm because my favorite movie is Coraline and the button is one of the main symbols of the movie. And so that's why I have a button on my arm. 
[P60]  And that's why I love buttons so much. Also, just because they're freaking cute. They're so cute. Anyway, the reason why I think buttons are the new bows, though, is because similar to a bow, like bows are absolutely timeless. A bow is a bow. It's too crucial of a design element to not be timeless. Like bows will always exist. Bows will always be in. You know what I mean? 
[P61]  will be. But I think the same thing that happened with bows will happen with buttons where we put bows on everything, right? Everybody was tying ribbon around everything. Everybody was, you know, attaching little bows to everything. Brands were coming out with stuff that just had bows all over it. There's just so many bows. It was like, oh my God, we need to stop with the bows. They're not serving a purpose. They're just here and it's stale. It became stale very quickly.

[P97]  Google gardening outfit. Let's see what comes up. Okay. Yeah. Like apron. I could weirdly see aprons like, okay, obviously not like a literal kitchen apron or a literal gardening apron, but like little waist aprons, honestly kind of useful too. Like I would wear that if, if I saw like in a thrift store or something, like a cute little waist belt apron, I would totally buy that and wear that like over jeans, honestly cute. I'm seeing some 
[P98]  overalls. I don't know. I don't know the overalls are going to be in perhaps. I mean, it's part of the gardening aesthetic. Let me look up chef outfit. Yeah. Like I'm looking at chef outfits. It's very often the, the double button sort of jacket, right. Or shirt that could come in. Like, I don't know. I feel like gardening in chef aesthetic is going to be in. I mean, listen, do I think people are going to be wearing like a large 
[P99]  white chef's hat? No, but I don't know. Listen, this is how I feel and it could be totally off base, but I just, I don't know. That's what my gut is telling me. Clogs, aprons, utilitarian gardener, utilitarian chef, you know? Ah, fuck. I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Last but not least, nautical vibes. Okay. The ocean, the sea, fishermen, the whole thing. And this, 
[P100]  This has been rumbling under the surface for a while now. In fact, this honestly goes hand in hand with my boat shoe prediction, right? But I think it's going to expand. It's going to expand in 2025 and more nautical fishermen elements are going to become trendy. One very specific example, yellow raincoat and yellow rain boots. Mark my words. 
[P101]  very nautical fishermen outdoorsy, okay? This is something that I want. Honestly, if this becomes trendy and brands start making yellow raincoats and yellow rain boots, I will be buying a pair of each because I'm really into this trend. I think, again, like a lot of the things that I've mentioned today are super classic and timeless. Stripes, minimalist design, 
[P102]  boots. Like those are classic pieces, right? But I think that all of these classic pieces are going to come back because of trend fatigue, right? This isn't a coincidence that a lot of these things are really classic. A yellow raincoat and yellow rain boot, it doesn't get more classic than that. Not only does it fall under the sort of nautical category, which I think is coming back anyway, but it's also timeless. I'm super into it. This is actually one of the few things that I personally will 
[P103]  be buying if I see a version of it that appeals to me because it really excites me. And if this prediction is true or even if it's not, I'm probably going to get my hands on it anyway because I really want a yellow pair of rain boots and I really want a yellow raincoat. It just is cute and I just want it. But jumping off of that, I think perhaps a pop of yellow could be the new pop of red. Last year, it was all about the pop of red. I could see a pop of yellow becoming the new pop of red. That's just a brief side note. It doesn't really have anything to do

[P28]  money, whatever. And it's impossible to have any sort of attachment or appreciation for the pieces that you have when you have more than you could ever wear. Do you know what I'm saying? So I think we're going to swing in the opposite direction and it'll become cool to be seen in your iconic pair of jeans that everybody knows are your jeans. Does that make sense? Like it'll be cooler to repeat stuff. I don't know. We'll see. That might be a pipe dream. 
[P29]  Okay, next. Gaunt makeup. By gaunt makeup, I mean no blush, no highlighter, no faux freckles. I'm talking about sharp contour, otherwise sort of even complexion, right? Like you're not adding blush. You're not adding freckles. You're not adding all this stuff. Other than that, it's just like sort of flat, not dewy, but also not matte sort of face with contour. 
[P30]  Cool tones, neutral tones, but mainly cool tones. Kind of gaunt makeup. This to me is very like 90s minimalist as well. It kind of goes hand in hand with that vibe. But it also goes hand in hand with another one of my predictions. I feel like the makeup trend for the past few years has been really sweet, really warm, really youthful, really bright, 
[P31]  happy. And I think there's going to be a shift to more of a grungier sort of darker sort of look. And, you know, I'm actually not mad about this because I've been doing my makeup like this when I do my own makeup anyway for quite a while now, mainly because I think it emphasizes my personal features the best. Like, I don't think I look good when I have a lot of blush on or when I have, you know, like highlighter on my 
[P32]  little nose and in the little corners of my eye, in the little inner corner of my eye. Like, I just don't really look good like that. In my opinion, like I look better, in my opinion, with more like Tim Burton-y kind of makeup. I like that. I mean, I also like the Tim Burton movies and I grew up watching them and loving them. And it's more of like a sort of creepy sort of vibe. And I've always loved that. So, and I feel like, you know, I have the dark circles under my eyes and I have sort of big eyes. 
[P33]  kind of maybe I wish like a Tim Burton character. I can only dream that I look like a Tim Burton character, but it's like, so I like to make myself look even more like a Tim Burton character by like not covering my dark circles with concealer, by just doing like light face makeup that just exactly matches my skin tone and is like not even noticeable. It just makes it look like I just have more even complexion than I do. Contouring the face, cool toned neutrals on the eyes, 
[P34]  mascara, and then like a deep pinky brown overlined lip. And it makes my eyes look like big and scary and the dark circle looks dark. And I like it. I just, I like it. I don't know why, but I actually think it's going to be in. And I could be wrong. Cause I mean, I've been doing it for a few years now, maybe like two or three, perhaps. I don't remember. Maybe like two years now, but I think it's going to be in. And that actually leads us to indie sleaze, which is also already,

[P118]  It's going to be out. Next, the whole soccer jersey trend, like it was such a trend to wear like international soccer jerseys. That is out. Everybody give your Argentinian soccer jersey for a team that you don't know back to your little brother who actually cares about the team. Do you know what I'm saying? Like it's done. We're not wearing those jerseys anymore unless it's genuine. If you genuinely love a certain soccer team 
[P119]  them and whatever like that's different but there was a lot of people buying soccer jerseys and other sort of similar jerseys for the sake of fashion or stealing them from their little brothers give it back you know find somebody who you know who actually likes the team and give it to them just it's it's over uh and last but not least don't get mad at me for this designer dupes there's a big trend of buying designer dupes 
[P120]  last year, which I don't think is necessarily bad. If you really love something and you can find a dupe, I'm not going to judge you. You know, that's not, it's not about like moral righteousness. I'm not saying like designer dupes are out for 2025 because they're wrong. I am not the moral police here. Okay. I think it's out because I think people are going to choose to spend that money on something unique instead. Does that make sense? 
[P121]  Like instead of buying a dupe of something, why not take that money and buy something that just costs that much? You know, that's from like a cool, small little brand that you found online or at like a flea market or something. You know what I mean? I just think designer dupes are out because I think things that are explicitly designer are out. I think if you listen to my last episode about what I think is in and out for 2025, I talked a lot about how I think flexing and extravagance and showing off wealth. 
[P122]  all of this is out. And so I think as a result, you know, designer, like buying a designer dupe is out. Like, I just don't think people are going to be wasting their money on buying a dupe or something. Like, who cares? You know, like wearing designer things that are clearly designer aren't as, I think a bit of the excitement around that is gone. There are probably so many more trend predictions that I could come up with and so many things that I think are out, but that's all I have for right now. 
[P123]  have to cut myself off or else I'll talk for nine hours. And if I keep going, I'll also just list every single possible possibility, which also makes it less fun. It's like if I just, if I predict every single possible thing, like I think the 70s are going to be in and the 80s and the 90s and the 2000s. I think they're all going to be in. Then if I get one right, it doesn't matter because I actually listed every single possible thing that could ever possibly happen. So we're going to stop here. 
[P124]  you all for listening and hanging out. I hope that you enjoyed this episode. If I said something rude about something that you like, literally allow that to strengthen your love for that particular item, right? If I came on here and said, I hate camo, I did say that. If me saying I hate camo upsets you because you love camo, allow that to further strengthen your love for camo. Say,

[P41]  skinny jeans. Everybody's debating, are the skinny jeans coming back this year? Are they not? To be honest, I haven't seen anyone really wearing skinny jeans, at least in my world or in my algorithm. Like the algorithm is not feeding me videos of people wearing skinny jeans. So I haven't seen it in action yet, but I do think this year skinny jeans are back as a part of Indie Sleaze vibes. But I don't think it's what we're all afraid of. I think we're all afraid of jeggings. That's what we're all really afraid of. 
[P42]  Skinny jeans themselves, yeah, they're not great. But I think what we're really all traumatized by is like low-waisted jeggings. That was skinny jeans at their worst form in, you know, the 2010s. That's not coming back, okay? So don't worry. We're not going to be spending 10 minutes getting our super skinny, low-waisted jeggings up our legs before work or school. Like that's never happening again, right? 
[P43]  but I do think skinny jeans are going to come back. But I think that they're actually going to be less hideous than we imagine. In fact, when I think about styling skinny jeans, I'm not repulsed, which is really frightening. Because a few years ago, if you would have asked me if skinny jeans would ever come back, I would have said maybe, but like, I will never, like, I can't even imagine it. Like, it's going to be hideous. I could see it being cool. I could see it being cool. I'm definitely thinking outside the box, 
[P44]  when I'm thinking of skinny jeans looking cool, but it's not impossible. It's not impossible. And I think it will be done this year. Am I going to participate? Probably not. Although never say never, because I might get inspired and really want to do it. And I might pick up a pair, but I doubt it. And I'm going to wait as long as possible until I'm exploding and bursting at the seams and need to wear skinny jeans, which I don't think will happen. But again, never say never. I think a very specific type of skinny jean is going to come back. Real denim, like stiff, 
[P45]  real denim that's not so skin tight to the leg that it like takes two hours to get up like reasonably tight but not like impossibly tight like what was popular in the 2010s I think timeless washes right like classic denim washes nothing that's like acid wash super ripped and distressed none of that black denim I think will be fine but like 
[P46]  No extreme denim washes. And I think it might, I think it might work. I think it might work. The only thing I'm struggling with is like what shoe perhaps tucked into a boot. Oh my God. Like a skinny jean tucked into like a moto boot. Oh my God. I'm scared. Is that going to happen? Or like a skinny jean with like a little ballet flat or like a little flat shoe of some sort. Ooh, it might happen. I don't know. I could see people talking little skinny jeans into boots. I could definitely see that. 
[P47]  I don't know. We'll have to see. It might not happen, but I definitely could see the skinny jean coming back. Anyway, Indie Sleaze, I think it's back this year. It already started in 2024, so I'm not some sort of genius for predicting that, but I think it's going to hit its peak this year. Okay, next. Micro glitter matte lipstick. Okay, close your eyes and think about the early 2000s and think about the makeup trends and think about the lipstick that the beloved women in your life were wearing.

[P5]  That's almost as bad as the sickness itself. Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy remove these painful parts of getting better with things like 24-7 virtual visits and prescriptions delivered to your door. Thanks to Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy for sponsoring today's episode. Now let's get back to the episode. We're starting out with the obvious. I've been talking about this for a while now, so this shouldn't be a shock to anyone. Minimalism. 
[P6]  a lifestyle perspective. I'm not talking about owning less clothes. I'm talking about minimalistic design, okay? Now, what is that, you may ask? Don't worry. I Googled it for you, and I have the definition right here. Minimalism is a style that prioritizes simplicity, clean lines, neutral colors, and timeless silhouettes, focusing on quality over quantity and emphasizing essential, versatile pieces rather than trendy, 
[P7]  clothing. Now, I've been talking about minimalism coming back for so long. I'm sick of talking about it, too. OK, so I won't overemphasize this point, but I think minimalism in one way or another is always in. I don't know. I even feel like the clean girl aesthetic of 2023, 2024 was kind of minimalist in a way because it was a sort of style that consisted of simplicity and clean 
[P8]  and neutral colors and timeless silhouettes. So, you know, when I say that minimalism is coming back, what comes to my mind is like 90s minimalism. Let's Google 90s minimalism. Okay, if you Google 90s minimalism, this is what comes up. I'm looking on British Vogue at an article called The Minimalist 90s Outfits Inspiring My Summer Wardrobe, just to give some examples of some minimalist outfits. 
[P9]  I see a plain white t-shirt with some simple pinstripe dress pants and a matching pinstripe dressy little vest. I see classic blue jeans. I see classic black boots. A lot of simple tank tops, t-shirts in neutral colors. Lots of black and white button down shirts.

[P35]  in, but will be even more so in, in like a big way. Indie sleaze really started to come back in 2024, but I think in 2025, it's going to reach its peak because it definitely hasn't reached its peak yet. It definitely hasn't. Let's Google what indie sleaze is so that we can all be up to date. Okay. Indie sleaze is a term that describes a style of music and fashion that was popular 
[P36]  in the United States and UK from around 2006 to 2012. The fashion was an affordable, messy, and lethargic take on vintage styles, especially from the 70s. Indy sleeves fashion is characterized by mismatched, out of proportion, and chaotic pieces. Some examples include metallic leggings, tunics, knit beanies, fedoras, and chunky costume pearls. Okay, let's fucking relax on that. I'm not... That is not what I see coming back, but I see a version of Indy sleeves coming back. 
[P37]  That means in a minute because I don't agree on all of this. The fedora is like the fedora is insane. Like that is not coming back. Knee high socks are also a key part of the indie sleaze look, whatever. A tongue in cheek style that was influenced by Brooklyn hipster fashion, 70s, 80s, electro rock music, pop art, super flat pop, whatever, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? The style grew in popularity on sites like Tumblr and MySpace and was often seen as a counterculture reaction to the economic climate of the recession. Yeah. 
[P38]  I do think that this is happening again. It's obviously not going to be exactly the same as it was in 2006 to 2012, but I think there's going to be a lot of similarities in 2025. That's my prediction. Okay. I just said the gaunt makeup, the gaunt sort of like party girl gaunt makeup, very indie sleaze to take it a step further in makeup, smudgy black eye makeup. I could see that coming, 
[P39]  back, definitely black and white stripes. To me, black and white stripes, so indie sleeves to me and I fucking love it. And to me, black and white stripes are timeless, but I think they're really going to come back and I can't wait. I'm wearing black and white stripes right now. So yeah, ripped tights, DIY cut up shirts. Like that was very indie sleeves, like cutting the sleeves off and the neck off of your own shirt and it being all like saggy and like lopsided and weird looking. The 
[P40]  Union Jack, which is the United Kingdom's flag, you know, the red, white and blue sort of star looking Union Jack. That was super indie sleaze. I think that's going to come back. I do think certain more extreme indie sleaze details will come back, potentially like a metallic legging like Google provided for me. And last but not least, I do think skinny jeans are coming back. There's been so much discourse. I can't even stay away from the discourse around

[P90]  example of what that looks like. But I could see a trend of people tying tape around their glasses, like around their reading glasses. I don't think suspenders are going to come back in. I could see, I can see this now when I close my eyes. Like imagine this outfit. This is to me is like a stereotypical sort of nerd outfit. Now, by the way, the word nerd, I don't know, like stereotyping people as nerds. 
[P91]  listen, I don't know if it's politically correct, but like everyone's a nerd in a little, in a sort of way. And by nerdy, I mean like dorky, which I think is charming. Like it's not, I'm not using the word nerd in any sort of derogatory way, but there is sort of like a stereotypical sort of nerd aesthetic, right? When I close my eyes and think about what version of nerd is going to come back in 2025, I think of the glasses with the tape wrapped around the center, you know, 
[P92]  nose bridge, right? Very stereotypical nerd. I think of a sweatshirt, maybe like just like a basic sweatshirt or a funny t-shirt that's like, maybe it doesn't fit particularly well. I think of maybe like a utilitarian pant of sorts, like a cargo pant, perhaps a cargo short, you know, things that are considered not necessarily fashionable or not necessarily 
[P93]  chic, right? Perhaps like a sort of narrow fitting shoe, like a small narrow fitting shoe, like a little sneaker that's sort of a bit nerdy, like almost like a little Merrill or like a little Keen or like a little like Adidas that's sort of narrow, like, I don't know, like a narrow, small sneaker. That's the kind of nerd that I'm imagining. And I think that that's going to be really in this year. 
[P94]  Almost like how everybody became obsessed with, like, Adam Sandler's street style. Because he would just wear, like, a dumpy pair of, like, basketball shorts and, like, an oversized T-shirt and, like, sneakers. And he just looked kind of like a mess. But everybody loved it. And I think that that's going to be back. Where it's, like, nerdy, like, computer lover vibes. Like, early 2000s nerd vibes. I see that coming back. Okay, next. Okay, hear me out. Clogs. 
[P95]  Clogs are so bad. I keep seeing people wearing clogs. Like I'm starting to see it happen. And I think 2025 is the year of the clog, which leads me to a broader prediction I have, which is sort of like gardening chef core. Okay. Now I'm not talking about cutesy little gardening, cutesy little chef. Like I actually weirdly imagine people taking inspiration from what chefs actually, 
[P96]  wear or like what you really wear gardening. You know what I'm saying? Like the utilitarian gardening gloves. OK, a utilitarian chef's waist apron. I could see these things becoming fashionable. And I think it's going to go hand in hand with, you know, gardening and cooking becoming trendy as an activity this year.

[P84]  analog clock. Everyone under the age of 40 prefers a digital watch, prefers a digital clock in general. None of us know how to read a clock under the age of 40. None of us.

I mean, you can wear the digital, like, plasticky sort of watch anywhere. In the shower, to your workout. And a lot of times they're cheaper than the metal watches, so you're not worried about them. But more importantly, it's actually a readable watch.

And there's no, there's no stress. And I actually think it looks cool. I did not think it looked cool at first when I saw this person wearing their digital watch the first time I met them. I, to be honest, I was like, I don't like it. I don't like that watch. What is that watch? Take that thing off. And then it grew on me and I was like, no, I actually think it's really, it's really genius. 
[P89]  myself I could see the digital watch coming back in which takes me to my next trend prediction nerd vibes remember in the 2010s when like it was all about nerds like everybody wanted to wear like suspenders and like glasses that had the white tape around the center like nerdcore I could see that coming back in in 2025 and I think the digital watch is like a great example

[P62]  same thing will happen with buttons where it's like, you know, a button doing its normal button function, closing a garment will always be cool. That's timeless. But buttons being in a place just for the sake of buttons, I think might not be as timeless for majority of people. And I think majority of people will get sick of buttons in that way. Except for me, because I love buttons so much and have such a personal connection to buttons. 
[P63]  And it will never be wrong. To me, a button is never wrong. Next. So this is not necessarily like a fashion trend in the sense of like clothing or makeup or whatever. This is more of like a physical human body trend, which listen, I'm not saying that we should have body related trends. Okay. I don't think, I don't think that that's great. Right. 
[P64]  However it's the case. For the last few years, the trend has been sort of Barbie doll aesthetic. You know what I mean? Looking like a Barbie doll. Being perfectly symmetrical, having plump lips, having plump cheekbones, having the perfect little nose. Like people, you know, many, many, many, many, many, many, many people were going and, you know, getting cosmetic procedures done to accomplish this look. 
[P65]  a trend to get certain procedures done. Right. Well, I actually think that that's over. I think everyone looking the same like a little Barbie doll. I think that that's out. And listen, I'm not trying to shit on anyone who looks that way or who has, you know, chosen to go get those procedures or do whatever. Like, I get it. OK, I get it. If that's what you like or that's what you liked in the past, it's none of my business. It's up to you what you do with your face or body. 
[P66]  or whatever. I don't care. But I think it's gotten to the point now where everybody's sort of getting the same procedures done, right? Everybody's getting their lips done. A lot of people are getting rhinoplasty, he's getting their nose done. A lot of people are getting filler and Botox in the same areas, right? There's sort of become a trend of getting these certain procedures done. And what's ended up happening is a lot of people look the same. Oh my God, veneers, like getting veneers, super trendy, fake teeth that are super 
[P67]  perfect, this has become a trend, perfection, right? And now we have a lot of people who have a very similar nose and have very similar teeth and have a very similar jawline and have a very similar, you know, whatever. Listen, we're all different, but like there's definitely a lot of similarities. And so I think as a response to that, it's going to become trendy to have aesthetic quirks about your look. Now, listen, 
[P68]  In an ideal world, it would be a trend to have your own unique quirks, whatever those may be, right? So like everybody's different, meaning everybody has their own unique quirks and those are all inherently trendy. Unfortunately, that's not how our society works. I see it being like cherry picked sorts of quirks. You know what I'm saying? Like having a gap in your teeth, trendy. I could see that being trendy. I could even see people going in, 
[P69]  they don't have any quirks, going and getting quirks manufactured, going and getting a gap in your in your teeth, like going to get it grinded. Can you even do that? I don't know. Get the gap grinded down so that you have a gap in your teeth or like, you know, getting an ear implant so that your ears look unique or like getting freckles tattooed or shaving off your eyebrows. I can't explain this, but I just see a trend happening where looking

[P48]  shimmery. It was light pink. It was micro glitters. It was like almost holographic. I think that that's coming back. You know, I was thinking about the makeup that my mom wore when I was a kid randomly the other day, like completely randomly, like I was daydreaming and that just popped into my head. And I was like, that lipstick is definitely going to come back. I just had this gut feeling. And then like a week or two later, I was watching 
[P49]  the first episode of Sex and the City for the first time, actually, because I've never watched that show. My friends were watching the first episode of Sex and the City, and I noticed that the main character was wearing that type of lipstick. And I was like, whoa, there it is again. I totally see it. Micro glitter, shimmer, matte lipstick, early 2000s lipstick vibe. Just, I don't know. I see it coming back. I see it coming back. Okay, next. 
[P50]  random. This is literally so random. Polka dots. Yeah. Polka dots. Listen, you'll notice that I'm saying a lot of timeless, classic, obvious patterns. Stripes I mentioned earlier. Polka dots I'm mentioning now. I'm going to mention stripes probably one or two more times because I think stripes are really going to be in this year. I know what you're thinking. Emma, these are the most obvious, timeless patterns. I know. But I think that that's 
[P51]  why they're going to be in this year. I think we all have such trend fatigue from keeping up with trends for the past few years. We're so exhausted with the speed of trend cycles. I think a lot of people are going to be making timeless choices this year, almost out of necessity. Like, oh my God, what can I buy that I can wear for more than six months without getting bored of it? You know? And so I think classic patterns like stripes and polka dots are going to be in. But specifically, 
[P52]  we're talking about polka dots right now. I actually, I usually get red nails when I go to the nail salon. I just always get red nails. But the last time I was there, I got little polka dots because I really do believe that polka dots are going to be stylish again. I think that they're always stylish, but I think it's going to be one of those patterns that we're not going to be able to get away from. Luckily, I think if you buy something polka dot now, you'll be able to wear it forever. 
[P53]  Because I do think that polka dots are very timeless. But I do think we might get a little bit bored of polka dots by the end of this year. I could see that happening. If they do fully come back to the extent that I think that they will. But I personally love polka dots. Like I'm actually really excited. And I don't know. I think like polka dot tights, polka dot, like a black and white polka dot jacket, like trench coat, little pops of polka dots here and there. 
[P54]  I think is going to be in. We'll see. Next, asymmetrical stuff. This is something I'm predicting because I've been seeing it pop up more and more on Pinterest. And I actually have a few asymmetrical pieces in my closet that I've collected over the years. So it definitely has been in already for the last few years, but I think it's going to be mainstream this year. I think it's going to be huge. Like everything's going to be asymmetrical. And by asymmetrical,

And I think the opposite is going to become trendy. So people who already have a gap in their teeth or already have a bunch of freckles or already have a mole on their lip or have a birthmark on their face, like these things are going to be really celebrated. And at times,

Like, could you go to a dentist and say like, I want to get a gap in my teeth like Madonna? Does she have a gap in her teeth? I think she does. Yeah. Like I want a Madonna gap in my teeth. Would the dentist do it? Probably. Um, I don't know. 
[P72]  that might be far-fetched, but I could kind of see it. Okay. Next 60s mod it's in. There's a lot of different little elements of the 1960s mod aesthetic that I think are going to come back. Some of them are going to be isolated. Like, okay. How do I explain this? Like, I don't think people are going to be like dressing up like a 1960s mod Halloween costume. Okay. 
[P73]  But I think a lot of elements of the 1960s mod aesthetic are going to come back on their own, if that makes sense. So I'm not saying this whole aesthetic is going to come back into style altogether all at once. I just think a lot of these things are going to be trendy and it's not going to be in like a in like a Halloween costume sort of way. Does that make sense? Because if you were to Google 1960s mod, you'd see a very specific sort of aesthetic, right? 
[P74]  style top in skirt, lots of color blocking, lots of classic patterns, dramatic big collars and buttons, very kitschy, very of the 1960s, right? It looks very 1960s. I don't think it's going to be that on the nose. And I don't think that like the 1960s mod aesthetic is going to come back all at once, all at the same time. Does that make sense? But there are many key elements from that era that I think are going to come back. 
[P75]  for one, the pixie haircut. The pixie haircut on women was very popular in the 60s. I think it's coming back. Now, listen, I know a lot of you are thinking, Emma, you just cut all your hair off. You got a pixie. So that's why you're saying that you think the pixie's back.

I love having short hair. I think it's coming back, number one, because it's really chic, honestly. When done right, it is really chic, number one. Number two, low maintenance and easy. It is so freeing. And I think a lot of women are going to be, 
[P77]  I don't know, like if they see other women doing it, they'll feel invited to do it themselves too. Because it's really scary to go and get a pixie haircut when it's not trending. I'll tell you, it's really scary because it's a risky haircut. But if other people start doing it, I think it's going to become, I don't know, it's like a domino effect. The more people that have a pixie haircut, the more people that will feel empowered to do it themselves. And it's so cool to me and it's so comfortable and fun to style. 
[P78]  I don't know. I just think the pixie's great and I think it's going to come back. Another 1960s mod vibe, color blocking. A technique that involves wearing multiple solid colored clothing items in an outfit, often in complimentary colors. This sort of goes hand in hand with the idea of minimalist design, sort of white t-shirt, black pant, black sweater with the white, you know what I mean? Like very simple color blocking, easy on the eyes. Those two things go hand in hand in my mind. 
[P79]  I think this sort of simplicity is going to be really appealing this year, especially because I think the concept of having a lot of simple pieces and building more intricate outfits using a bunch of simple pieces is going to be really in this year because it's a more sustainable way to play with fashion, whereas constantly shopping and buying new unique pieces and making outfits with them once or twice and then donating them. Like, I just think people are going to get sick of that. 
[P80]  cadence of buying and donating and buying and donating and dealing with clutter and stuff like that. So I think the concept of color blocking is going to work really well. You know, you can wear a green t-shirt with a pair of blue pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of brown pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of orange pants. And you know what I mean? And it's, it's always, it's going to bring a different feeling every single time because it's a different combination of clothes, but that was all just with one shirt. 
[P81]  You put a little vest over that shirt. Now it feels different. It's like, I think layering and color blocking is going to be in, which is definitely very 1960s mod. Also classic patterns, stripes, polka dots, plaids, like simple timeless patterns that are always in. Very 60s mod. I think that'll be in. Simple minimalist designs are very 1960s mod. 
[P82]  just classic silhouettes that we all know and love, especially with like little skirts and dresses, timeless. And you can't go wrong. I started seeing 60s mod silhouettes on the runway like last year. And I was like, oh man, that's really going to come back in a big way. And it hasn't fully come back yet, but I think this is the year that it will. And last but not least, more modest silhouettes. I feel like the 1960s,

And I think every single thing that we experimented with last year is just absolutely over this year. Every trend that popped up last year, we wore to death.

Okay. Almost like period dressing, not like period dressing, like, oh, I'm about to have my period. So I'm wearing black pants so that I don't stain my pants. I mean, like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I don't even know what the term for that would be, but you get the idea. Over the last few years, 
[P113]  There's been moments where it's been trendy to dress exactly like a certain era on the nose. OK, like Y2K on the nose. That was really trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 90s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing really 70s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 80s on the nose. This is all within the last five years. OK, at any point in time over the last five years,

Like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I think that that's out completely. And I know that I mentioned 90s minimalism and I know that I mentioned 60s mod as being in, but I more mean elements from those time periods. I don't mean like dressing exactly

[P116]  dress exactly Y2K, exactly 90s, exactly 70s. You know what I mean? Even exactly 60s mod, even though I think a lot of elements of the 60s mod are going to be in. I think if you dress up like you're somebody in the 60s mod era, it's going to look costumey. And I think that that's not going to fly in 2025. Next camo. Camo is so done. It's done. Unless you're literally like a deer hunter, 
[P117]  or you're in the army. Like, no, if you're just, if you're like, like a little fashion kid in New York wearing the camo, I think that might be out. I think that might be out.

[P16]  buy, you know, good basics and stuff. Like I think that's going to be really in and styling them in unique ways that have sort of magic. I think that's going to be in, but I don't think it's something we're ever going to look back at and cringe at, which is cool. It's cool when a trend also is timeless and it's rare. So I think this is one of the rare times when something timeless will be trendy. Moving on. Okay. So in 2024, the concept of 
[P17]  Jane Birkening your bag. Are we remembering this? This is the concept of taking your purse and attaching a bunch of personalized objects onto it, tying a bandana onto it, putting little charms on it, attaching jewelry to it, inspired by Jane Birken of the 60s, who carried around her iconic Birken bag that she attached a bunch of little accessories to that were personal to her. 
[P18]  and then gets a bit warm and then ties it around her purse to give her neck some air. That's the idea, right? Organically and authentically accessorizing her purse through necessity and convenience, weirdly enough, became a trend in 2024 where everybody was buying charms and finding bandanas and things in their drawers and then adding it to their bag to make it look authentic like Jane Birkin's bag. Fascinating trend. 
[P19]  think it's ending in 2025. I think it's going to expand in 2025. In 2024, it was all about the bag, right? Accessorizing the bag in that way. I think in 2025, it's about doing that with everything, okay? Your favorite hat, put a bunch of pins on it. Embroider a heart into it. Put a patch on it. On your jacket, there's a rip. You sew it with contrasting thread. Let's say it's a black jacket. You fix the 
[P20]  the rip with white thick thread, you know, you put pins on it, you put patches on it, your favorite pair of jeans, you put little accessories on the belt loops. You again, put patches, sew up the holes with bright thread, you know, paint your name onto the pocket, like accessorize, accessorize, accessorize with shoes, paint on your shoes. Like you get what I'm saying? Like making your pieces, 
[P21]  really, really unique to you. Because I think that what's going on right now is that a lot of people are craving a sense of personal style. And I've seen a lot of discourse around personal style and how personal style is sort of dead because of the internet. Whether or not that's true, that's a conversation for another day. But I think this idea of personalization is going to give people the feeling of personal style. Because

[P99]  white chef's hat? No, but I don't know. Listen, this is how I feel and it could be totally off base, but I just, I don't know. That's what my gut is telling me. Clogs, aprons, utilitarian gardener, utilitarian chef, you know? Ah, fuck. I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Last but not least, nautical vibes. Okay. The ocean, the sea, fishermen, the whole thing. And this, 
[P100]  This has been rumbling under the surface for a while now. In fact, this honestly goes hand in hand with my boat shoe prediction, right? But I think it's going to expand. It's going to expand in 2025 and more nautical fishermen elements are going to become trendy. One very specific example, yellow raincoat and yellow rain boots. Mark my words. 
[P101]  very nautical fishermen outdoorsy, okay? This is something that I want. Honestly, if this becomes trendy and brands start making yellow raincoats and yellow rain boots, I will be buying a pair of each because I'm really into this trend. I think, again, like a lot of the things that I've mentioned today are super classic and timeless. Stripes, minimalist design, 
[P102]  boots. Like those are classic pieces, right? But I think that all of these classic pieces are going to come back because of trend fatigue, right? This isn't a coincidence that a lot of these things are really classic. A yellow raincoat and yellow rain boot, it doesn't get more classic than that. Not only does it fall under the sort of nautical category, which I think is coming back anyway, but it's also timeless. I'm super into it. This is actually one of the few things that I personally will 
[P103]  be buying if I see a version of it that appeals to me because it really excites me. And if this prediction is true or even if it's not, I'm probably going to get my hands on it anyway because I really want a yellow pair of rain boots and I really want a yellow raincoat. It just is cute and I just want it. But jumping off of that, I think perhaps a pop of yellow could be the new pop of red. Last year, it was all about the pop of red. I could see a pop of yellow becoming the new pop of red. That's just a brief side note. It doesn't really have anything to do

[P1] ﻿ About a year ago, I predicted the boat shoe trend. Yeah, I did. And can I be honest? Since then, I've been chasing that feeling. The feeling of predicting a trend and then seeing it in the real world, I imagine rivals the feeling of seeing your newborn baby for the first time. Like, I think I'll probably feel that excited again on the day that I give birth to my first child. That's the next time I'll feel that level of satisfaction, unless, 
[P2]  I'm able to successfully predict another trend before that, which is what I'm going to try to do today. Today, I am going to share with you my 2025 fashion trend predictions. If I can get even one of these right, I'll be able to match that feeling I got when I predicted the boat shoe coming back. But I'm being realistic here. I don't have a crystal ball. Some of these predictions are random gut feelings. 
[P3]  are based on what I've studied sort of starting to become popular over the past few years, but haven't fully gone mainstream yet. And I predict that this year they will go mainstream. So it's a combination of gut feelings and educated guesses. The educated guesses are less satisfying if they come true because it's like I saw it coming in the world, right? The gut feelings, those, if they come true, 
[P4]  more rewarding. So hopefully, well, whatever. I'll just be happy if I get anything right. So let's begin. 2025 fashion trend predictions. I briefly paused this episode of Anything Goes to let you know that this episode of Anything Goes is presented by Amazon. Getting sick is horrible enough. The getting better part shouldn't be horrible too. Waiting on hold for an appointment, sitting in crowded waiting rooms,

输入内容：
[P22]  you can have the same pair of jeans as somebody else. In fact, you probably do. What sets you apart is how you personalize them. What sets them apart is that it's the pair that is your favorite that you wear three days a week. You know, this idea of really personalizing your items and having less items as well. Because I think prior to recently, it's been all about having a lot of stuff, having a lot of clothes, especially if you're into fashion, having as many options as possible so that you can constantly 
[P23]  be wearing a new outfit. That was sort of trendy, right? For many years to always be wearing a new outfit, to never wear the same outfit twice. I think that that's out. And I think having signature pieces that are super personalized that you wear over and over and over again and you style a multitude of ways, I think that's in. I even thought about it in terms of the Stanley Cup, which is not really a fashionable thing. That's more of like a pop culture obsession. 
[P24]  a Stanley Cup. I have a Stanley Cup. But I even thought about it like this. Like, this is almost a metaphor for what I mean for fashion in like clothing and stuff. It's the idea of like, instead of having every single color of Stanley Cup, instead of having the bright pink one and the blue one and the sparkly white one and the brown one and the orange one and the green one, you just have one that's your favorite color and you put stickers on it. You take your watch 
[P25]  the middle of the day and you attach it to your Stanley cup and you, it's like truly a utilitarian, like fully functional item. And it is your personal favorite item. It becomes a special thing to you. If you only have one and the one that you do have, you use every day or very consistently. And it looks like you, it becomes your iconic Stanley cup. That I think is going to be cool. That's going to be the way that we 
[P26]  consume, I think, in 2025. Instead of having nine pairs of jeans, you have two and they're both really special. And they're known as like, oh, those are Emma's jeans. Like if somebody were to see your signature pair of jeans on a mannequin in a store, they'd be like, wait, those are what? Those are Emma's jeans. You see what I'm saying here? 
[P27]  re-wear over and over and over again. I honestly love this idea and hope that it ends up happening because I think something that a lot of us are missing, especially those of us who love fashion and love to participate in fashion, is a sort of attachment to our belongings, our clothing, our accessories. Nowadays, it's about buying more by whatever means necessary, thrifting, buying online for really cheap,

[P81]  You put a little vest over that shirt. Now it feels different. It's like, I think layering and color blocking is going to be in, which is definitely very 1960s mod. Also classic patterns, stripes, polka dots, plaids, like simple timeless patterns that are always in. Very 60s mod. I think that'll be in. Simple minimalist designs are very 1960s mod. 
[P82]  just classic silhouettes that we all know and love, especially with like little skirts and dresses, timeless. And you can't go wrong. I started seeing 60s mod silhouettes on the runway like last year. And I was like, oh man, that's really going to come back in a big way. And it hasn't fully come back yet, but I think this is the year that it will. And last but not least, more modest silhouettes. I feel like the 1960s, 
[P83]  2020's aesthetic was very classy, very modest. And I could see that coming back, weirdly enough. Like a longer skirt, a boxier fit, not skin tight. I think that's going to be in. Yeah. Okay, moving on from 1960s mod, the digital watch. The digital watch. 
[P84]  analog clock. Everyone under the age of 40 prefers a digital watch, prefers a digital clock in general. None of us know how to read a clock under the age of 40. None of us. And if we do, it takes us at least five minutes to read the fucking clock. 5, 10, 15, 20. Oh, wait, what's the longhand do? It's not good. Digital watches are fucking back. You know, it was all about having like a chic wrist stack, 
[P85]  with like a beautiful Cartier watch or like a beautiful Rolex or whatever, or like a beautiful metal watch. You know, that was very trendy for a while there. Don't get me wrong. I actually do think that a lot of times those pieces of jewelry are timeless, but I think it's going to become cool to wear like a plastic Casio digital watch. In fact, I've been wearing one for the past few months, inspired by someone in my life who does wear a digital watch. Okay. 
[P86]  story, actually. This came from somebody in my life who wears a digital watch. They're the only person I know who wears a digital watch. And I remember the first day I met this person, I saw them and they were wearing a digital watch. And I remember looking at it and thinking to myself, what the fuck is going on? They're wearing a big plastic digital watch. And I was like, I have not seen somebody wear a digital watch like this who's under the age of 60. Like in, 
[P87]  Maybe ever. Like, I'm shocked by this. And as I got to know this person, I was like, hold on a minute. They're a fucking genius, to be honest. The digital watch is weatherproof. I mean, you can wear the digital, like, plasticky sort of watch anywhere. In the shower, to your workout. And a lot of times they're cheaper than the metal watches, so you're not worried about them. But more importantly, it's actually a readable watch. 
[P88]  the digital, like I just look at my wrist now that I've been wearing this rubber digital watch for the last like six months. I just look at my wrist and I know exactly what time it is. And there's no, there's no stress. And I actually think it looks cool. I did not think it looked cool at first when I saw this person wearing their digital watch the first time I met them. I, to be honest, I was like, I don't like it. I don't like that watch. What is that watch? Take that thing off. And then it grew on me and I was like, no, I actually think it's really, it's really genius.

Red and white stripe, nautical aesthetic. I think a nautical stripe is going to be really in, which I absolutely love.

Cap?

It's a no brim hat, brimless hat. 
[P108]  those are in. I actually almost bought a brimless hat like six months ago. I didn't end up buying it because the material was a little bit too cheap for my liking, but I've had my eye on those for a while now and I think they're going to be in. And last but not least, in the world of nautical fashion, this is not very fisherman aesthetic. This is not very, it's not even that nautical, like it is nautical, but it's like, it's a bit more elevated

Like a chic, classic pearl. I don't know. I could see it happening. Okay. That is what I think is going to be in in 2025. If I literally get one of those predictions correct, I will be so stoked. I mean, the truth of the matter is, 
[P110]  lot of those predictions aren't even fully predictions because a lot of them are already starting to pop up now or like they already were popping up last year, but maybe they just weren't mainstream yet. And I think they're going to go mainstream this year. And then some things were more random, but we shall see. Here's what I think is going to go out of style in 2025.

主题：苍白妆容的回归

输入内容：
[P59]  a button tattooed on my arm. So I'm worried that it's going to become trendy to put buttons on everything and then everyone's going to start to hate buttons. And then my tattoo of a button is going to look cringe and basic. Not that there's anything wrong with being basic, but I have a button tattoo on my arm because my favorite movie is Coraline and the button is one of the main symbols of the movie. And so that's why I have a button on my arm. 
[P60]  And that's why I love buttons so much. Also, just because they're freaking cute. They're so cute. Anyway, the reason why I think buttons are the new bows, though, is because similar to a bow, like bows are absolutely timeless. A bow is a bow. It's too crucial of a design element to not be timeless. Like bows will always exist. Bows will always be in. You know what I mean? 
[P61]  will be. But I think the same thing that happened with bows will happen with buttons where we put bows on everything, right? Everybody was tying ribbon around everything. Everybody was, you know, attaching little bows to everything. Brands were coming out with stuff that just had bows all over it. There's just so many bows. It was like, oh my God, we need to stop with the bows. They're not serving a purpose. They're just here and it's stale. It became stale very quickly. 
[P62]  same thing will happen with buttons where it's like, you know, a button doing its normal button function, closing a garment will always be cool. That's timeless. But buttons being in a place just for the sake of buttons, I think might not be as timeless for majority of people. And I think majority of people will get sick of buttons in that way. Except for me, because I love buttons so much and have such a personal connection to buttons. 
[P63]  And it will never be wrong. To me, a button is never wrong. Next. So this is not necessarily like a fashion trend in the sense of like clothing or makeup or whatever. This is more of like a physical human body trend, which listen, I'm not saying that we should have body related trends. Okay. I don't think, I don't think that that's great. Right. 
[P64]  However it's the case. For the last few years, the trend has been sort of Barbie doll aesthetic. You know what I mean? Looking like a Barbie doll. Being perfectly symmetrical, having plump lips, having plump cheekbones, having the perfect little nose. Like people, you know, many, many, many, many, many, many, many people were going and, you know, getting cosmetic procedures done to accomplish this look. 
[P65]  a trend to get certain procedures done. Right. Well, I actually think that that's over. I think everyone looking the same like a little Barbie doll. I think that that's out. And listen, I'm not trying to shit on anyone who looks that way or who has, you know, chosen to go get those procedures or do whatever. Like, I get it. OK, I get it. If that's what you like or that's what you liked in the past, it's none of my business. It's up to you what you do with your face or body.

主题：极简主义设计的回归

输入内容：
[P6]  a lifestyle perspective. I'm not talking about owning less clothes. I'm talking about minimalistic design, okay? Now, what is that, you may ask? Don't worry. I Googled it for you, and I have the definition right here. Minimalism is a style that prioritizes simplicity, clean lines, neutral colors, and timeless silhouettes, focusing on quality over quantity and emphasizing essential, versatile pieces rather than trendy, 
[P7]  clothing. Now, I've been talking about minimalism coming back for so long. I'm sick of talking about it, too. OK, so I won't overemphasize this point, but I think minimalism in one way or another is always in. I don't know. I even feel like the clean girl aesthetic of 2023, 2024 was kind of minimalist in a way because it was a sort of style that consisted of simplicity and clean 
[P8]  and neutral colors and timeless silhouettes. So, you know, when I say that minimalism is coming back, what comes to my mind is like 90s minimalism. Let's Google 90s minimalism. Okay, if you Google 90s minimalism, this is what comes up. I'm looking on British Vogue at an article called The Minimalist 90s Outfits Inspiring My Summer Wardrobe, just to give some examples of some minimalist outfits. 
[P9]  I see a plain white t-shirt with some simple pinstripe dress pants and a matching pinstripe dressy little vest. I see classic blue jeans. I see classic black boots. A lot of simple tank tops, t-shirts in neutral colors. Lots of black and white button down shirts. 
[P10]  simple dress pants or capris, classic just suit jackets, blazers, simple dresses that aren't super tight in neutral colors, lots of black boots, lots of plain, simple, flat loafers, black, white, brown. I mean, yeah, it's just, it's like, it's very, it's simple, but it does still have swag. And the swag element is what's really 
[P11]  really hard to put a finger on. Somehow 90s minimalism, when you Google it, it doesn't look boring. There's magic happening with it somehow. I don't know. I see 90s minimalism really being the main trend this year. And here's the thing. The truth of the matter is minimalism in clothing design is timeless. Like a white button down, a pair of blue jeans, a pair of black slacks, a pair of little simple black loafers, a black boot. 
[P12]  a white t-shirt. These things are never out. They are always in. So a lot of people I've seen online saying like, minimalism is just another trend. It's not preventing people from buying more stuff. People are going to buy minimalist design. And then when that's out, they're going to go and they're going to buy maximalist design again. Minimalist stuff is just as trendy as maximalist stuff. I actually disagree. There's kind of a debate happening on the internet around 
[P13]  whether or not minimalist designs are timeless, whether or not they come in and out of style. I definitely do think they have trendy moments, but I think unlike maximalist designs, they're always in and no one can change my mind. Okay. I think minimalist design is really going to be in, in 2025, but it's never going to be out because it's too simple to ever be in or out. You know what I'm saying? If you were doing sort of the clean girl aesthetic, 
[P14]  2024, 2023, 2024, which consisted of, you know, the slick back bun, the trench coats, the dress pants, the little loafers, the little button up shirts. It's just very like chic and classy. Literally, just by styling that slightly different, maybe doing your hair a little bit different, maybe accessorizing a little bit differently, you now have 90s minimalism, right? And then in a few years when there's a new sort of minimalist style that's in, you can, 
[P15]  reuse those pieces again. I just, I really do think when it comes to trends, any sort of minimalist trend to me is the safest one to buy into because you actually can reuse those pieces in a million different ways. So I think investing in good minimalist pieces, I would be shocked if you regretted it, you know, unless you're just a maximalist at heart and you don't like clothes like that. Fair enough.

[P43]  but I do think skinny jeans are going to come back. But I think that they're actually going to be less hideous than we imagine. In fact, when I think about styling skinny jeans, I'm not repulsed, which is really frightening. Because a few years ago, if you would have asked me if skinny jeans would ever come back, I would have said maybe, but like, I will never, like, I can't even imagine it. Like, it's going to be hideous. I could see it being cool. I could see it being cool. I'm definitely thinking outside the box, 
[P44]  when I'm thinking of skinny jeans looking cool, but it's not impossible. It's not impossible. And I think it will be done this year. Am I going to participate? Probably not. Although never say never, because I might get inspired and really want to do it. And I might pick up a pair, but I doubt it. And I'm going to wait as long as possible until I'm exploding and bursting at the seams and need to wear skinny jeans, which I don't think will happen. But again, never say never. I think a very specific type of skinny jean is going to come back. Real denim, like stiff, 
[P45]  real denim that's not so skin tight to the leg that it like takes two hours to get up like reasonably tight but not like impossibly tight like what was popular in the 2010s I think timeless washes right like classic denim washes nothing that's like acid wash super ripped and distressed none of that black denim I think will be fine but like 
[P46]  No extreme denim washes. And I think it might, I think it might work. I think it might work. The only thing I'm struggling with is like what shoe perhaps tucked into a boot. Oh my God. Like a skinny jean tucked into like a moto boot. Oh my God. I'm scared. Is that going to happen? Or like a skinny jean with like a little ballet flat or like a little flat shoe of some sort. Ooh, it might happen. I don't know. I could see people talking little skinny jeans into boots. I could definitely see that. 
[P47]  I don't know. We'll have to see. It might not happen, but I definitely could see the skinny jean coming back. Anyway, Indie Sleaze, I think it's back this year. It already started in 2024, so I'm not some sort of genius for predicting that, but I think it's going to hit its peak this year. Okay, next. Micro glitter matte lipstick. Okay, close your eyes and think about the early 2000s and think about the makeup trends and think about the lipstick that the beloved women in your life were wearing. 
[P48]  shimmery. It was light pink. It was micro glitters. It was like almost holographic. I think that that's coming back. You know, I was thinking about the makeup that my mom wore when I was a kid randomly the other day, like completely randomly, like I was daydreaming and that just popped into my head. And I was like, that lipstick is definitely going to come back. I just had this gut feeling. And then like a week or two later, I was watching 
[P49]  the first episode of Sex and the City for the first time, actually, because I've never watched that show. My friends were watching the first episode of Sex and the City, and I noticed that the main character was wearing that type of lipstick. And I was like, whoa, there it is again. I totally see it. Micro glitter, shimmer, matte lipstick, early 2000s lipstick vibe. Just, I don't know. I see it coming back. I see it coming back. Okay, next. 
[P50]  random. This is literally so random. Polka dots. Yeah. Polka dots. Listen, you'll notice that I'm saying a lot of timeless, classic, obvious patterns. Stripes I mentioned earlier. Polka dots I'm mentioning now. I'm going to mention stripes probably one or two more times because I think stripes are really going to be in this year. I know what you're thinking. Emma, these are the most obvious, timeless patterns. I know. But I think that that's

[P51]  why they're going to be in this year. I think we all have such trend fatigue from keeping up with trends for the past few years. We're so exhausted with the speed of trend cycles. I think a lot of people are going to be making timeless choices this year, almost out of necessity. Like, oh my God, what can I buy that I can wear for more than six months without getting bored of it? You know? And so I think classic patterns like stripes and polka dots are going to be in. But specifically, 
[P52]  we're talking about polka dots right now. I actually, I usually get red nails when I go to the nail salon. I just always get red nails. But the last time I was there, I got little polka dots because I really do believe that polka dots are going to be stylish again. I think that they're always stylish, but I think it's going to be one of those patterns that we're not going to be able to get away from. Luckily, I think if you buy something polka dot now, you'll be able to wear it forever. 
[P53]  Because I do think that polka dots are very timeless. But I do think we might get a little bit bored of polka dots by the end of this year. I could see that happening. If they do fully come back to the extent that I think that they will. But I personally love polka dots. Like I'm actually really excited. And I don't know. I think like polka dot tights, polka dot, like a black and white polka dot jacket, like trench coat, little pops of polka dots here and there. 
[P54]  I think is going to be in. We'll see. Next, asymmetrical stuff. This is something I'm predicting because I've been seeing it pop up more and more on Pinterest. And I actually have a few asymmetrical pieces in my closet that I've collected over the years. So it definitely has been in already for the last few years, but I think it's going to be mainstream this year. I think it's going to be huge. Like everything's going to be asymmetrical. And by asymmetrical, 
[P55]  I mean, like, let's say you have a little sweater. Instead of the buttons going down the middle, the buttons are going down the left side of the sweater. Or even weird shit, like a shirt where one sleeve is long and one sleeve is short. Or a skirt where, like, the left side of the skirt is long and the right side of the skirt is, like, a foot shorter. Or a seam that goes down a weird part of the shirt. Or, like, do you see what I'm saying? Asymmetrical stuff. 
[P56]  asymmetry is going to be in. I think to take it a step further, minimalist design that is asymmetrical. So like a classic white button down, but the buttons are like on the left side. Do you see what I'm saying? That is going to be so in. Taking like minimalist design and then really just making it asymmetrical. Oh man, people are going to love that. Okay, next. Buttons are the new bows. Yeah, I think that. And I'm frightened. 
[P57]  I'm frightened because I love buttons. To me, buttons are timeless, but I think that they're going to be used as a textural element instead of as a functional element, right? Like buttons are technically used on a garment as sort of a closure mechanism, right? Buttons are used to close the garment, right? I think buttons are going to become trendy to the point where there's buttons everywhere on shit. Buttons don't even need to be there. 
[P58]  a purpose where they are. And can I be honest? I love this. And I think it's timeless. And I think it might become trendy, but I don't even care because I'm going to love that for the rest of my life. I hope it becomes trendy because then I'm going to buy up all the cool stuff. No, I'm not. I'm trying to not have a shopping addiction this year or ever again for the rest of my life. So I will not buy it up. Maybe I'll buy one special button item. But I am

[P73]  But I think a lot of elements of the 1960s mod aesthetic are going to come back on their own, if that makes sense. So I'm not saying this whole aesthetic is going to come back into style altogether all at once. I just think a lot of these things are going to be trendy and it's not going to be in like a in like a Halloween costume sort of way. Does that make sense? Because if you were to Google 1960s mod, you'd see a very specific sort of aesthetic, right? 
[P74]  style top in skirt, lots of color blocking, lots of classic patterns, dramatic big collars and buttons, very kitschy, very of the 1960s, right? It looks very 1960s. I don't think it's going to be that on the nose. And I don't think that like the 1960s mod aesthetic is going to come back all at once, all at the same time. Does that make sense? But there are many key elements from that era that I think are going to come back. 
[P75]  for one, the pixie haircut. The pixie haircut on women was very popular in the 60s. I think it's coming back. Now, listen, I know a lot of you are thinking, Emma, you just cut all your hair off. You got a pixie. So that's why you're saying that you think the pixie's back. But meanwhile, Emma, you look like Ellen DeGeneres. Yeah, I know. Okay. Everyone's saying I look like fucking Ellen DeGeneres since I got my little blonde pixie. All good. I still think the 
[P76]  is coming back. And I don't think I believe that just because I have a pixie and because I plan on having a pixie for the next indefinitely. Like I have no plans to grow my hair back out. I love having short hair. I think it's coming back, number one, because it's really chic, honestly. When done right, it is really chic, number one. Number two, low maintenance and easy. It is so freeing. And I think a lot of women are going to be, 
[P77]  I don't know, like if they see other women doing it, they'll feel invited to do it themselves too. Because it's really scary to go and get a pixie haircut when it's not trending. I'll tell you, it's really scary because it's a risky haircut. But if other people start doing it, I think it's going to become, I don't know, it's like a domino effect. The more people that have a pixie haircut, the more people that will feel empowered to do it themselves. And it's so cool to me and it's so comfortable and fun to style. 
[P78]  I don't know. I just think the pixie's great and I think it's going to come back. Another 1960s mod vibe, color blocking. A technique that involves wearing multiple solid colored clothing items in an outfit, often in complimentary colors. This sort of goes hand in hand with the idea of minimalist design, sort of white t-shirt, black pant, black sweater with the white, you know what I mean? Like very simple color blocking, easy on the eyes. Those two things go hand in hand in my mind. 
[P79]  I think this sort of simplicity is going to be really appealing this year, especially because I think the concept of having a lot of simple pieces and building more intricate outfits using a bunch of simple pieces is going to be really in this year because it's a more sustainable way to play with fashion, whereas constantly shopping and buying new unique pieces and making outfits with them once or twice and then donating them. Like, I just think people are going to get sick of that. 
[P80]  cadence of buying and donating and buying and donating and dealing with clutter and stuff like that. So I think the concept of color blocking is going to work really well. You know, you can wear a green t-shirt with a pair of blue pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of brown pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of orange pants. And you know what I mean? And it's, it's always, it's going to bring a different feeling every single time because it's a different combination of clothes, but that was all just with one shirt.

[P66]  or whatever. I don't care. But I think it's gotten to the point now where everybody's sort of getting the same procedures done, right? Everybody's getting their lips done. A lot of people are getting rhinoplasty, he's getting their nose done. A lot of people are getting filler and Botox in the same areas, right? There's sort of become a trend of getting these certain procedures done. And what's ended up happening is a lot of people look the same. Oh my God, veneers, like getting veneers, super trendy, fake teeth that are super 
[P67]  perfect, this has become a trend, perfection, right? And now we have a lot of people who have a very similar nose and have very similar teeth and have a very similar jawline and have a very similar, you know, whatever. Listen, we're all different, but like there's definitely a lot of similarities. And so I think as a response to that, it's going to become trendy to have aesthetic quirks about your look. Now, listen, 
[P68]  In an ideal world, it would be a trend to have your own unique quirks, whatever those may be, right? So like everybody's different, meaning everybody has their own unique quirks and those are all inherently trendy. Unfortunately, that's not how our society works. I see it being like cherry picked sorts of quirks. You know what I'm saying? Like having a gap in your teeth, trendy. I could see that being trendy. I could even see people going in, 
[P69]  they don't have any quirks, going and getting quirks manufactured, going and getting a gap in your in your teeth, like going to get it grinded. Can you even do that? I don't know. Get the gap grinded down so that you have a gap in your teeth or like, you know, getting an ear implant so that your ears look unique or like getting freckles tattooed or shaving off your eyebrows. I can't explain this, but I just see a trend happening where looking 
[P70]  or quirky becomes a trend. Because the last few years, it's been trendy to all get the same procedures that make you look like a perfect Barbie doll. And I think the opposite is going to become trendy. So people who already have a gap in their teeth or already have a bunch of freckles or already have a mole on their lip or have a birthmark on their face, like these things are going to be really celebrated. And at times, 
[P71]  perhaps even manufactured. I think there's a chance that it'll become like a cosmetic procedure trend to like add quirks to your appearance. I don't know. I don't know if it's even possible. Like, could you go to a dentist and say like, I want to get a gap in my teeth like Madonna? Does she have a gap in her teeth? I think she does. Yeah. Like I want a Madonna gap in my teeth. Would the dentist do it? Probably. Um, I don't know. 
[P72]  that might be far-fetched, but I could kind of see it. Okay. Next 60s mod it's in. There's a lot of different little elements of the 1960s mod aesthetic that I think are going to come back. Some of them are going to be isolated. Like, okay. How do I explain this? Like, I don't think people are going to be like dressing up like a 1960s mod Halloween costume. Okay.

[P90]  example of what that looks like. But I could see a trend of people tying tape around their glasses, like around their reading glasses. I don't think suspenders are going to come back in. I could see, I can see this now when I close my eyes. Like imagine this outfit. This is to me is like a stereotypical sort of nerd outfit. Now, by the way, the word nerd, I don't know, like stereotyping people as nerds. 
[P91]  listen, I don't know if it's politically correct, but like everyone's a nerd in a little, in a sort of way. And by nerdy, I mean like dorky, which I think is charming. Like it's not, I'm not using the word nerd in any sort of derogatory way, but there is sort of like a stereotypical sort of nerd aesthetic, right? When I close my eyes and think about what version of nerd is going to come back in 2025, I think of the glasses with the tape wrapped around the center, you know, 
[P92]  nose bridge, right? Very stereotypical nerd. I think of a sweatshirt, maybe like just like a basic sweatshirt or a funny t-shirt that's like, maybe it doesn't fit particularly well. I think of maybe like a utilitarian pant of sorts, like a cargo pant, perhaps a cargo short, you know, things that are considered not necessarily fashionable or not necessarily 
[P93]  chic, right? Perhaps like a sort of narrow fitting shoe, like a small narrow fitting shoe, like a little sneaker that's sort of a bit nerdy, like almost like a little Merrill or like a little Keen or like a little like Adidas that's sort of narrow, like, I don't know, like a narrow, small sneaker. That's the kind of nerd that I'm imagining. And I think that that's going to be really in this year. 
[P94]  Almost like how everybody became obsessed with, like, Adam Sandler's street style. Because he would just wear, like, a dumpy pair of, like, basketball shorts and, like, an oversized T-shirt and, like, sneakers. And he just looked kind of like a mess. But everybody loved it. And I think that that's going to be back. Where it's, like, nerdy, like, computer lover vibes. Like, early 2000s nerd vibes. I see that coming back. Okay, next. Okay, hear me out. Clogs. 
[P95]  Clogs are so bad. I keep seeing people wearing clogs. Like I'm starting to see it happen. And I think 2025 is the year of the clog, which leads me to a broader prediction I have, which is sort of like gardening chef core. Okay. Now I'm not talking about cutesy little gardening, cutesy little chef. Like I actually weirdly imagine people taking inspiration from what chefs actually, 
[P96]  wear or like what you really wear gardening. You know what I'm saying? Like the utilitarian gardening gloves. OK, a utilitarian chef's waist apron. I could see these things becoming fashionable. And I think it's going to go hand in hand with, you know, gardening and cooking becoming trendy as an activity this year.

I think that's going to be in, but I don't think it's something we're ever going to look back at and cringe at, which is cool. It's cool when a trend also is timeless and it's rare. So I think this is one of the rare times when something timeless will be trendy. Moving on. Okay. So in 2024, the concept of 
[P17]  Jane Birkening your bag. Are we remembering this? This is the concept of taking your purse and attaching a bunch of personalized objects onto it, tying a bandana onto it, putting little charms on it, attaching jewelry to it, inspired by Jane Birken of the 60s, who carried around her iconic Birken bag that she attached a bunch of little accessories to that were personal to her. 
[P18]  and then gets a bit warm and then ties it around her purse to give her neck some air. That's the idea, right? Organically and authentically accessorizing her purse through necessity and convenience, weirdly enough, became a trend in 2024 where everybody was buying charms and finding bandanas and things in their drawers and then adding it to their bag to make it look authentic like Jane Birkin's bag. Fascinating trend. 
[P19]  think it's ending in 2025. I think it's going to expand in 2025. In 2024, it was all about the bag, right? Accessorizing the bag in that way. I think in 2025, it's about doing that with everything, okay? Your favorite hat, put a bunch of pins on it. Embroider a heart into it. Put a patch on it. On your jacket, there's a rip. You sew it with contrasting thread. Let's say it's a black jacket. You fix the 
[P20]  the rip with white thick thread, you know, you put pins on it, you put patches on it, your favorite pair of jeans, you put little accessories on the belt loops. You again, put patches, sew up the holes with bright thread, you know, paint your name onto the pocket, like accessorize, accessorize, accessorize with shoes, paint on your shoes. Like you get what I'm saying? Like making your pieces, 
[P21]  really, really unique to you. Because I think that what's going on right now is that a lot of people are craving a sense of personal style.

We're not wearing those jerseys anymore unless it's genuine. If you genuinely love a certain soccer team 
[P119]  them and whatever like that's different but there was a lot of people buying soccer jerseys and other sort of similar jerseys for the sake of fashion or stealing them from their little brothers give it back you know find somebody who you know who actually likes the team and give it to them just it's it's over uh and last but not least don't get mad at me for this designer dupes there's a big trend of buying designer dupes 
[P120]  last year, which I don't think is necessarily bad. If you really love something and you can find a dupe, I'm not going to judge you. You know, that's not, it's not about like moral righteousness. I'm not saying like designer dupes are out for 2025 because they're wrong. I am not the moral police here. Okay. I think it's out because I think people are going to choose to spend that money on something unique instead. Does that make sense? 
[P121]  Like instead of buying a dupe of something, why not take that money and buy something that just costs that much? You know, that's from like a cool, small little brand that you found online or at like a flea market or something. You know what I mean? I just think designer dupes are out because I think things that are explicitly designer are out. I think if you listen to my last episode about what I think is in and out for 2025, I talked a lot about how I think flexing and extravagance and showing off wealth. 
[P122]  all of this is out. And so I think as a result, you know, designer, like buying a designer dupe is out. Like, I just don't think people are going to be wasting their money on buying a dupe or something. Like, who cares? You know, like wearing designer things that are clearly designer aren't as, I think a bit of the excitement around that is gone. There are probably so many more trend predictions that I could come up with and so many things that I think are out, but that's all I have for right now. 
[P123]  have to cut myself off or else I'll talk for nine hours. And if I keep going, I'll also just list every single possible possibility, which also makes it less fun. It's like if I just, if I predict every single possible thing, like I think the 70s are going to be in and the 80s and the 90s and the 2000s. I think they're all going to be in. Then if I get one right, it doesn't matter because I actually listed every single possible thing that could ever possibly happen. So we're going to stop here. 
[P124]  you all for listening and hanging out. I hope that you enjoyed this episode. If I said something rude about something that you like, literally allow that to strengthen your love for that particular item, right? If I came on here and said, I hate camo, I did say that.

Indy sleeves fashion is characterized by mismatched, out of proportion, and chaotic pieces. Some examples include metallic leggings, tunics, knit beanies, fedoras, and chunky costume pearls. Okay, let's fucking relax on that. I'm not... That is not what I see coming back, but I see a version of Indy sleeves coming back. 
[P37]  That means in a minute because I don't agree on all of this. The fedora is like the fedora is insane. Like that is not coming back. Knee high socks are also a key part of the indie sleaze look, whatever. A tongue in cheek style that was influenced by Brooklyn hipster fashion, 70s, 80s, electro rock music, pop art, super flat pop, whatever, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? The style grew in popularity on sites like Tumblr and MySpace and was often seen as a counterculture reaction to the economic climate of the recession. Yeah. 
[P38]  I do think that this is happening again. It's obviously not going to be exactly the same as it was in 2006 to 2012, but I think there's going to be a lot of similarities in 2025. That's my prediction. Okay. I just said the gaunt makeup, the gaunt sort of like party girl gaunt makeup, very indie sleaze to take it a step further in makeup, smudgy black eye makeup. I could see that coming, 
[P39]  back, definitely black and white stripes. To me, black and white stripes, so indie sleeves to me and I fucking love it. And to me, black and white stripes are timeless, but I think they're really going to come back and I can't wait. I'm wearing black and white stripes right now. So yeah, ripped tights, DIY cut up shirts. Like that was very indie sleeves, like cutting the sleeves off and the neck off of your own shirt and it being all like saggy and like lopsided and weird looking. The 
[P40]  Union Jack, which is the United Kingdom's flag, you know, the red, white and blue sort of star looking Union Jack. That was super indie sleaze. I think that's going to come back. I do think certain more extreme indie sleaze details will come back, potentially like a metallic legging like Google provided for me. And last but not least, I do think skinny jeans are coming back. There's been so much discourse. I can't even stay away from the discourse around 
[P41]  skinny jeans. Everybody's debating, are the skinny jeans coming back this year? Are they not? To be honest, I haven't seen anyone really wearing skinny jeans, at least in my world or in my algorithm. Like the algorithm is not feeding me videos of people wearing skinny jeans. So I haven't seen it in action yet, but I do think this year skinny jeans are back as a part of Indie Sleaze vibes. But I don't think it's what we're all afraid of. I think we're all afraid of jeggings. That's what we're all really afraid of. 
[P42]  Skinny jeans themselves, yeah, they're not great. But I think what we're really all traumatized by is like low-waisted jeggings. That was skinny jeans at their worst form in, you know, the 2010s. That's not coming back, okay? So don't worry. We're not going to be spending 10 minutes getting our super skinny, low-waisted jeggings up our legs before work or school. Like that's never happening again, right?

[P111]  of style in 2025. Number one, every single niche in aesthetic and core that happened in 2024, every single one. We really, really had a quick trend cycle last year. And I think every single thing that we experimented with last year is just absolutely over this year. Every trend that popped up last year, we wore to death. 
[P112]  thing. Like very few things from last year that were big are going to make it to this year. I think most of them are going to die in 2024. Next, dressing exactly like another era on the nose. Okay. Almost like period dressing, not like period dressing, like, oh, I'm about to have my period. So I'm wearing black pants so that I don't stain my pants. I mean, like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I don't even know what the term for that would be, but you get the idea. Over the last few years, 
[P113]  There's been moments where it's been trendy to dress exactly like a certain era on the nose. OK, like Y2K on the nose. That was really trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 90s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing really 70s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 80s on the nose. This is all within the last five years. OK, at any point in time over the last five years, 
[P114]  there's been a trend of dressing like a certain era, whether it's Y2K or 90s or 80s or 70s or 60s. Actually, not really 60s as much, but do you get what I'm saying? Like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I think that that's out completely. And I know that I mentioned 90s minimalism and I know that I mentioned 60s mod as being in, but I more mean elements from those time periods. I don't mean like dressing exactly 
[P115]  like that time period. I think that dressing exactly like a certain time period, it always sort of feels costume-esque, which is not timeless. Mixing and matching various references from various decades and making something kind of new and kind of your own, I think that's probably better. And I think that that's going to be what people are doing in 2025. I think it's going to look costumey to 
[P116]  dress exactly Y2K, exactly 90s, exactly 70s. You know what I mean? Even exactly 60s mod, even though I think a lot of elements of the 60s mod are going to be in. I think if you dress up like you're somebody in the 60s mod era, it's going to look costumey. And I think that that's not going to fly in 2025. Next camo. Camo is so done. It's done. Unless you're literally like a deer hunter, 
[P117]  or you're in the army. Like, no, if you're just, if you're like, like a little fashion kid in New York wearing the camo, I think that might be out. I think that might be out. I think that pattern is out. I'm sorry. I never loved it, which is, by the way, if you love camo, I'm not even kidding. If you love camo still, by all means, wear camo. Okay. It's none of my business, but I think it's out. It got really big in 2024. And I think,

[P28]  money, whatever. And it's impossible to have any sort of attachment or appreciation for the pieces that you have when you have more than you could ever wear. Do you know what I'm saying? So I think we're going to swing in the opposite direction and it'll become cool to be seen in your iconic pair of jeans that everybody knows are your jeans. Does that make sense? Like it'll be cooler to repeat stuff. I don't know. We'll see. That might be a pipe dream. 
[P29]  Okay, next. Gaunt makeup. By gaunt makeup, I mean no blush, no highlighter, no faux freckles. I'm talking about sharp contour, otherwise sort of even complexion, right? Like you're not adding blush. You're not adding freckles. You're not adding all this stuff. Other than that, it's just like sort of flat, not dewy, but also not matte sort of face with contour. 
[P30]  Cool tones, neutral tones, but mainly cool tones. Kind of gaunt makeup. This to me is very like 90s minimalist as well. It kind of goes hand in hand with that vibe. But it also goes hand in hand with another one of my predictions. I feel like the makeup trend for the past few years has been really sweet, really warm, really youthful, really bright, 
[P31]  happy. And I think there's going to be a shift to more of a grungier sort of darker sort of look. And, you know, I'm actually not mad about this because I've been doing my makeup like this when I do my own makeup anyway for quite a while now, mainly because I think it emphasizes my personal features the best. Like, I don't think I look good when I have a lot of blush on or when I have, you know, like highlighter on my 
[P32]  little nose and in the little corners of my eye, in the little inner corner of my eye. Like, I just don't really look good like that. In my opinion, like I look better, in my opinion, with more like Tim Burton-y kind of makeup. I like that. I mean, I also like the Tim Burton movies and I grew up watching them and loving them. And it's more of like a sort of creepy sort of vibe. And I've always loved that. So, and I feel like, you know, I have the dark circles under my eyes and I have sort of big eyes. 
[P33]  kind of maybe I wish like a Tim Burton character. I can only dream that I look like a Tim Burton character, but it's like, so I like to make myself look even more like a Tim Burton character by like not covering my dark circles with concealer, by just doing like light face makeup that just exactly matches my skin tone and is like not even noticeable. It just makes it look like I just have more even complexion than I do. Contouring the face, cool toned neutrals on the eyes, 
[P34]  mascara, and then like a deep pinky brown overlined lip. And it makes my eyes look like big and scary and the dark circle looks dark. And I like it. I just, I like it. I don't know why, but I actually think it's going to be in. And I could be wrong. Cause I mean, I've been doing it for a few years now, maybe like two or three, perhaps. I don't remember. Maybe like two years now, but I think it's going to be in. And that actually leads us to indie sleaze, which is also already, 
[P35]  in, but will be even more so in, in like a big way. Indie sleaze really started to come back in 2024, but I think in 2025, it's going to reach its peak because it definitely hasn't reached its peak yet. It definitely hasn't. Let's Google what indie sleaze is so that we can all be up to date. Okay. Indie sleaze is a term that describes a style of music and fashion that was popular

I Googled it for you, and I have the definition right here. Minimalism is a style that prioritizes simplicity, clean lines, neutral colors, and timeless silhouettes, focusing on quality over quantity and emphasizing essential, versatile pieces rather than trendy,

[P54]  I think is going to be in. We'll see. Next, asymmetrical stuff. This is something I'm predicting because I've been seeing it pop up more and more on Pinterest. And I actually have a few asymmetrical pieces in my closet that I've collected over the years. So it definitely has been in already for the last few years, but I think it's going to be mainstream this year. I think it's going to be huge. Like everything's going to be asymmetrical. And by asymmetrical, 
[P55]  I mean, like, let's say you have a little sweater. Instead of the buttons going down the middle, the buttons are going down the left side of the sweater. Or even weird shit, like a shirt where one sleeve is long and one sleeve is short. Or a skirt where, like, the left side of the skirt is long and the right side of the skirt is, like, a foot shorter. Or a seam that goes down a weird part of the shirt. Or, like, do you see what I'm saying? Asymmetrical stuff. 
[P56]  asymmetry is going to be in. I think to take it a step further, minimalist design that is asymmetrical. So like a classic white button down, but the buttons are like on the left side. Do you see what I'm saying? That is going to be so in. Taking like minimalist design and then really just making it asymmetrical. Oh man, people are going to love that. Okay, next. Buttons are the new bows. Yeah, I think that. And I'm frightened. 
[P57]  I'm frightened because I love buttons. To me, buttons are timeless, but I think that they're going to be used as a textural element instead of as a functional element, right? Like buttons are technically used on a garment as sort of a closure mechanism, right? Buttons are used to close the garment, right? I think buttons are going to become trendy to the point where there's buttons everywhere on shit. Buttons don't even need to be there. 
[P58]  a purpose where they are. And can I be honest? I love this. And I think it's timeless. And I think it might become trendy, but I don't even care because I'm going to love that for the rest of my life. I hope it becomes trendy because then I'm going to buy up all the cool stuff. No, I'm not. I'm trying to not have a shopping addiction this year or ever again for the rest of my life. So I will not buy it up. Maybe I'll buy one special button item. But I am 
[P59]  a button tattooed on my arm. So I'm worried that it's going to become trendy to put buttons on everything and then everyone's going to start to hate buttons. And then my tattoo of a button is going to look cringe and basic. Not that there's anything wrong with being basic, but I have a button tattoo on my arm because my favorite movie is Coraline and the button is one of the main symbols of the movie. And so that's why I have a button on my arm. 
[P60]  And that's why I love buttons so much. Also, just because they're freaking cute. They're so cute. Anyway, the reason why I think buttons are the new bows, though, is because similar to a bow, like bows are absolutely timeless. A bow is a bow. It's too crucial of a design element to not be timeless. Like bows will always exist. Bows will always be in. You know what I mean?

输入内容：
[P120]  last year, which I don't think is necessarily bad. If you really love something and you can find a dupe, I'm not going to judge you. You know, that's not, it's not about like moral righteousness. I'm not saying like designer dupes are out for 2025 because they're wrong. I am not the moral police here. Okay. I think it's out because I think people are going to choose to spend that money on something unique instead. Does that make sense? 
[P121]  Like instead of buying a dupe of something, why not take that money and buy something that just costs that much? You know, that's from like a cool, small little brand that you found online or at like a flea market or something. You know what I mean? I just think designer dupes are out because I think things that are explicitly designer are out. I think if you listen to my last episode about what I think is in and out for 2025, I talked a lot about how I think flexing and extravagance and showing off wealth. 
[P122]  all of this is out. And so I think as a result, you know, designer, like buying a designer dupe is out. Like, I just don't think people are going to be wasting their money on buying a dupe or something. Like, who cares? You know, like wearing designer things that are clearly designer aren't as, I think a bit of the excitement around that is gone. There are probably so many more trend predictions that I could come up with and so many things that I think are out, but that's all I have for right now. 
[P123]  have to cut myself off or else I'll talk for nine hours. And if I keep going, I'll also just list every single possible possibility, which also makes it less fun. It's like if I just, if I predict every single possible thing, like I think the 70s are going to be in and the 80s and the 90s and the 2000s. I think they're all going to be in. Then if I get one right, it doesn't matter because I actually listed every single possible thing that could ever possibly happen. So we're going to stop here. 
[P124]  you all for listening and hanging out. I hope that you enjoyed this episode. If I said something rude about something that you like, literally allow that to strengthen your love for that particular item, right? If I came on here and said, I hate camo, I did say that. If me saying I hate camo upsets you because you love camo, allow that to further strengthen your love for camo. Say, 
[P125]  know what? When Emma said she hated camo, it made me so mad because I love camo and Emma doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about. Great. Great. Wear whatever the fuck you want. Pay attention to the trend cycles. Ignore the trend cycles. Do whatever you want to do. Okay. Fashion is about you. Use fashion as a tool that benefits you. And it's not that deep. I love talking about it though. Oh my God. I love talking about fashion, but it's not that deep, but we'll see what happens. We'll see if I get anything 
[P126]  right. I really, really think the yellow raincoat, I keep almost calling it a rain coot. It's very weird. Uh, I really do think that the yellow raincoat and the yellow rain boots are going to come back that I have the same feeling about that, that I had about the boat shoes. Like it was almost like, uh, it was like God came down and told me. So we'll see. Anywho, that's all I have to say. Thank you all for listening and hanging out. It's always a pleasure. If you enjoyed it, come back.

[P1] ﻿ About a year ago, I predicted the boat shoe trend. Yeah, I did. And can I be honest? Since then, I've been chasing that feeling. The feeling of predicting a trend and then seeing it in the real world, I imagine rivals the feeling of seeing your newborn baby for the first time. Like, I think I'll probably feel that excited again on the day that I give birth to my first child. That's the next time I'll feel that level of satisfaction, unless, 
[P2]  I'm able to successfully predict another trend before that, which is what I'm going to try to do today. Today, I am going to share with you my 2025 fashion trend predictions. If I can get even one of these right, I'll be able to match that feeling I got when I predicted the boat shoe coming back. But I'm being realistic here. I don't have a crystal ball. Some of these predictions are random gut feelings. 
[P3]  are based on what I've studied sort of starting to become popular over the past few years, but haven't fully gone mainstream yet. And I predict that this year they will go mainstream. So it's a combination of gut feelings and educated guesses. The educated guesses are less satisfying if they come true because it's like I saw it coming in the world, right? The gut feelings, those, if they come true, 
[P4]  more rewarding. So hopefully, well, whatever. I'll just be happy if I get anything right. So let's begin. 2025 fashion trend predictions. I briefly paused this episode of Anything Goes to let you know that this episode of Anything Goes is presented by Amazon. Getting sick is horrible enough. The getting better part shouldn't be horrible too. Waiting on hold for an appointment, sitting in crowded waiting rooms,

[P30]  Cool tones, neutral tones, but mainly cool tones. Kind of gaunt makeup. This to me is very like 90s minimalist as well. It kind of goes hand in hand with that vibe. But it also goes hand in hand with another one of my predictions. I feel like the makeup trend for the past few years has been really sweet, really warm, really youthful, really bright, 
[P31]  happy. And I think there's going to be a shift to more of a grungier sort of darker sort of look. And, you know, I'm actually not mad about this because I've been doing my makeup like this when I do my own makeup anyway for quite a while now, mainly because I think it emphasizes my personal features the best.

[P33]  kind of maybe I wish like a Tim Burton character. I can only dream that I look like a Tim Burton character, but it's like, so I like to make myself look even more like a Tim Burton character by like not covering my dark circles with concealer, by just doing like light face makeup that just exactly matches my skin tone and is like not even noticeable.

主题：Indie Sleaze风格的复兴

输入内容：
[P47]  I don't know. We'll have to see. It might not happen, but I definitely could see the skinny jean coming back. Anyway, Indie Sleaze, I think it's back this year. It already started in 2024, so I'm not some sort of genius for predicting that, but I think it's going to hit its peak this year. Okay, next. Micro glitter matte lipstick. Okay, close your eyes and think about the early 2000s and think about the makeup trends and think about the lipstick that the beloved women in your life were wearing. 
[P48]  shimmery. It was light pink. It was micro glitters. It was like almost holographic. I think that that's coming back. You know, I was thinking about the makeup that my mom wore when I was a kid randomly the other day, like completely randomly, like I was daydreaming and that just popped into my head. And I was like, that lipstick is definitely going to come back. I just had this gut feeling. And then like a week or two later, I was watching 
[P49]  the first episode of Sex and the City for the first time, actually, because I've never watched that show. My friends were watching the first episode of Sex and the City, and I noticed that the main character was wearing that type of lipstick. And I was like, whoa, there it is again. I totally see it. Micro glitter, shimmer, matte lipstick, early 2000s lipstick vibe. Just, I don't know. I see it coming back. I see it coming back. Okay, next. 
[P50]  random. This is literally so random. Polka dots. Yeah. Polka dots. Listen, you'll notice that I'm saying a lot of timeless, classic, obvious patterns. Stripes I mentioned earlier. Polka dots I'm mentioning now. I'm going to mention stripes probably one or two more times because I think stripes are really going to be in this year. I know what you're thinking. Emma, these are the most obvious, timeless patterns. I know. But I think that that's 
[P51]  why they're going to be in this year. I think we all have such trend fatigue from keeping up with trends for the past few years. We're so exhausted with the speed of trend cycles. I think a lot of people are going to be making timeless choices this year, almost out of necessity. Like, oh my God, what can I buy that I can wear for more than six months without getting bored of it? You know? And so I think classic patterns like stripes and polka dots are going to be in. But specifically, 
[P52]  we're talking about polka dots right now. I actually, I usually get red nails when I go to the nail salon. I just always get red nails. But the last time I was there, I got little polka dots because I really do believe that polka dots are going to be stylish again. I think that they're always stylish, but I think it's going to be one of those patterns that we're not going to be able to get away from. Luckily, I think if you buy something polka dot now, you'll be able to wear it forever. 
[P53]  Because I do think that polka dots are very timeless. But I do think we might get a little bit bored of polka dots by the end of this year. I could see that happening. If they do fully come back to the extent that I think that they will. But I personally love polka dots. Like I'm actually really excited. And I don't know. I think like polka dot tights, polka dot, like a black and white polka dot jacket, like trench coat, little pops of polka dots here and there.

[P84]  analog clock. Everyone under the age of 40 prefers a digital watch, prefers a digital clock in general. None of us know how to read a clock under the age of 40. None of us. And if we do, it takes us at least five minutes to read the fucking clock. 5, 10, 15, 20. Oh, wait, what's the longhand do? It's not good. Digital watches are fucking back. You know, it was all about having like a chic wrist stack, 
[P85]  with like a beautiful Cartier watch or like a beautiful Rolex or whatever, or like a beautiful metal watch. You know, that was very trendy for a while there. Don't get me wrong. I actually do think that a lot of times those pieces of jewelry are timeless, but I think it's going to become cool to wear like a plastic Casio digital watch. In fact, I've been wearing one for the past few months, inspired by someone in my life who does wear a digital watch. Okay. 
[P86]  story, actually. This came from somebody in my life who wears a digital watch. They're the only person I know who wears a digital watch. And I remember the first day I met this person, I saw them and they were wearing a digital watch. And I remember looking at it and thinking to myself, what the fuck is going on? They're wearing a big plastic digital watch. And I was like, I have not seen somebody wear a digital watch like this who's under the age of 60. Like in, 
[P87]  Maybe ever. Like, I'm shocked by this. And as I got to know this person, I was like, hold on a minute. They're a fucking genius, to be honest. The digital watch is weatherproof. I mean, you can wear the digital, like, plasticky sort of watch anywhere. In the shower, to your workout. And a lot of times they're cheaper than the metal watches, so you're not worried about them. But more importantly, it's actually a readable watch. 
[P88]  the digital, like I just look at my wrist now that I've been wearing this rubber digital watch for the last like six months. I just look at my wrist and I know exactly what time it is. And there's no, there's no stress. And I actually think it looks cool. I did not think it looked cool at first when I saw this person wearing their digital watch the first time I met them. I, to be honest, I was like, I don't like it. I don't like that watch. What is that watch? Take that thing off. And then it grew on me and I was like, no, I actually think it's really, it's really genius. 
[P89]  myself I could see the digital watch coming back in which takes me to my next trend prediction nerd vibes remember in the 2010s when like it was all about nerds like everybody wanted to wear like suspenders and like glasses that had the white tape around the center like nerdcore I could see that coming back in in 2025 and I think the digital watch is like a great example 
[P90]  example of what that looks like. But I could see a trend of people tying tape around their glasses, like around their reading glasses. I don't think suspenders are going to come back in. I could see, I can see this now when I close my eyes. Like imagine this outfit. This is to me is like a stereotypical sort of nerd outfit. Now, by the way, the word nerd, I don't know, like stereotyping people as nerds.

[P61]  will be. But I think the same thing that happened with bows will happen with buttons where we put bows on everything, right? Everybody was tying ribbon around everything. Everybody was, you know, attaching little bows to everything. Brands were coming out with stuff that just had bows all over it. There's just so many bows. It was like, oh my God, we need to stop with the bows. They're not serving a purpose. They're just here and it's stale. It became stale very quickly. 
[P62]  same thing will happen with buttons where it's like, you know, a button doing its normal button function, closing a garment will always be cool. That's timeless. But buttons being in a place just for the sake of buttons, I think might not be as timeless for majority of people. And I think majority of people will get sick of buttons in that way. Except for me, because I love buttons so much and have such a personal connection to buttons. 
[P63]  And it will never be wrong. To me, a button is never wrong. Next. So this is not necessarily like a fashion trend in the sense of like clothing or makeup or whatever. This is more of like a physical human body trend, which listen, I'm not saying that we should have body related trends. Okay. I don't think, I don't think that that's great. Right.

[P77]  I don't know, like if they see other women doing it, they'll feel invited to do it themselves too. Because it's really scary to go and get a pixie haircut when it's not trending. I'll tell you, it's really scary because it's a risky haircut. But if other people start doing it, I think it's going to become, I don't know, it's like a domino effect. The more people that have a pixie haircut, the more people that will feel empowered to do it themselves. And it's so cool to me and it's so comfortable and fun to style. 
[P78]  I don't know. I just think the pixie's great and I think it's going to come back. Another 1960s mod vibe, color blocking. A technique that involves wearing multiple solid colored clothing items in an outfit, often in complimentary colors. This sort of goes hand in hand with the idea of minimalist design, sort of white t-shirt, black pant, black sweater with the white, you know what I mean? Like very simple color blocking, easy on the eyes. Those two things go hand in hand in my mind. 
[P79]  I think this sort of simplicity is going to be really appealing this year, especially because I think the concept of having a lot of simple pieces and building more intricate outfits using a bunch of simple pieces is going to be really in this year because it's a more sustainable way to play with fashion, whereas constantly shopping and buying new unique pieces and making outfits with them once or twice and then donating them. Like, I just think people are going to get sick of that. 
[P80]  cadence of buying and donating and buying and donating and dealing with clutter and stuff like that. So I think the concept of color blocking is going to work really well. You know, you can wear a green t-shirt with a pair of blue pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of brown pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of orange pants. And you know what I mean? And it's, it's always, it's going to bring a different feeling every single time because it's a different combination of clothes, but that was all just with one shirt. 
[P81]  You put a little vest over that shirt. Now it feels different. It's like, I think layering and color blocking is going to be in, which is definitely very 1960s mod. Also classic patterns, stripes, polka dots, plaids, like simple timeless patterns that are always in. Very 60s mod. I think that'll be in. Simple minimalist designs are very 1960s mod. 
[P82]  just classic silhouettes that we all know and love, especially with like little skirts and dresses, timeless. And you can't go wrong. I started seeing 60s mod silhouettes on the runway like last year. And I was like, oh man, that's really going to come back in a big way. And it hasn't fully come back yet, but I think this is the year that it will. And last but not least, more modest silhouettes. I feel like the 1960s, 
[P83]  2020's aesthetic was very classy, very modest. And I could see that coming back, weirdly enough. Like a longer skirt, a boxier fit, not skin tight. I think that's going to be in. Yeah. Okay, moving on from 1960s mod, the digital watch. The digital watch.

[P41]  skinny jeans. Everybody's debating, are the skinny jeans coming back this year? Are they not? To be honest, I haven't seen anyone really wearing skinny jeans, at least in my world or in my algorithm. Like the algorithm is not feeding me videos of people wearing skinny jeans. So I haven't seen it in action yet, but I do think this year skinny jeans are back as a part of Indie Sleaze vibes. But I don't think it's what we're all afraid of. I think we're all afraid of jeggings. That's what we're all really afraid of. 
[P42]  Skinny jeans themselves, yeah, they're not great. But I think what we're really all traumatized by is like low-waisted jeggings. That was skinny jeans at their worst form in, you know, the 2010s. That's not coming back, okay? So don't worry. We're not going to be spending 10 minutes getting our super skinny, low-waisted jeggings up our legs before work or school. Like that's never happening again, right? 
[P43]  but I do think skinny jeans are going to come back. But I think that they're actually going to be less hideous than we imagine. In fact, when I think about styling skinny jeans, I'm not repulsed, which is really frightening. Because a few years ago, if you would have asked me if skinny jeans would ever come back, I would have said maybe, but like, I will never, like, I can't even imagine it. Like, it's going to be hideous. I could see it being cool. I could see it being cool. I'm definitely thinking outside the box, 
[P44]  when I'm thinking of skinny jeans looking cool, but it's not impossible. It's not impossible. And I think it will be done this year. Am I going to participate? Probably not. Although never say never, because I might get inspired and really want to do it. And I might pick up a pair, but I doubt it. And I'm going to wait as long as possible until I'm exploding and bursting at the seams and need to wear skinny jeans, which I don't think will happen. But again, never say never. I think a very specific type of skinny jean is going to come back. Real denim, like stiff, 
[P45]  real denim that's not so skin tight to the leg that it like takes two hours to get up like reasonably tight but not like impossibly tight like what was popular in the 2010s I think timeless washes right like classic denim washes nothing that's like acid wash super ripped and distressed none of that black denim I think will be fine but like 
[P46]  No extreme denim washes. And I think it might, I think it might work. I think it might work. The only thing I'm struggling with is like what shoe perhaps tucked into a boot. Oh my God. Like a skinny jean tucked into like a moto boot. Oh my God. I'm scared. Is that going to happen? Or like a skinny jean with like a little ballet flat or like a little flat shoe of some sort. Ooh, it might happen. I don't know. I could see people talking little skinny jeans into boots. I could definitely see that.

This isn't a coincidence that a lot of these things are really classic. A yellow raincoat and yellow rain boot, it doesn't get more classic than that. Not only does it fall under the sort of nautical category, which I think is coming back anyway, but it's also timeless. I'm super into it. This is actually one of the few things that I personally will 
[P103]  be buying if I see a version of it that appeals to me because it really excites me. And if this prediction is true or even if it's not, I'm probably going to get my hands on it anyway because I really want a yellow pair of rain boots and I really want a yellow raincoat. It just is cute and I just want it. But jumping off of that, I think perhaps a pop of yellow could be the new pop of red. Last year, it was all about the pop of red. I could see a pop of yellow becoming the new pop of red. That's just a brief side note. It doesn't really have anything to do 
[P104]  with nautical, but I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Back to nautical. Blue and white stripes. Okay. I think stripes are going to be all the rage. I think they're going to be all the rage in a bazillion different ways. Like the black and white stripe, indie sleaze. Blue and white stripe, nautical aesthetic. Okay. Red and white stripe, nautical aesthetic. I think a nautical stripe is going to be really in, which I absolutely love. 
[P105]  classic cable knit sweaters, like thick, chunky, high quality looking, simple, one color, neutral colors, cable knit sweater, like a cream cable knit sweater, a blue cable knit sweater, not neon, not bright, muted, muted colors, muted colors, cable knit sweater, very fisherman looking, very vintage looking, but not vintage in like an eighties way. No, 
[P106]  Oh, classic, classic, simple, neutral cable knit sweater. Thick knit, thick, thick yarn. Not thin, not flimsy, thick, boxy, fisherman cable knit sweater. Little fisherman's hats, okay? Like a little tight little beanie or like a little tight little cap that has no bill at the front. Like it's just a little fisherman's cap, a little, do you know what those are? Like a little cap? Cap?

Honestly, if this becomes trendy and brands start making yellow raincoats and yellow rain boots, I will be buying a pair of each because I'm really into this trend.

输入内容：
[P114]  there's been a trend of dressing like a certain era, whether it's Y2K or 90s or 80s or 70s or 60s. Actually, not really 60s as much, but do you get what I'm saying? Like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I think that that's out completely. And I know that I mentioned 90s minimalism and I know that I mentioned 60s mod as being in, but I more mean elements from those time periods. I don't mean like dressing exactly 
[P115]  like that time period. I think that dressing exactly like a certain time period, it always sort of feels costume-esque, which is not timeless. Mixing and matching various references from various decades and making something kind of new and kind of your own, I think that's probably better. And I think that that's going to be what people are doing in 2025. I think it's going to look costumey to 
[P116]  dress exactly Y2K, exactly 90s, exactly 70s. You know what I mean? Even exactly 60s mod, even though I think a lot of elements of the 60s mod are going to be in. I think if you dress up like you're somebody in the 60s mod era, it's going to look costumey. And I think that that's not going to fly in 2025. Next camo. Camo is so done. It's done. Unless you're literally like a deer hunter, 
[P117]  or you're in the army. Like, no, if you're just, if you're like, like a little fashion kid in New York wearing the camo, I think that might be out. I think that might be out. I think that pattern is out. I'm sorry. I never loved it, which is, by the way, if you love camo, I'm not even kidding. If you love camo still, by all means, wear camo. Okay. It's none of my business, but I think it's out. It got really big in 2024. And I think, 
[P118]  It's going to be out. Next, the whole soccer jersey trend, like it was such a trend to wear like international soccer jerseys. That is out. Everybody give your Argentinian soccer jersey for a team that you don't know back to your little brother who actually cares about the team. Do you know what I'm saying? Like it's done. We're not wearing those jerseys anymore unless it's genuine. If you genuinely love a certain soccer team 
[P119]  them and whatever like that's different but there was a lot of people buying soccer jerseys and other sort of similar jerseys for the sake of fashion or stealing them from their little brothers give it back you know find somebody who you know who actually likes the team and give it to them just it's it's over uh and last but not least don't get mad at me for this designer dupes there's a big trend of buying designer dupes

[P34]  mascara, and then like a deep pinky brown overlined lip. And it makes my eyes look like big and scary and the dark circle looks dark. And I like it. I just, I like it. I don't know why, but I actually think it's going to be in. And I could be wrong. Cause I mean, I've been doing it for a few years now, maybe like two or three, perhaps. I don't remember. Maybe like two years now, but I think it's going to be in. And that actually leads us to indie sleaze, which is also already, 
[P35]  in, but will be even more so in, in like a big way. Indie sleaze really started to come back in 2024, but I think in 2025, it's going to reach its peak because it definitely hasn't reached its peak yet. It definitely hasn't. Let's Google what indie sleaze is so that we can all be up to date. Okay. Indie sleaze is a term that describes a style of music and fashion that was popular 
[P36]  in the United States and UK from around 2006 to 2012. The fashion was an affordable, messy, and lethargic take on vintage styles, especially from the 70s. Indy sleeves fashion is characterized by mismatched, out of proportion, and chaotic pieces. Some examples include metallic leggings, tunics, knit beanies, fedoras, and chunky costume pearls. Okay, let's fucking relax on that. I'm not... That is not what I see coming back, but I see a version of Indy sleeves coming back. 
[P37]  That means in a minute because I don't agree on all of this. The fedora is like the fedora is insane. Like that is not coming back. Knee high socks are also a key part of the indie sleaze look, whatever. A tongue in cheek style that was influenced by Brooklyn hipster fashion, 70s, 80s, electro rock music, pop art, super flat pop, whatever, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? The style grew in popularity on sites like Tumblr and MySpace and was often seen as a counterculture reaction to the economic climate of the recession. Yeah. 
[P38]  I do think that this is happening again. It's obviously not going to be exactly the same as it was in 2006 to 2012, but I think there's going to be a lot of similarities in 2025. That's my prediction. Okay. I just said the gaunt makeup, the gaunt sort of like party girl gaunt makeup, very indie sleaze to take it a step further in makeup, smudgy black eye makeup. I could see that coming, 
[P39]  back, definitely black and white stripes. To me, black and white stripes, so indie sleeves to me and I fucking love it. And to me, black and white stripes are timeless, but I think they're really going to come back and I can't wait. I'm wearing black and white stripes right now. So yeah, ripped tights, DIY cut up shirts. Like that was very indie sleeves, like cutting the sleeves off and the neck off of your own shirt and it being all like saggy and like lopsided and weird looking. The 
[P40]  Union Jack, which is the United Kingdom's flag, you know, the red, white and blue sort of star looking Union Jack. That was super indie sleaze. I think that's going to come back. I do think certain more extreme indie sleaze details will come back, potentially like a metallic legging like Google provided for me. And last but not least, I do think skinny jeans are coming back. There's been so much discourse. I can't even stay away from the discourse around

[P8]  and neutral colors and timeless silhouettes. So, you know, when I say that minimalism is coming back, what comes to my mind is like 90s minimalism. Let's Google 90s minimalism. Okay, if you Google 90s minimalism, this is what comes up. I'm looking on British Vogue at an article called The Minimalist 90s Outfits Inspiring My Summer Wardrobe, just to give some examples of some minimalist outfits. 
[P9]  I see a plain white t-shirt with some simple pinstripe dress pants and a matching pinstripe dressy little vest. I see classic blue jeans. I see classic black boots. A lot of simple tank tops, t-shirts in neutral colors. Lots of black and white button down shirts. 
[P10]  simple dress pants or capris, classic just suit jackets, blazers, simple dresses that aren't super tight in neutral colors, lots of black boots, lots of plain, simple, flat loafers, black, white, brown. I mean, yeah, it's just, it's like, it's very, it's simple, but it does still have swag. And the swag element is what's really 
[P11]  really hard to put a finger on. Somehow 90s minimalism, when you Google it, it doesn't look boring. There's magic happening with it somehow. I don't know. I see 90s minimalism really being the main trend this year. And here's the thing. The truth of the matter is minimalism in clothing design is timeless. Like a white button down, a pair of blue jeans, a pair of black slacks, a pair of little simple black loafers, a black boot. 
[P12]  a white t-shirt. These things are never out. They are always in. So a lot of people I've seen online saying like, minimalism is just another trend. It's not preventing people from buying more stuff. People are going to buy minimalist design. And then when that's out, they're going to go and they're going to buy maximalist design again. Minimalist stuff is just as trendy as maximalist stuff. I actually disagree. There's kind of a debate happening on the internet around 
[P13]  whether or not minimalist designs are timeless, whether or not they come in and out of style. I definitely do think they have trendy moments, but I think unlike maximalist designs, they're always in and no one can change my mind. Okay. I think minimalist design is really going to be in, in 2025, but it's never going to be out because it's too simple to ever be in or out. You know what I'm saying? If you were doing sort of the clean girl aesthetic, 
[P14]  2024, 2023, 2024, which consisted of, you know, the slick back bun, the trench coats, the dress pants, the little loafers, the little button up shirts. It's just very like chic and classy. Literally, just by styling that slightly different, maybe doing your hair a little bit different, maybe accessorizing a little bit differently, you now have 90s minimalism, right? And then in a few years when there's a new sort of minimalist style that's in, you can, 
[P15]  reuse those pieces again. I just, I really do think when it comes to trends, any sort of minimalist trend to me is the safest one to buy into because you actually can reuse those pieces in a million different ways. So I think investing in good minimalist pieces, I would be shocked if you regretted it, you know, unless you're just a maximalist at heart and you don't like clothes like that. Fair enough.

[P23]  be wearing a new outfit. That was sort of trendy, right? For many years to always be wearing a new outfit, to never wear the same outfit twice. I think that that's out. And I think having signature pieces that are super personalized that you wear over and over and over again and you style a multitude of ways, I think that's in. I even thought about it in terms of the Stanley Cup, which is not really a fashionable thing. That's more of like a pop culture obsession. 
[P24]  a Stanley Cup. I have a Stanley Cup. But I even thought about it like this. Like, this is almost a metaphor for what I mean for fashion in like clothing and stuff. It's the idea of like, instead of having every single color of Stanley Cup, instead of having the bright pink one and the blue one and the sparkly white one and the brown one and the orange one and the green one, you just have one that's your favorite color and you put stickers on it. You take your watch 
[P25]  the middle of the day and you attach it to your Stanley cup and you, it's like truly a utilitarian, like fully functional item. And it is your personal favorite item. It becomes a special thing to you. If you only have one and the one that you do have, you use every day or very consistently. And it looks like you, it becomes your iconic Stanley cup. That I think is going to be cool. That's going to be the way that we 
[P26]  consume, I think, in 2025. Instead of having nine pairs of jeans, you have two and they're both really special. And they're known as like, oh, those are Emma's jeans. Like if somebody were to see your signature pair of jeans on a mannequin in a store, they'd be like, wait, those are what? Those are Emma's jeans. You see what I'm saying here? 
[P27]  re-wear over and over and over again. I honestly love this idea and hope that it ends up happening because I think something that a lot of us are missing, especially those of us who love fashion and love to participate in fashion, is a sort of attachment to our belongings, our clothing, our accessories. Nowadays, it's about buying more by whatever means necessary, thrifting, buying online for really cheap, 
[P28]  money, whatever. And it's impossible to have any sort of attachment or appreciation for the pieces that you have when you have more than you could ever wear. Do you know what I'm saying? So I think we're going to swing in the opposite direction and it'll become cool to be seen in your iconic pair of jeans that everybody knows are your jeans. Does that make sense? Like it'll be cooler to repeat stuff. I don't know. We'll see. That might be a pipe dream. 

分析结果：
### 主题与核心观点
- **主要论述的主题**：时尚消费趋势的变化，特别是从“不断购买新衣物”转向“拥有个性化、标志性的单品并重复穿着”。
- **核心观点和立场**：作者认为，未来的时尚趋势将不再追求“每天穿新衣服”，而是更注重拥有个性化、标志性的单品，并通过重复穿着和个性化装饰来赋予这些单品独特的意义。这种趋势将带来对物品的更深层次的情感依恋和认同感。

---

### 论据与事实
- **重要的论据**：
  - 作者以Stanley Cup（斯坦利杯）为例，说明个性化物品的价值。通过选择自己喜欢的颜色并贴上贴纸，Stanley Cup从普通物品变成了个人标志性物品。
  - 作者提到未来的消费趋势将是从拥有多件相似物品（如九条牛仔裤）转向拥有少量但特别且个性化的物品（如两条标志性牛仔裤）。
- **关键的事实依据**：
  - 当前时尚消费趋势是“买更多”，通过二手购物、网购等方式获取大量廉价衣物，导致人们对衣物缺乏情感依恋。
  - 作者预测，未来人们会更倾向于重复穿着标志性单品，并认为这种趋势将在2025年成为主流。
- **数据支撑**：无具体数据，但通过Stanley Cup和牛仔裤的例子进行类比说明。

---

### 关键信息
- **重要的概念**：
  - **标志性单品**：个性化、重复穿着的衣物或物品，成为个人风格的象征。
  - **情感依恋**：对物品的深层次情感联系，而非仅仅将其视为消费品。
- **关键的时间点**：2025年，作者预测这种消费趋势将成为主流。
- **重要的数据**：无具体数据。

---

### 逻辑结构
- **论述的逻辑关系**：
  - 作者首先指出过去“每天穿新衣服”的趋势已经过时，并提出未来趋势是拥有个性化、标志性单品。
  - 通过Stanley Cup的例子，说明个性化物品的价值和意义。
  - 进一步以牛仔裤为例，说明未来消费趋势将是从“多”到“少”，从“普通”到“特别”。
  - 最后，作者总结当前消费模式的问题（缺乏情感依恋），并预测未来趋势将转向重复穿着标志性单品。
- **因果关联**：
  - 当前消费模式（买更多）导致人们对衣物缺乏情感依恋。
  - 未来趋势（拥有少量标志性单品）将带来更深层次的情感联系和认同感。
- **推理过程**：
  - 通过类比和举例，作者从具体物品（Stanley Cup、牛仔裤）推导出未来时尚消费趋势的变化。

> **原文引用**：
> - "Instead of having nine pairs of jeans, you have two and they're both really special. And they're known as like, oh, those are Emma's jeans."（P26）

> - "Nowadays, it's about buying more by whatever means necessary, thrifting, buying online for really cheap, money, whatever."（P27）
>   - **中文翻译**：如今，时尚消费的趋势是通过各种方式购买更多，无论是二手购物、网购还是其他方式。

### 总结
作者探讨了时尚消费趋势的变化，认为未来将不再追求“每天穿新衣服”，而是更注重拥有个性化、标志性的单品，并通过重复穿着和个性化装饰赋予这些单品独特的意义。这种趋势将带来对物品的更深层次的情感依恋和认同感，并可能在2025年成为主流。

Watch that be like some sort of like really rude derogatory term. I always get, no, it's not called a pillock's. Oh, is it pillbox or pillock's? This is not what I'm looking for. This is wrong. It's a no brim hat, brimless hat.

I didn't end up buying it because the material was a little bit too cheap for my liking, but I've had my eye on those for a while now and I think they're going to be in. And last but not least, in the world of nautical fashion, this is not very fisherman aesthetic. This is not very, it's not even that nautical, like it is nautical, but it's like, it's a bit more elevated

Like a chic, classic pearl. I don't know. I could see it happening. Okay. That is what I think is going to be in in 2025. If I literally get one of those predictions correct, I will be so stoked. I mean, the truth of the matter is, 
[P110]  lot of those predictions aren't even fully predictions because a lot of them are already starting to pop up now or like they already were popping up last year, but maybe they just weren't mainstream yet.

These are the things that I predict are really going to go out. 
[P111]  of style in 2025. Number one, every single niche in aesthetic and core that happened in 2024, every single one. We really, really had a quick trend cycle last year. And I think every single thing that we experimented with last year is just absolutely over this year. Every trend that popped up last year, we wore to death.

I mean, like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I don't even know what the term for that would be, but you get the idea. Over the last few years, 
[P113]  There's been moments where it's been trendy to dress exactly like a certain era on the nose. OK, like Y2K on the nose. That was really trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 90s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing really 70s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 80s on the nose. This is all within the last five years. OK, at any point in time over the last five years,

[P16]  buy, you know, good basics and stuff. Like I think that's going to be really in and styling them in unique ways that have sort of magic. I think that's going to be in, but I don't think it's something we're ever going to look back at and cringe at, which is cool. It's cool when a trend also is timeless and it's rare. So I think this is one of the rare times when something timeless will be trendy. Moving on. Okay. So in 2024, the concept of 
[P17]  Jane Birkening your bag. Are we remembering this? This is the concept of taking your purse and attaching a bunch of personalized objects onto it, tying a bandana onto it, putting little charms on it, attaching jewelry to it, inspired by Jane Birken of the 60s, who carried around her iconic Birken bag that she attached a bunch of little accessories to that were personal to her. 
[P18]  and then gets a bit warm and then ties it around her purse to give her neck some air. That's the idea, right? Organically and authentically accessorizing her purse through necessity and convenience, weirdly enough, became a trend in 2024 where everybody was buying charms and finding bandanas and things in their drawers and then adding it to their bag to make it look authentic like Jane Birkin's bag. Fascinating trend. 
[P19]  think it's ending in 2025. I think it's going to expand in 2025. In 2024, it was all about the bag, right? Accessorizing the bag in that way.
