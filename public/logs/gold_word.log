输入内容：
[P141]  it all the time. I love a social question. Yeah. When it comes to, I do too. I don't, I don't see them out here. Do you have your, they did not give, we are missing our social question. I got one. I'm just kidding. All right, here we go. You ready for this one? Oh, shoot. Zach from TikTok asks, how much is enough or normal to spend on an engagement ring? I want Rachel's opinion on this so badly. I don't think I've ever talked to you about this. Isn't the, isn't like the jewelry people out there, don't they say three months and we say one? 
[P142]  generally we'd say one month salary is like a top limit. Sorry, one month salary. That's what I meant. Yeah. But three months out there, I think like Zales and, you know. I think they usually say a three month salary. Every kiss begins with K came up with like, it should be 17 months of your salary. I think it was, I think it was the diamond company. Like the people that did the diamonds, you know, decades ago. Debeer's or whatever. Debeer's, that's it. I was like, I don't want to mispronounce it. But I think they came up with the three month salary rule and we'd say, pull that back a little bit. A month. I think a month is great. But let's, yeah, 
[P143]  Weddings, engagements, rings. It is expensive, George. I'm glad that I'm out of that season. Because nowadays, like what people are spending to be in weddings, to go to all the stuff. And then the comparisons. Can I just be honest? It's the women on women comparisons of, oh, let me see the ring. Oh, that's cute. You know what I mean? Like the guys don't care. No man has ever cared. No. It's just like we don't want the woman to be upset. 
[P144]  No, it's from the lab and not a blood diamond. Oh, yeah. What do you think about? Yeah. I could give a rat's toot about where. Like, if that's what you're basing this marriage on. Well, was it? Did they work hard for the diamond or did a laboratory? Don't care. Get a moisonite. It's about the beauty of the ring. And does it match her personality? And does it make sense financially? Because that is an industry that you can spend so much on. My wife's ring was not that expensive. There you go. It's not a blood diamond. I'm not even sure it's a real diamond, Rachel.

主题：学生贷款 refinancing 建议

输入内容：
[P82]  Warshaw. Listen, I get it. The student loan situation is bananas, but it's time to make progress, not excuses. So if your payment and interest rate have you treading water, refinancing could be the solution for you. Look, if I were in your shoes, I would contact Laurel Road today and get a free 30 minute consultation. You'll work with a student loan expert and you'll go over your refinancing options. Hey, for refinancing to make sense, you've got to check certain boxes like making a good income. And bottom line, 
[P83]  Ramsey's advice is that you only refinance if you can get a lower rate or a shorter term. Remember, the point is to pay off debt faster. Maybe you just need to keep rocking the debt snowball. But if refinancing does make sense for you, Laurel Road offers low competitive rates and interest rate discounts are available for stuff like auto pay. Listen, you can't mess around with student loans. If you want them gone, you got to go hard. So go to laurelroad.com slash Ramsey to find out more and schedule your free 30 minute consultation.

[P60]  wise and as disciplined as you. I'm the most humble guy you know. All of it. But you can check out our Smart Money Happy Hour episode as well on YouTube and podcasts where we dive into this conversation even more. This is The Ramsey Show. 
[P61]  I used to be one of those guys. I didn't even think about it. And one of my buddies said, hey, the only reason to not have life insurance is if you hate your wife and kids. And I immediately went and got term life insurance. That's a gut punch. For decades, Dave, I've sat across people who've lost a spouse. They've lost somebody important to them. Me too. They don't know what to do next. You're going to have a crisis here. You know, you got two options while you're sitting and talking to a young widow. She's concerned about how she's going to invest all this money properly and not mess this up. Or she's concerned how she's going to eat tomorrow. That's exactly right. These are the two options. 
[P62]  saying I love you to your family, term life insurance. Jeff Zander and the team at Zander Insurance makes it easy and affordable. I've used them personally for 25 years. They're the only people I trust. Go to Zander.com or call 800-356-4282. The Employee Benefit Research Institute recently did a study asking people really have a million, asking how many people really have a million dollars saved for retirement. And according to the research, 
[P63]  3.2% of Americans have a million dollars or more in their tax advantage accounts like a 401k or an individual retirement account and IRA. 58% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved in their retirement. So as a Ramsey Show listener, the question is, are you staying on track with the baby steps to reach your financial goal? If you want to know that, make sure to take our quick quiz to check your progress and received a personalized plan that's just for you. So you can head to the show notes.

[P43]  or the link down below if you're listening on YouTube or podcast. All right, George, we had a Smart Money Happy Hour episode. You know, we have some that just, you can tell, have hit a nerve with the world in a good way. And we did one recently on things that scream, I'm pretending to be upper class. Because living a higher lifestyle than maybe what you can afford keeps you broke. I mean, when you are living beyond your means and trying to, in a way, kind of keep up with what everyone else 
[P44]  is doing will constantly lead you back to this idea of spending money that you don't need to spend. And sometimes you're spending money you don't even have to keep up this lifestyle. And you talk about comparisons a lot. So this segment hopefully will help you fight those comparisons and FOMO you feel amongst your friends. So here's some signs, some things that your friends may be doing people out there on Instagram that may show they're faking their upper class status. Number one, flashy designer logos. This is a big one. Most luxury items like a cashmere sweater never 
[P45]  have logos all over them. We've talked about stealth wealth. Yes. It's a new trend. It's called quiet luxury, stealth wealth. People that are actually really wealthy, you won't really know it. They don't really have all the flashy stuff that you just look at and you know exactly, oh, that hat, that jacket, those shoes, like you know exactly where everything's from. A lot kind of go under the radar. If you know, you know. If you know, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Secret society. Yeah, it's kind of that. That's like the new vibe, which is great. I think it's great. So yeah, that's number one. Number two is ordering 
[P46]  of wine when everyone knows that you're on a beer budget. Ooh. Hey, some of these beers now are crazy expensive. But yes, the wine does... That one feels like a ripoff to me personally. You know this, my stance. I do know this. I will not order wine at a restaurant. But if someone else buys a bottle, hey, I'm happy to share. Oh, I'm sure you are. I'll chip in. Take a glass from someone. Glasses of wine and cocktails can go for $20 a pop versus a beer. Or even better, just a water. What happened to just drinking water with a meal? Why do we got to add more 
[P47]  calories to the mix. And more money. And more money. See, that's not fun though. I do like an appetizer. I'll just have a water. Rachel's like, I'll have three appetizers and let's try a bunch of... I do. I love going out to eat. Rachel lives a little. I do. Number three is talking about money too much. So it's like, oh, I'm leveraging this debt for all this real estate. I think those are like some of the funniest Instagram reels that come up on my feed sometimes where people are like, I'm six 
[P48]  million dollars in debt and we are loving it and it's like showing all their vrbo's that they've bought in debt and all this stuff and you're just like no no it's exhausting and then you've got the crypto bros who are very loud right now because crypto is worth 14 billion dollars you know for the moment and so all these people talking loudly about money is usually a red flag to me maybe they don't actually have a lot yep uh next is flaunting wealth on social media 
[P49]  interesting one because I do think you can like use vacations for an example. You could see somebody at the same destination on social media, but the way they present themselves again, kind of back to that self wealth of like, Oh yeah, we're just like, maybe I'm showing you some of the stuff, but it's more of what we're doing or like, you know, the kids and the poor, I don't know, whatever. And then there's those that are like, Oh no, I'm going to take you around the suite that we have rented for the week, you know, or, uh, you know, we're going to, it, 
[P50]  It just feels like I want to show you this amazing life that I live. And then the kicker, they're like, and by the way, it was totally free with their credit card points. Sign up for my course if you want to. I'm like, oh my gosh, get out of here. It's true. It's true. Get out of town. Here's another one. Leasing luxury cars. Oh, yes. If you're a dude and you've ever posed in front of any vehicle, it's a hard no for me. Your dad didn't hug you enough and I'm sorry. That's just the truth. 
[P51]  That's usually draining their wallet. We just took a call earlier. It is. Guy's got a $1,200 car payment. Yeah. He may look like he's driving great when you see him, but behind the scenes, not doing so well. And leasing cars. You know the number one city? I read this somewhere, so don't. I don't want everyone in Dallas to hate me. Number one city? Of leased cars? Dallas. Dallas, Texas. That makes sense. Number one. A lot of young bros who are doing well for themselves. I guess. Got those Beamer. You know, and you're always leasing like a Beamer Mercedes. It's always like a. 
[P52]  It's a nice car. Where are the guys who are leasing the Honda Civic? They're not there. Does that exist? No, I don't think so. I don't think they make money off that, George. Okay. And then number six, over-accessorizing, flashy nails, expensive watches, loud hair, or loud hair slash makeup. That's what's on there. I don't know, just a lot. Yeah, and this, you know, obviously the watches leans more the dudes, but the women, the flashy nails, the loud hair and makeup, we could tone it down, you know? I know, but here's my thing. I'm all for accessorizing. 
[P53]  There's a limit. I know. Here's my thing with this, though, is, I mean, I do that. I get my nails done. Well, you follow a lot of, like, the influencer moms, and some of them are very sweet and authentic and being themselves, and then some fall into the category of this is a lot. Yeah. You're trying to portray a certain life. I would agree with that. Like, they wake up and they have full makeup. Who's believing this? This isn't real. This isn't real. So, yeah. So, all of these things, you know, can, again, scream, I'm pretending to be upper class. So, here's the thing, you guys. 
[P54]  taking upper class, how do we get there and be wise? Because again, none of these things in and of themselves, I wouldn't say, right? If you like order wine at dinner, if you do have a nice designer person, none of these things in and of themselves are bad. But when it becomes your whole persona and it's the only thing you're shooting for in life, and again, that you will put yourself in a financial position that's not wise in order to achieve these things, like that's where the caution flight, the caution lights come on. And if you're doing it with debt, it is a facade. It is a house of cards. You're artificially propping this up. 
[P55]  you can tweet this if you're listening out there whatever it is called whatever platform you're on whatever free speech platform you choose here it is Rachel you ready for this can't wait if you live fake rich you'll become real broke eventually you will be calling the show and life was great and now something happened and you're going I'm in a real pickle because of my financial decisions yes and so we just don't want that for you yep let it be real and yeah doing things again doing a budget living within your means saving up for an emergency fund getting out of debt 
[P56]  So you free up payments so that you can actually use your money to give, to invest, to buy a house that's actually, you know, reasonable for your income. You know, you're doing all these things. And again, they're not, it's not going to be like this flashy, beautiful, wonderful lifestyle 24 seven. It's not going to look like that, but there's going to be the steadiness and this like firmness of a foundation under you. And it's not all just like shaky and built on other people's money. That's right. Normalize the 10 year old used minivan. That's practical. 
[P57]  four car that's the real flex okay so let yeah so the minivan and everyone knows i love my we know your feelings about minivans yes i do love i love my minivan i think it's great it is wonderful but i will say the plastic on the side of the seats have popped off so two now are so when you get in my van there's like wires and have your kids been vandalizing this vehicle i feel like that's a personal problem i don't think that's on honda you know what i mean we can't blame the good people at honda for i know but i'm like oh my 
[P58]  gosh this like yeah i'm blaming chuck cruise he's been working out too much just ripping pieces of this van apart oh but it's you know but it's paid for that's what matters that's what's great stressful you know what i hit my garage the other day big old scrape on my car you know what i said yeah it's 12 years old it's fine who am i trying to impress rachel cruise she's not impressed what am i trying to do here so yeah there's a big old scrape on my car so good because i hit my garage all right if you are watching on 
[P59]  to comment below because we want to know some of your, you know, things that you see out and you're like, huh, are these people trying to, trying to be upper class and they're not, you know, share your stories, the lifestyle that's out there. And I would say a good bit of it's probably on social media. Can we be honest with that? It helps to just get off of there. I realized I stopped caring what other people think when I'm not looking for reasons to be angry and upset and jealous and envious. Just get off and live your life. George, if we could all be as well.

主题：Lee财务与婚姻问题咨询

输入内容：
[P64]  And click the link titled, Are You On Track With The Baby Steps? And complete the quiz for free. All right, let's go to the phones and let's talk to Lee in San Antonio. Hi, Lee. Welcome to the show. Hi, how are you all today? We're doing great. How can we help? So I have a question. I just got turned on to your show about a month ago and I've become an addict. I kind of learned about the baby steps several years ago from a friend of mine. 
[P65]  So just this week, I paid off my vehicle. I paid off all my personal loan except for my house. Did you have all this money sitting around and you just weren't willing to part with it? Yeah, kind of. I paid off all the credit card student loan. I took a lot of extra gigs as a contract nurse and stuff. Awesome. That's a big step. You drank the Kool-Aid. Way to go. I did. I did. So my question. I am married. We've been married for 30 years. 
[P66]  years. My husband is terrible with money. He has almost put us in the poor house three times. So about when I got turned on to this a couple of years ago, I've separated our finances completely because, you know, you give him a debit card, he has money. If he had checks, he had money. So we have never agreed on money. He doesn't make as much as I do, but he is definitely not hurting as far as his credit sucks. He can't go anywhere. Sorry for the word. 
[P67]  We've heard worse today. 
[P68]  he has to pay it because that was his mistake. He didn't say anything about it. He didn't report it. And now he gets to pay it. So going back a couple of weeks, I was listening to your show. And I know I heard you all talk about the Bitcoin and I'll sell it, whatever. But I do remember him mentioning something, and I haven't been able to find the show about if you had stock, like single stock. So when I worked in the hospital, I used to buy stock from them, and it wasn't much. But when I checked on it the other day, 
[P69]  Oh, wow. 
[P70]  $25,000. The tax bill is how much in your husband's name? Nine grand. Nine grand. That's not both our names, but it was his mistake because he took the money out of his 401k and got the taxes and penalties and all that. Yep. What did he use that money for? He didn't report it. I was gone. You have no idea what he spent it on? Does he have an addiction? He's frivolous. He likes to cook. He likes to buy junk. People don't rob their 401k to buy junk. 
[P71]  I cut him off from myself, like I said. He buys junk, believe me. He likes clothes. He likes junk. He does. Okay, so what's the total debt? Is it just the $9,000, or is there more where this came from? Well, his that I know of, that I'm on, is the $9,000. He did not tell me how much he has put into that thing. Those are his credit cards, whatever. He is not on mine. The house is in my name. My car is in my name. Everything is in my name. 
[P72]  Okay. So from a practical standpoint, Lee, I would probably pay it off because it's in your name. I mean, it's, yeah, for you guys, which sucks that it's his mistake. And I say sucks that it's his mistake because of the way you guys have been living. Yeah. So I would do that. I would, do you have money saved? Or are you on baby step one? My net worth, no, my net worth, I already have, I have my $1,000 in a separate account. I have paid all my accounts off. 
[P73]  My net worth with all my IRAs and investments, because I put money in investments when I was doing the COVID thing also and paying off loans and all. So my net worth, according to my Quicken account or whatever that is, or whatever was on my computer, because I'm not a really good money savvy person, is about $670,000. Way to go. That's great. My house only owes, I only owe $172,000 on my house right now. Okay. Okay. But you've been doing the solo, essentially. You're just like, whatever. 
[P74]  do you i'm gonna manage my money and not go into debt and get my goals and yes you're not dragging me down so the question to if you sell and the stock is in what again um it's in a hospital stock in a big uh corporate okay okay okay um yeah i mean i bought it years ago it was only like you know from payroll deduction and i've just kind of like left it on the back burner sure yeah and it's grown it was like 25 50 50 bucks when i bought it and now it's worth like 300 i mean it's 35 000 
[P75]  That's what I found out. That's amazing. So you'll probably, what's your, do you file single or married filing jointly at this point? Oh, we still do married filing jointly just because it's cheaper that way. And what was your income last year? Last year was 94, but this year I got it up and it's 97. Okay. So it'll likely fall into like a 15% capital gains tax on those stocks since you've owned them for longer than a year. It's going to be long-term capital gains tax and it'll likely be 15%. 
[P76]  I would talk to your tax pro about what that number actually would turn into because you'll need to have that, you know, be able to pay the taxes on that come tax time. But I would definitely sell these stocks, pay off that $9,000, and then fully fund your emergency fund. And then be putting the rest in your Roth 401k, or I'm sorry, your Roth IRA that you were saying, and just be putting... Well, because I just found out yesterday when I called my HR benefits and stuff, we do have Roth IRAs available here at my job. 
[P77]  I have just 401k. I'm sorry. Yes. Right. Okay. So that and your Roth IRA are going to be your friends because the great thing is when you take the money out, like versus this stock where you're having to pay capital gains, you wouldn't pay anything and you could just cash it out and it would be all $35,000 of yours. The only difference is you won't get the tax deduction come tax time because it's on the Roth side. Yeah, that's right. But that's worth it because of how much you're going to be making in interest over time. So I would do that. And then Lee, I mean, that's the... 
[P78]  If I sell it, I get it before I file my income taxes, put that into the $7,000 into my IRA for last year's, and then I could worry about the taxes on the long-term capital gains for this year. Yeah. I mean, that's one way to do it. Before tax time, you can fund last year's Roth IRA and HSA and all that stuff. So that would be a good thing to do. And then make sure you have your fully funded emergency fund set up before that. And if you have enough, you can fund the rest in that. 
[P79]  IRA. But the bigger glaring issue here is this marriage, Lee. It's like the elephant in the room. How long have you guys been married? Well, 30 years. So I did talk to an attorney and basically he was like, it's cheaper to keep him. Because you're going to have to split your assets and all that. I also want to think about the quality of your life and not just about the dollar signs, but I just feel for you. 
[P80]  Has it been 30 years of this? I mean, the way he handles money and the way he approaches money is the same as how he approaches life, correct? Yes. I mean, he's very, I mean, he's not a, I don't even know how to say it. He's an oxymoron on his whole world. I mean, he's, so the kids need him for something. He's there. He's never been not there. Yeah. He did have an infidelity issue years ago. I don't think that's a problem. It hasn't been a problem anymore, but. Okay. Well, 
[P81]  I would say this, Lee, too. Just for the wholeness of who you are as a person, what George is saying is, you know, making sure that you're a whole person and how you can do that best, you know, is your decision for sure. But I would keep my money separate at this point because he's not proven otherwise and I don't trust him. So I hope that helps, Lee. And good luck to you. Well done on all the progress. Thanks to all the guys in the booth. And Kelly, the lady in there. Oh, yeah. Taylor, we have some ladies in the booth. And you, George, is a great co-host. This is The Ramsey Show.

主题：Matthew财富积累后目标迷茫咨询

输入内容：
[P127]  yrefy.com slash Ramsey. That's the letter Y, R-E-F-Y.com slash Ramsey may not be available in all states. Today's question comes from Matthew in Idaho. My wife and I are millionaires after years of working through the baby steps. In the beginning, it was exciting. The baby steps happened fast and our children learned to have Christmas on a budget. But once we got to the point where we had an emergency fund, the house was paid off and we were building wealth, everything just started to seem very routine and boring. 
[P128]  going in our financial lives. If there was ever a Rachel Cruz question, this would be it. You were made for this question. George. You were so good about keeping your financial life excited. Yeah. Because you're the spender. You're like, I've got some ideas. Yeah. And they're like, he's like me. He's like, well, I like a financial goal. We saved the thing. We invested the thing. But now what? Goals. Now you have to actually figure out like who you are. I'm kidding. Find hobbies. That's right. Okay. So I always go back to this because it's 
[P129]  so spot on and I agree with it a hundred percent and it's science but Arthur Brooks talks about what you can do with money five things and four bring happiness and one does not so this is what I would say to him to Matthew you can give which brings happiness you can save which actually brings happiness because it shows progress you can buy experiences with people you love and that brings happiness you can buy your time back and then use your time well spent right so if you have someone mow your lawn 
[P130]  I'll mow the lawn, but you get time back, but go work out or like go do something productive. And then number five, you can spend money on stuff, but that does not produce joy. And then Ray MC, we always talk about, you can give, save and spend, right? So kind of using that framework, if I were you, Mike, I mean, if there isn't a big goal out there, and I would say Winston and I, we've kind of gotten to this place. Our house was a massive goal. That was in 2019. And then we made it a goal for a pool and we actually were finished. We're done now, I know. So what we took, 
[P131]  I guess probably five years to save for that. And so now we're at this point when we were planning our 2025 of like, okay, we don't really have a big financial goal in place. And I would say that for a time period, I think that's okay because we shifted the excitement and like, hey, what's the next thing to some of those things Arthur Brooks talks about? So like plan a fun trip with your family, like have some experiences with them. Give someone a trip, right? If you have the money, like are there people in your life that you could bless them of like, oh gosh, 
[P132]  couple really helped us walk through some hard times and we want to give them a weekend away right and like like what are things you can do and then the giving aspect which once and I even changed some of our giving goals this year um and we are we like have a percentage now in our every dollar budget that is above our tithe above everything else we do and it's spontaneous giving and we're going to force ourselves every month to do it and to say yeah well like where can we give spontaneously to someone throughout the month if we hear a story if we experience someone you know at a 
[P133]  restaurant, a waiter or waitress, like give an insane tip. Like what are ways we can do that? And that fueled my excitement, George. Like when we planned all this out a few weeks ago, as we were kind of talking through the year, it was like, okay, we don't have a big goal, quote unquote, we're saving for. There's no baby step eight. Yeah, yeah. But we're being more creative with our giving, which does make it more exciting. We are going to travel some this year. So we put that in the budget. So yeah, so like leaning in on these things that actually will bring you joy. And I'll probably, you know, buy some shirts from Abercrombie, you know, it's just what I do. 
[P134]  But overall, where do we put our time and our energy and our money? Put it in the stuff that's going to bring you joy and excitement. And for me, that's giving and experiences. But that's probably just my personality. No, you nailed it. I think there's usually a flat tire situation when you're really good at saving and investing. And then the giving side usually is a little lackluster. And you have a hard time just spending for fun because it feels frivolous after everything you've been through. Are you speaking out of your experience, George? This is me. This is me. I'm working on my flat tire, Rachel. 
[P135]  a little more. But I relate to Matthew's situation because the baby steps are so great because it gives you a very exact process. If you do this thing, you'll hit this goal. And then you get to baby step seven and it's a choose your own adventure of live and give like no one else. Yes. Yeah. And so that's where he has to figure that out for himself. And maybe that is, we need to find some hobbies. Maybe I'm going to try golfing or I want to get back into this thing that I used to love as a child. And I really need to pick back up piano lessons. Yes. Whatever the thing is for you and your family, 
[P136]  and go, hey, this is something we never thought we would do. Or back in the day, we were like, nope, we can't do that. What can you say yes to now that was a no five years ago? Yes, that's good. That's really good. Make that list. Yeah, of what are things that we, yeah, what should we do? And you got, you and Winston just did your annual dream date recently. Yes, that's what I was talking about. Yeah, and we had the, we had every dollar for our monthly budget up and then we had Excel and Winston has all these crazy formulas of like implementing taxes. I don't know, he has all this like, he does it all. I got to get that spreadsheet. 
[P137]  from Winston. I need some new formulas in my life. Yeah. And that's the interesting thing is people really do, you know, on the show we talk about, you know, for a lot of listeners and for those of you that are new to the baby steps, a lot of people are starting out on baby step one. They're just trying to get that thousand dollars and pay off debt, right? But this, this long journey of money, I always want you guys to hear from us on this show that the goal of building wealth and being in a really secure place in baby step seven, where you don't even have a house payment, your house is paid for, retirement's being funded, like all of that. 
[P138]  It's not just to continue just to get more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more, right? There is an outflow that needs to happen. You need to do things with your family, give to others, give others great experiences in life. Like there is something about using money as a tool. It's not something to hoard and to keep, but you're doing this to leave a mark on the world. I mean, there's something beautiful about that that I think is really innate and how we're created. And so leaning into some of that, because I do think there can be this mindset, 
[P139]  on, you know, maybe Baby Steps like four, five, six, where there's like, my goal is just to like, get money, get money, get money, get money, which right, you're funding retirement, you're wanting stability. But there's been listeners here that have been with us for eight, nine, 10 plus years that are Baby Steps millionaires. And they're like, yeah, and they're on the other side. And the ones we talked to that have this joy about them, this countenance about them that we meet, it's because they've been able to do some cool stuff. And every now and then they'll drop their story to us, you know, the things they get to do. But I don't know, 
[P140]  There's something about this whole idea of building wealth. It's not just to build wealth. It is what you do with that wealth that brings you a level of joy and happiness and how we're created. Beautifully said, Rachel. Gosh, no notes. No notes. No notes. So Matthew, spend some money. Go on a great trip and be a generous giver. Go find things that bring you joy with giving because that's the best. All right, George, there are some social questions

[P2]  your life, relationships, anything and everything. We're going to start off this hour with Alex in Cleveland, Ohio. Hi, Alex. Welcome to the show. Hi, thanks. How are you guys doing today? We're doing great. How can we help? So I am 23 years old. I roughly have about $90,000 in debt. 
[P3]  Okay. 
[P4]  student loans and $6,000 on credit cards. I did complete baby step number one, working on number two. My mom also mentioned that she thinks I should file for bankruptcy. I'm not sure if that's the best solution, but I just wanted to get your guys' thought on that. No, on the bankruptcy. I'll just say that. Yeah, first and foremost. We're not there. We're not even close. So there's some good news for you. I think mom wants you to get a clean slate 
[P5]  She's kind of wanting you to just shortcut this and be free from the pain. But there's better options here. And so let's talk about the car. Instead of a voluntary repo, could you sell it and come up with the amount you're underwater on? The car is only worth about $25,000. Did you roll negative equity? I might be able to. No, did you? From a previous car. 
[P6]  half of that? The interest on it is 25%. Oh my goodness. When I bought the car, it was during COVID. I needed a new car. Didn't have much credit and they would only approve me for a brand new car. I could not get approved for a used car. And you said, sure, 25% sounds good. 
[P7]  That's reasonable. Let's go. I need this $50,000 car. And when you're making $150,000, this is the problem. You feel like, okay, well, I can afford the payments. And if I can afford the payment, everything's fine. And that's the backwards way of going into when it comes to buying a car. But that's what a lot of people do. I can afford the payment. So regardless of how much interest it is, I can afford it. And then life happens, as you've experienced. Okay, job-wise, Alex, what were you doing before? You said you had two jobs that you lost. 
[P8]  What were those? I was a payroll manager for an IT company, and then I was an assistant manager for a retail store. Okay. And what happened to those jobs? The retail store ended up closing down, and I wasn't able to get relocated, and the IT firm also shut down. Oh, okay. So both companies closed. What are you doing now? 
[P9]  Okay. Okay. Um, single family, kids, single. Okay. Where are you living? Uh, Cleveland. Okay. Are you living alone? Renting? Uh, rent, uh, with a roommate, um, 1300 split between the two of us. Okay. That's good. Um, okay. So yeah, I mean the, getting the car out, do the 25,000 that it's worth, where did you pull that number from, from a dealership or from like Kelly Blue? 
[P10]  book uh kelly blue book and a couple other like just look uh like browsing seeing like what similar um but it's not trade-in value that's private party value yes private party oh man yeah because the problem is you need to come up with the difference even if you do a voluntary repossession they're going to sell it at auction for way less than it's even worth and you're still going to owe the difference yeah so it doesn't really it doesn't solve all of your problems to even do the voluntary repo that's why we're trying to find another solution 
[P11]  where you come up with the difference. I'd rather you be 25 grand in debt driving a beater than 47 grand in debt. Yeah, and that's kind of my thought process too. Trust me, I know this was probably the worst financial decision I've ever made. But yeah, I'd rather drive a hoopty at this point than, you know, drive this up. Are you able to keep current with your other bills, Alex, right now making 60? Yes. You are. 
[P12]  So your debt is not ongoing to keep lights on and everything? No, I'm slowly paying that off, thankfully. I mean, honestly, Alex, if I were in your shoes, I mean, I would figure out a way. I mean, it's about 18K for the difference of the car, and you're probably not going to be able to get a loan for the difference. Well, you said you owe 47 on the car? 43. Oh, 47. Oh, I wrote the 43. Okay. So you're 22 under. 
[P13]  local credit union, get a loan for the difference, maybe 25 grand and spend three of that on a beater car. But I don't know that they'd even grant you that loan at this point. Have you tried? No, I haven't tried. I kind of wanted to search all my options beforehand. Sure. That's the least harmful of the options is to go to a credit union and see if you can get the difference in a loan and maybe a little bit more in order to get a beater car, get rid of this payment, and then you'll be climbing your way out of this. And then hopefully in the meantime, 
[P14]  to six figures. Because clearly you're skilled enough and you're willing to do the work. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, if you can get that 60 up for a full-time job and find something 75 or 80, right, in like a perfect world. And then the side hustle is, I mean, that's what I would be doing, Alex. And I'm like, if you can make, God, I mean, you'd have to make 3,000 extra a month. I mean, I'm trying to do the math of how to do this within a year to get to even save the amount for the difference, right? So best bets, you can take a loan for the difference. 
[P15]  And like George said earlier, a local credit union is going to be your best bet versus a bank. They're the ones that are probably actually going to sit down with you and run more numbers and look. But so that would be my first option. And then if not, that's probably what I would do. I would probably try to get out of this car before anything else, even before the... It solves half your problems. Yeah. Yeah. If you can get out of that. And then now the second half, at least that's bearable. And you can climb out of that pretty quickly, even making what you make. 
[P16]  problem. But I do think income is the biggest part. And then your lifestyle is going to have to get cut down to nothing for probably the next 18 months. Yeah. And so this is no eating out. This is, hey, the roommate wants to, sorry, I can't hang out. I'm working three jobs. It's not going to be a fun journey. But the good news is you're young enough that you have a lot of time to make up for this. And so all hope is not lost. You don't need to go file for bankruptcy. George, would you, if you were him, would you save the $25,000 first, get the car out? 
[P17]  and then do the debt snowball? Ideally. I know. I just don't know how quickly he's going to save up $25. Yes, that is. Because I do wonder, Alex, too, if you paid off the six credit cards and did just the traditional debt snowball, how much payments monthly will be freed up because those are paid off. So even just working down the debt snowball, but knowing you have a freaking $1,200 car payment until you get to it to pay off is not fun. But in the meantime, I almost would just work the debt snowball until you get there. But thanks for the call, Alex. Good luck to you. We learn from our mistakes, George. We learn from our mistakes.

主题：Mike家庭财务困境咨询

输入内容：
[P104]  Thank you. 
[P105]  Welcome back to the Ramsey Show. Up next, we have Ethan. Oh, we have Mike. Sorry, Mike in Asheville, North Carolina. Hi, Mike. Welcome to the show. Hey, how are y'all doing? I got a good one for you. Okay, perfect. 
[P106]  We did a big remodel. It was about $100,000 that we've invested to create home offices. As a result, we kind of credit carded everything, and we've been living paycheck to paycheck for a while, and I just lost my job this week. We were trying to do a refinance, and that fell through. And so long story short, we went from about $195K in income to about $65K and looking for advice. 
[P107]  We're not allowed to sell it for at least a year. And the remodel is not quite finished. Oh, boy. Okay. Is that more than just getting the two home offices during COVID? Y'all done more remodeling? Yeah, it was extensive. We kind of expanded the second floor and just with the goal of ultimately selling. But it's obviously when I lost my job, it was kind of a deal where it kind of put the brakes on everything even more. 
[P108]  and paycheck to paycheck. And so we're obviously doing it the wrong way. So looking for advice on how to get out of this. How much more debt do you have? What's the total amount? And break it down for us. Okay, so the mortgage is $202,000. And we have things like cars and credit cards. And a lot of that is just due to the remodel. But it's $210,000 and other non-mortgage debt. Oh, my goodness. Well, we can sell the cars. 
[P109]  what do the cars have to do with the remodel? They don't. Yeah, so the cars we're paying, one of them is $394, the other one is $380 a month. How much do you owe on the cars? How much debt's on them? Yeah, approximately $28 in total. Okay, break them down. What's each one? Well, one of them is about $13,500, the other one's $15. Okay. 
[P110]  I'm confused. You said you had $210,000 in other debt and only $28,000 of that as cars. You're saying the rest of that is credit card debt? Well, unfortunately, we had like a foundation loan. A bunch of it's credit card. I have a student loan at about $20,000. And I think, yes, the rest of it is either small loans like through Home Depot or credit cards, correct. And what were you doing for work where you guys were making about $200,000? 
[P111]  Software developer. Okay, and what are you doing now? I am looking for work, but I'm going to work on some certifications. I took a job that wasn't ideal for obviously my career and skill set, and so that's something I'm going to be working on is some probably Azure certifications. Are they going to cost money? A little. The test, the actual certification exam is only $165. But then you need to, is there some kind of online? 
[P112]  education you need to get that will cost money? Or can you just do the certification test? I can. There are some sample tests and some certification videos that are very helpful, but it's minimal charges, if any. And how quickly do you think you could get a job making six figures as a software developer? Well, I've applied for a bunch of jobs already, but it's a matter of finding the right fit. I would like 
[P113]  to focus on the skill set to some extent, but probably in two weeks, I would be able to pass that certification. Okay. If I was in your shoes, Mike, right fit would be a luxury and a privilege. Right now, I'm going, who is willing to pay me $100,000 to write some code? And I'm going to do that so I can survive. Because right now, I don't see a way out of this with your monthly payments and your income. You guys are going to continually go into debt. Is your wife working, Mike? Yes. Okay. Is she making the 65? 
[P114]  Yes. Okay, so if you made 100, then you guys could get back up to 165. Yeah, well, I was at 130, but yes. Okay, yeah. So, I mean, ideally replacing that completely like what you're saying. And then, yeah, I mean, and then from there, Mike, it's just a complete overhaul and mindset shift and change on how you guys have been viewing money. And you said it at the beginning of the call, so I'm not telling you anything you don't know, 
[P115]  been doing it, it has to be the complete opposite. So this is cutting up credit cards. This is, I mean, if any of your cars have equity in them, I would just sell them and get a $5,000 car. I mean, I would do the complete opposite of everything I've been doing up until this point because that's where you're actually going to start to see some progress. And I really feel like, Mike, you guys need some quick wins in here. Yes, the income is number one. But I would be cutting up credit cards tonight. I mean, no more. No more. 
[P116]  Like you guys are not in a place to even have them around because so much of this is credit card debts. And I know it was all in, you know, because of the remodel, but the whole mindset, yeah, of going in when you don't have the money, it just, that can't be it anymore. And then, you know, walking through the debt snowball of paying off and breaking all these out too. So when you say, yeah, some of these are credit cards, breaking each specific credit card out. So you guys may have a long list of debts, 
[P117]  knocking these out that's where that momentum starts are you guys able to stay current on payments right now well we had a small severance um but it was only five thousand dollars and so um our current just our debt load is like a little over sixty two hundred dollars for the month and so um the money we've got you know in hand will you know in my last a month yeah i mean you guys are you're on the edge of 
[P118]  running out and going back into more debt. And so can you go do three side jobs this week? Yes. It doesn't have to be software. It could be Instacart, Shipt, Uber, Handyman, whatever skills you have, go do it to bring in something while you look for that work. I had one job where I picked up some work to do some light remodeling for a lady, and that was $530. 
[P119]  You're pretty handy. I've collected about half of that. Yeah. I mean, I'm doing the remodel myself. So yeah. Okay. Well, today we start Mike's handyman business and you're going to charge 50, 60, 70 bucks an hour and put it on your neighborhood Facebook group and hand out some flyers and go, I'm doing good work and I show up on time and get referrals, word of mouth and get this business going and do as much of it as you can until you get that next software developer job. Okay. That's what I would be doing if I had your skillset. Yeah. And I think what's hard, 
[P120]  Mike, is there's a level of like deep humility that you're going to have to have in this process because between now and getting your new job, making anything and doing work that maybe you never thought you would be doing is what's necessary right now, right? Because I don't want you guys, like what George was saying, to get behind. So bringing in a thousand, two thousand, three thousand a month on numerous things that you're pairing together and you're working late. I mean, do you guys have kids at home? Yes, two. How old are they? 
[P121]  Yeah, so 14 and 17. Okay. Do they know about any of this? I'm sorry? Do they know about your financial situation at all? To some extent, yes, high level. Okay. It might be good to sit down with them and have a hard conversation and say, listen, the next year or two, it's going to look different for our family. We used to go do stuff and eat out and do all these sports, and right now we've got to really tighten up and get out of this financial mess. 
[P122]  like yeah and even if your wife can work overtime mike too um i mean i would be doing that i mean again income is going to be your best bet and then cutting lifestyle which we're just saying and it's going to be um yeah i mean i mean if you guys if you get back up to that 195 i would be living like i made 80 because the 65 000 is covering the bills basically per month right i mean i mean living on seriously on nothing and that's you could you could really turn this around if you could throw 
[P123]  which sounds wild, wild numbers here. But if you could throw a hundred grand a year out of that non-mortgage debt in two years. Yeah. I mean, seriously. I mean, there's, there's some big changes you can, yeah. Selling the cars, getting rid of what you can, selling stuff to my go around your house, sell all the crap you guys that, you know, that you have doing what you can. But if you hold on the line, Taylor's going to pick up and we're going to give you financial peace university. It's our nine lesson course and you and your wife sit down together and even your kids and watch this. You guys binge that this weekend because, um,

But we have one small hurdle that we got to jump over to get there and differing opinions kind of on how to resolve it 
[P86]  and maybe you guys can break a tie for us. Perfect. Can't wait. What is it? What's going on? All right. So we've knocked out all of our debt using the baby steps. We paid off about $350,000 worth over about two and a half years. Wow. $350,000 you guys paid off? Yeah. Well, not all paid off. We sold stuff. I mean, we had everything under the sun. Wow. Well done. Automobiles and campers and I don't even like camping. So all we have left now is our primary home and we do have a vacation home. 
[P87]  And what we want to do is sell our primary home and move into the vacation home, which we like better anyways. And basically, the net proceeds from selling our main house will pay off our vacation home, which will become our primary residence. Wow, great. Yeah, so we're ready to go. The problem is I bought the vacation home prior to our marriage, and I unfortunately bought it from a friend. He's carrying the note. And when I kind of brought up to him, you know, excited that, hey, I'm going to have a big check for you, he kind of pushed back. 
[P88]  And, you know, he's kind of saying he wants to spread his capital gains tax over the 10 year note that we'd agreed upon at the 4% interest rate and kind of just, you know, park his money in that investment. So my question is, how do I how do I do this? I don't want to burn a friendship. My wife wants me to just slap a check on his desk, but she doesn't have to play golf with him on Saturday morning. So I'm not really sure how to approach this conversation without, you know. So he basically kept the mortgage in his name and you just pay him the mortgage payment. 
[P89]  and he pays for it. No, we did it all legit. We went through a title and escrow company and we drafted up a purchase agreement. And basically it's just a loan from him, basically. You know, I did a 20% down payment with him and I do pay him, you know, basically as the bank. But I am on the title, the deed, all that stuff. Okay, okay. So it is your home. Correct. I mean, yeah, it's your home and he's just the bank is what that is. Just seller financing. Yes, correct. 
[P90]  And I wish I didn't do this because now I'm in this situation. But, yeah, basically when I brought up to him that, you know, I owe him about $500,000, and, you know, I have the ability, well, Will, once we sell this primary home, to pay him off. But he just doesn't sound very excited about it. He wants to just go per the terms of our agreement, pay it off over 10 years so he can, you know, expense that capital gains over the 10 years rather than all at once. Has he actually talked to a tax pro to see if this loan repayment counts as income? 
[P91]  have to pay tax on the interest portion of it, I think. And then, you know, on the principal, he's, you know, it's capital gains rate, I believe, because it was paid off, you know, for him. Yes. So to answer your question, yes, he said he talked to his CPA. And basically, if I pay it off, he will have to pay capital gains on the proceeds. Yeah. Is there anything in the contract that you signed with him that would prohibit you from just paying it off? And that's the issue. There's not. I've read over it a hundred times, and it's like, legally and all that, I can, you know, 
[P92]  go pay it off. Yeah. So boo-hoo, friends. Here's your 500,000. You're going to have to pay taxes on it. Did he not make money off of this? Did he not benefit from this whole thing? No. Yeah. He's going to make a lot of money off of it. You know, he bought it 25 years ago. So he's going to make quite a bit. I guess my worry is that I'm either going to upset my wife or my friend, right? Because it's like... Or your life, Justin. Or your life. You guys have freaking paid off $350,000. 
[P93]  life and you did this side deal with a friend and your life has changed and your priorities and your goals have changed. And so, sorry, friend. It's not like you're putting your friend in debt. Boo hoo. He gets $500,000 and he's going to have to pay some taxes on it. He can wipe his tears with $100 bills. Sorry, dude. And I'm being very insensitive. If I were you, I would feel much worse because it is a good friend. I don't have a lot of empathy for the friend. I mean, yeah, Dustin, the writing's on the wall. You have to do what's best for you and your family. It'd be very unwise. 
[P94]  to make an unwise financial decision for you and your family because of the feelings of a friend. And so I guess that's going to be a hard conversation I need to have with him and say, listen, this is our goal. And I think you can give him some time and say, hey, I'm not doing this tomorrow. You know, our goal is to do this in 12 months or whatever the goal is for you guys when you sell your primary home, all of that. Like if you can kind of map out a timeline, give him some time and space and just say, hey, yeah, this isn't happening tomorrow, but it will be happening in the next year. 
[P95]  I looked over the agreement that we signed and I'm sorry, I know it's not ideal in your situation, but like, this is, this is our values and our priorities with our families to be completely debt free. And, um, and, and yeah, this is what we're, we're deciding to do. And again, Dustin, you're not like completely screwing the guy. Like it's, you know what I mean? Like you're not paying you the debt back. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. He's a little older and that was part of it too, is he's like, well, you know, and he gave me a great interest rate at 4%. He's like, well, you know, I can kind of guarantee to make my 4% in that 
[P96]  money where, and he, like I say, he's a little older. In reality, he can just go park that in a high yield and make that. That was kind of the point I was trying to bring up to him. And he just didn't seem jazzed about it. And it put me in a weird situation where I'm like, man, I don't want to like burn a friendship with a guy that I, you know, I've had a long friendship with, but at the same time, I'm not matching up with the gold. And I'll be honest too, if you're a friend, I'm like trying to put myself in his position, right? If I ever was in that deal. And I had a young guy come to me and be like, you know, oh my gosh, we're able to get out of this deal. 
[P97]  because we have the cash, we have the money, we're so excited, we're going to be debt free. You would hope that it doesn't burn a friendship, that in fact, he celebrates with you. And you know what I mean? Which I know this way of thinking is different to celebrate being debt free. And be thankful a friend paid me back, which is very rare in today's world. And the other thing, Dustin, is that when he loaned you this money, the relationship already changed. It turned into a business partnership transaction and it moved away from friendship. And so this is what happens with friendship. So the truth is, 
[P98]  If you pay it off and he decides to not be your friend, was he really your friend? Yes, George. He's sure. There's a piece of it, though. I know what you're saying. I would never burn a friendship over them paying me back. Yeah, that's it. That's what I'm saying. If he really, Dustin, is not your friend anymore after this, then to George's point, then he's looking to make money off of you. You know what I mean? It feels weird if he is going to cut ties with you as a friend because of this move. That's weird. 
[P99]  Yeah, that would be weird. I don't think that would happen. It's just, I guess I'm, you know, I hate to even say this. I guess I'm kind of just being a sissy about having the conversation because of the vibe I got when I brought it up, you know, a couple of times over. And I even told, you know, my thought was just, let's just park our money that we make from the primary home in a high yield and just pay him off. And then I kind of, you know, we're quote unquote, we feel debt free ish because the money's there. But my wife says, you know, she's so excited because we did so good on the first, you know, six steps, call it, that she's ready to just get, 
[P100]  Finish, quote unquote, finish the journey and be done. Yes. My wife, her vote counts 1000 times more than any of my friends. And I love my friends. And you have a little bit of that people pleaser in you, Dustin. I hear it. And so, yeah, this is grown up stuff and be a man, suck it up and talk to him. And again, if he is weird after this because of this whole thing, like that's a weird guy. I'm going to add this to one more reason to not borrow money from friends. That's the new book. And family. 
[P101]  Yes, all of it. This is The Ramsey Show.

主题：Tammy房产与债务问题咨询

输入内容：
[P23]  Milwaukee. Hey, Tammy, welcome to the show. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Absolutely. I am 34 and I have had a couple of houses. I went through a nasty divorce a couple of years ago, bought a house, sold it and bought this one. And this is where I'm in a little bit of trouble. I bought this house debt free. So I had a paid off car. 
[P24]  put 20% down. So I thought it was in good shape. Yeah. Until one thing after another kind of broke and I was fixing things. And now that I've been watching you guys for the last six months, I know that I should not have taken this large of a mortgage because it's about half of my income. Of your take-home pay? Yes. Oh. So what do you make and what's the mortgage? Sure. 
[P25]  I have a few jobs now. So my first income is about $4,000 a month. That's my primary job. And I see that keep going up and I'm trying to get promotions and doing well. And then I also bartend on the side. So that helps. And then I'm about to start doing taxes on the side. So coming up here, hopefully. Okay. How much do you make bartending? 
[P26]  a month, would you say? About $400, $500. I try to be conservative with that number. A month? Okay. Yeah. Okay, perfect. And what's your mortgage payment every month? $2,000. All right. Got it. Okay, so how can we best help you today? I'm wondering if I should sell my house because it is a lot. Yeah. Or if I just keep hustling because what it 
[P27]  it did was it put me into debt. Um, I was also paying for school and I made the mistake of putting that on my credit card. Um, how much other debt do you have? 37,000. Okay. Is that all credit card? Um, one is a personal loan and the arrested credit card. Okay. Um, I mean, yes, Tammy, the only reason I would say and kind of get to that answer pretty quickly with the house, 
[P28]  is that you would have to basically double your income for this to make sense. And you are saying that you see your income going up. But what I would want is the side hustle income not be part of the equation for your mortgage because I want to get you to a point in your financial journey that you're not having to have a side hustle to keep your mortgage, right? It's not sustainable. Yeah, you want just like your regular income to be able to support your main four walls and more. 
[P29]  long have you been in the house um i just hit two years uh last summer so i'm good on the capital gain side yeah okay how um how much do you owe on it what could you sell it for um i owe 275 uh and i think i could probably get 410 410 yeah oh wow it went up a lot in two years 
[P30]  Okay. So I'm more in the suburbs. Yeah. But it definitely did, and I put a lot down, and I think that might have been another. Yeah, that's true. That's fair. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fair. So if you sold it after fees, you would net probably $110,000 or so, maybe $120,000 if you're lucky? Yeah, I kind of assumed it would be around that $100,000 just because of real estate. Okay. And then you could then pay off your $37,000 in debt, leaving you with another $60,000 plus to then begin a new down payment fund while you rent. 
[P31]  kids Tammy when you divorced or is or no kids no okay so it's just you okay just me and a dog okay no that's great so yeah I mean honestly Tammy you know our goal when at least when I'm giving this advice and George would be the same is it's ultimately leading you to have a level of control over your money that ultimately then gives you peace that's what we want right I mean if you build wealth and do all of this that's later in the baby steps and that is so doable for people but the biggest component here is peace and Tammy I don't feel like you have a lot of peace when have your 
[P32]  is going to just the mortgage and you have $37,000 of other debt that you're having to pay and you're having to keep up the house. I mean, there's just not, it doesn't sound like a lot of peace. Would that be true? Yeah. I mean, I've paid off like $5,000 in the last six months ever since falling your baby steps. Oh, great. Which is great. But I don't know if it's enough. Right, right. And I don't want to work 80 hours a week. Yes, totally, totally. At that pace, it's going to take you another 40 months to get rid of the debt you took on. 
[P33]  on top of covering your mortgage, which is already consuming a lot of your take-home pay. So I can feel the stress of all of that making things worse. Yeah, so I think a good goal to shoot for, Tammy, is I probably would. I would sell the house. I would use some of that money to pay off your debts. I would use some of it for an emergency fund. And then I would quickly get back into a house or into real estate in general. Because I think you can put yourself in a position where you're not a renter forever. But it may even look like a townhome or a condo 
[P34]  something, right? It may not be even a single family home, or if it is, it's smaller and it's way more doable. Cause I do think, you know, prices with homes, they continue to go up. So I don't want people on the sideline for too long. But a move like this, I think will open up so much margin for you. And you'll be able to have kind of a clear head to go and purchase something again. Cause I do think you'll be in a position soon to buy something. Yeah. It's not quitting on home ownership. It's just getting your head above water to do it with a 
[P35]  feels like. I mean, you can give it six months and see if you can get your income way up, like Rachel said, before you sell. It's not like an on-fire sell today, but it just feels like if there's no end in sight where this is going to get easier and you're going to continue to go into debt, then I think the writing's on the wall that it's wise to sell. Yeah. And then I'll follow your plan of 25% of my income. That would be nice. That's right. That's right. It's not a fundamentally, you got to do 20. It's just that when it's 50%, life is hard. When it's 25%, 
[P36]  Yeah, I mean, if it was $1,000 right now, right, compared to your income, that changes. I mean, that's $1,000 freed up right there. And if you, you know, work hard and bartend and maybe do double what you're doing, that's $2,000 coming in extra a month to pay off this other debt, right? It just kind of ends up working so much more in your favor in that way. Is there a growth plan for you to make five, six, seven grand a month in your current role? That's complicated. 
[P37]  So I'm not sure. Is it time to look for another company? I have started looking. I'm a loyalist, so we'll see. But maybe it is time. Maybe I need to dig into that further. I mean, for your skill sets, would you say you could ROI better out in somewhere else and you're staying because you love this company? Or do you think, no, like I'm worth this amount, even if I transferred to another company? No, I just graduated. 
[P38]  Okay. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, Tammy, it feels like there's some big moves coming up in the future, which is all positive, though. That's it. I'm like, it's freeing you up more and more, giving you more peace and control. And I think it's going to be an incredible thing. I really do. Yeah, renting is not a waste of money if it's going to buy you peace. That's right. For a period of time, for sure. And then you can save up for a down payment on your next property, and you can just keep that ball rolling. Thanks for the call, Tammy. This is The Ramsey Show.

主题：Morgan 亲属悲剧后财务问题咨询

输入内容：
[P149]  14th my sister-in-law passed away unexpectedly oh my gosh morgan that was just what two weeks ago two weeks ago um she's 38 and they have three children and it's been pretty tough i'm so sorry oh thank you that's heartbreaking um so what um how are they how are they doing 
[P150]  five and two. Um, the 15 year old is, um, is from a previous relationship. So I think financially her father is able to provide a lot, but, um, to be honest, they weren't prepared. I mean, nobody is, but, um, he's kind of in a financial mess. Okay. So I have a few numbers. I don't have all the details because it's still very fresh, but I've gathered a few things. Um, to my knowledge, they don't have very, I don't think they have any savings. Okay. Um, 
[P151]  their house two years ago for $170,000. I believe their mortgage is $1,400 a month. Okay. I think he makes, they both worked for a trucking company. I think he's in like the 70 to 80 range. Okay. And I believe she was about 60 to 70. So he's losing half of her income. Yeah. And also she was getting $1,700 a month in veteran benefits. And they did not pay for the survivor. No survivor benefits. So he lost that too. 
[P152]  have any life insurance on her? I think she had a small policy through her work, maybe $20,000. No will. They have $15,000 in credit card debt. Two cars. One has a small loan. I believe it's her car. And she may have a small 401k. She may. My question is, she might. I'm not sure. Is that him wondering if he does, or is it you just saying she might? It's me wondering because my wife and I have been following the 
[P153]  Dave steps for years. So we're on four, five and six. So my brain automatically went to right up the baby steps. I was just trying to gather everything I have. So that is kind of a high level overview. So I don't know if he should take her life insurance and just try to walk up the baby steps. I don't know if credit cards that are only in her name, if I should tell him to stop paying because autopsy results are pending. And so we may not get the death certificate for about two months. So I don't know if he can do much of anything until we get a death certificate. Yeah. 
[P154]  Oh, Morgan, I'm so sorry. So in these kind of situations, when there's something so unexpected and so tragic, we usually advise the families not to do anything major for probably about 12 months because there is... And that's why I haven't asked these questions yet. This is just kind of what I've gathered because this is, I mean, this is so heavy. It's just pure grief. Right, right. And he doesn't, I mean, he can't even probably, you know, 
[P155]  put together a thought. And so for you just to kind of be a side support, right. Um, and at least be able to gather and do, you know, some level of work for him is such a gift, Morgan. I mean, I mean, honestly, you're, uh, you're, you're giving them such a gift by even kind of navigating this part of their lives because everything, yeah. I mean, I just, I can't even imagine. Um, so I, you know, I wouldn't do anything again, big, um, from a decision standpoint, unless 
[P156]  they get to a point where there is something big, right? If they get six months into this and he can't pay the mortgage and there's foreclosures pending or like something like really big, right? Then we have to make some big decisions. But whatever I think he can do to the degree of staying somewhat afloat for a year, maybe some small things and we can maybe talk to you about those here on this call. But overall, I wouldn't make any big, big decisions. So I think, 
[P157]  um, because again, the emotion, you just can't see straight, you know, um, she handled all the finances. So he's trying to just open bills. What accounts do we have? I mean, he's starting from scratch. So it's, it's just tough all around. Oh, it's kind of where he's starting. Like he said, you know, I'm going to Verizon today to get my name on all the accounts. He's on a scavenger hunt while graving. I mean, that's, that's the hardest. Yeah. That's the hardest part is that life continues on right in the middle of all this. And you're like, I have to be a grownup. And like, 
[P158]  kids still need food do this yeah i mean oh oh so terrible okay um so yes i think you know your gut on starting to kind of just like put the baby steps in place that plan i think is is a good one um again i would i would take you know find the life insurance i would get as much concrete uh information as you can because that's going to help you guys navigate this but for him 
[P159]  I mean, to get him to live on 70K and be comfortable there probably will mean offloading some of this debt so that they don't have all these payments. And I would have him look through every account possible to see if there's any savings. And I would probably start working on paying off maybe these smaller debts if they do have credit card debt. And sell her a car and get rid of that loan. 
[P160]  That's a short-term thing that could relieve some pressure here. If there are credit cards only in her name? Yeah, if they're only in her name, he may not be liable for them. It just depends on how things are set up and will the estate pay it out of her assets and his name on that. I can't tell you for sure. If her name's on the mortgage, technically they can come after those things. They're not going to go after the mortgage or her retirement accounts, but if she has any other assets that can be used to pay this down, they will use that. 
[P161]  but I would not be in a rush to pay off this credit card debt. And I would not let the creditors pressure him and lie to him and say, no, you need to pay this today. Do send a copy of the death certificate to the credit card companies. Once you get those, get a bunch of copies, probably 10 copies minimum to send to all the creditors involved. So these credit cards are in just some, some of them are just in her name. Is that what you're saying, Morgan? I think they might be. I think a handful might be. And I would pull her credit report and his just to verify and make sure that, 
[P162]  Yeah, that that information is correct. Get a lay of the land. And you can do that for free. You can have them go to this website, annualcreditreport.com, I believe is the site. And you can pull and don't ever pay to get this pulled. Perfect. Yep, there it is, annualcreditreport.com. You can pull from all three bureaus and get a real picture of here's the reality of where we're at and now we know the next steps. And he's lucky to have you to help and clean up the pieces. And if we can help in any other way, let us know. But this is just one of those reminders 
[P163]  to everyone else listening, get a will in place today. It's not going to cause you to die any sooner, but it will cause your family to just grieve your loss instead of also lead you on a scavenger hunt and guess. Yeah. And have the government decide what happens to your stuff. May I address your listeners for just one minute? Please. Excuse me for getting emotional. Get this done, guys. Because instead of just being able to grieve, take three months off work, 
[P164]  it's off work, take the children on a trip. He's in a financial mess. So on top of grief, there's headache, frustration, and stress. So please, this stuff happens every day. I know, excuse me, none of us think it's going to happen to us until it does. So if anything, just get enough life insurance to cover these things while you clean them to babysit. Well said, Morgan. Thank you so much for 
[P165]  It's not easy to go on radio like this and share. I'm so sorry. Everyone listening, including us, we're thinking of them and praying for them and wishing them the best. And just to continue on what Morgan's saying, we believe in this so much, you guys, to get your wills done. Xander Insurance for life insurance. Get 10 to 12 times your annual income. If you're a stay-at-home mom, you need half a million at least on you. Get life insurance today. Morgan, we're praying for you guys. George, thanks for the hour. Thanks to everyone in the booth that's making it happen. 
[P166]  We'll be back.

主题：学生贷款 refinancing 方案

输入内容：
[P82]  Warshaw. Listen, I get it. The student loan situation is bananas, but it's time to make progress, not excuses. So if your payment and interest rate have you treading water, refinancing could be the solution for you. Look, if I were in your shoes, I would contact Laurel Road today and get a free 30 minute consultation. You'll work with a student loan expert and you'll go over your refinancing options. Hey, for refinancing to make sense, you've got to check certain boxes like making a good income. And bottom line, 
[P83]  Ramsey's advice is that you only refinance if you can get a lower rate or a shorter term. Remember, the point is to pay off debt faster. Maybe you just need to keep rocking the debt snowball. But if refinancing does make sense for you, Laurel Road offers low competitive rates and interest rate discounts are available for stuff like auto pay. Listen, you can't mess around with student loans. If you want them gone, you got to go hard. So go to laurelroad.com slash Ramsey to find out more and schedule your free 30 minute consultation.

[P61]  I used to be one of those guys. I didn't even think about it. And one of my buddies said, hey, the only reason to not have life insurance is if you hate your wife and kids. And I immediately went and got term life insurance. That's a gut punch. For decades, Dave, I've sat across people who've lost a spouse. They've lost somebody important to them. Me too. They don't know what to do next. You're going to have a crisis here. You know, you got two options while you're sitting and talking to a young widow. She's concerned about how she's going to invest all this money properly and not mess this up. Or she's concerned how she's going to eat tomorrow. That's exactly right. These are the two options. 
[P62]  saying I love you to your family, term life insurance. Jeff Zander and the team at Zander Insurance makes it easy and affordable. I've used them personally for 25 years. They're the only people I trust. Go to Zander.com or call 800-356-4282. The Employee Benefit Research Institute recently did a study asking people really have a million, asking how many people really have a million dollars saved for retirement. And according to the research, 
[P63]  3.2% of Americans have a million dollars or more in their tax advantage accounts like a 401k or an individual retirement account and IRA. 58% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved in their retirement.

And then the comparisons. Can I just be honest? It's the women on women comparisons of, oh, let me see the ring. Oh, that's cute. You know what I mean? Like the guys don't care. No man has ever cared. No. It's just like we don't want the woman to be upset. 
[P144]  No, it's from the lab and not a blood diamond. Oh, yeah. What do you think about? Yeah. I could give a rat's toot about where. Like, if that's what you're basing this marriage on. Well, was it? Did they work hard for the diamond or did a laboratory? Don't care. Get a moisonite. It's about the beauty of the ring. And does it match her personality? And does it make sense financially? Because that is an industry that you can spend so much on. My wife's ring was not that expensive. There you go. It's not a blood diamond. I'm not even sure it's a real diamond, Rachel.

[P43]  or the link down below if you're listening on YouTube or podcast. All right, George, we had a Smart Money Happy Hour episode. You know, we have some that just, you can tell, have hit a nerve with the world in a good way. And we did one recently on things that scream, I'm pretending to be upper class. Because living a higher lifestyle than maybe what you can afford keeps you broke. I mean, when you are living beyond your means and trying to, in a way, kind of keep up with what everyone else 
[P44]  is doing will constantly lead you back to this idea of spending money that you don't need to spend. And sometimes you're spending money you don't even have to keep up this lifestyle. And you talk about comparisons a lot. So this segment hopefully will help you fight those comparisons and FOMO you feel amongst your friends. So here's some signs, some things that your friends may be doing people out there on Instagram that may show they're faking their upper class status. Number one, flashy designer logos. This is a big one. Most luxury items like a cashmere sweater never 
[P45]  have logos all over them. We've talked about stealth wealth. Yes. It's a new trend. It's called quiet luxury, stealth wealth. People that are actually really wealthy, you won't really know it. They don't really have all the flashy stuff that you just look at and you know exactly, oh, that hat, that jacket, those shoes, like you know exactly where everything's from. A lot kind of go under the radar. If you know, you know. If you know, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Secret society. Yeah, it's kind of that. That's like the new vibe, which is great. I think it's great. So yeah, that's number one. Number two is ordering 
[P46]  of wine when everyone knows that you're on a beer budget. Ooh. Hey, some of these beers now are crazy expensive. But yes, the wine does... That one feels like a ripoff to me personally. You know this, my stance. I do know this. I will not order wine at a restaurant. But if someone else buys a bottle, hey, I'm happy to share. Oh, I'm sure you are. I'll chip in. Take a glass from someone. Glasses of wine and cocktails can go for $20 a pop versus a beer. Or even better, just a water. What happened to just drinking water with a meal? Why do we got to add more 
[P47]  calories to the mix. And more money. And more money. See, that's not fun though. I do like an appetizer. I'll just have a water. Rachel's like, I'll have three appetizers and let's try a bunch of... I do. I love going out to eat. Rachel lives a little. I do. Number three is talking about money too much. So it's like, oh, I'm leveraging this debt for all this real estate. I think those are like some of the funniest Instagram reels that come up on my feed sometimes where people are like, I'm six 
[P48]  million dollars in debt and we are loving it and it's like showing all their vrbo's that they've bought in debt and all this stuff and you're just like no no it's exhausting and then you've got the crypto bros who are very loud right now because crypto is worth 14 billion dollars you know for the moment and so all these people talking loudly about money is usually a red flag to me maybe they don't actually have a lot yep uh next is flaunting wealth on social media 
[P49]  interesting one because I do think you can like use vacations for an example. You could see somebody at the same destination on social media, but the way they present themselves again, kind of back to that self wealth of like, Oh yeah, we're just like, maybe I'm showing you some of the stuff, but it's more of what we're doing or like, you know, the kids and the poor, I don't know, whatever. And then there's those that are like, Oh no, I'm going to take you around the suite that we have rented for the week, you know, or, uh, you know, we're going to, it, 
[P50]  It just feels like I want to show you this amazing life that I live. And then the kicker, they're like, and by the way, it was totally free with their credit card points. Sign up for my course if you want to. I'm like, oh my gosh, get out of here. It's true. It's true. Get out of town. Here's another one. Leasing luxury cars. Oh, yes. If you're a dude and you've ever posed in front of any vehicle, it's a hard no for me. Your dad didn't hug you enough and I'm sorry. That's just the truth. 
[P51]  That's usually draining their wallet. We just took a call earlier. It is. Guy's got a $1,200 car payment. Yeah. He may look like he's driving great when you see him, but behind the scenes, not doing so well. And leasing cars. You know the number one city? I read this somewhere, so don't. I don't want everyone in Dallas to hate me. Number one city? Of leased cars? Dallas. Dallas, Texas. That makes sense. Number one. A lot of young bros who are doing well for themselves. I guess. Got those Beamer. You know, and you're always leasing like a Beamer Mercedes. It's always like a. 
[P52]  It's a nice car. Where are the guys who are leasing the Honda Civic? They're not there. Does that exist? No, I don't think so. I don't think they make money off that, George. Okay. And then number six, over-accessorizing, flashy nails, expensive watches, loud hair, or loud hair slash makeup. That's what's on there. I don't know, just a lot. Yeah, and this, you know, obviously the watches leans more the dudes, but the women, the flashy nails, the loud hair and makeup, we could tone it down, you know? I know, but here's my thing. I'm all for accessorizing. 
[P53]  There's a limit. I know. Here's my thing with this, though, is, I mean, I do that. I get my nails done. Well, you follow a lot of, like, the influencer moms, and some of them are very sweet and authentic and being themselves, and then some fall into the category of this is a lot. Yeah. You're trying to portray a certain life. I would agree with that. Like, they wake up and they have full makeup. Who's believing this? This isn't real. This isn't real. So, yeah. So, all of these things, you know, can, again, scream, I'm pretending to be upper class. So, here's the thing, you guys. 
[P54]  taking upper class, how do we get there and be wise? Because again, none of these things in and of themselves, I wouldn't say, right? If you like order wine at dinner, if you do have a nice designer person, none of these things in and of themselves are bad. But when it becomes your whole persona and it's the only thing you're shooting for in life, and again, that you will put yourself in a financial position that's not wise in order to achieve these things, like that's where the caution flight, the caution lights come on. And if you're doing it with debt, it is a facade. It is a house of cards. You're artificially propping this up. 
[P55]  you can tweet this if you're listening out there whatever it is called whatever platform you're on whatever free speech platform you choose here it is Rachel you ready for this can't wait if you live fake rich you'll become real broke eventually you will be calling the show and life was great and now something happened and you're going I'm in a real pickle because of my financial decisions yes and so we just don't want that for you yep let it be real and yeah doing things again doing a budget living within your means saving up for an emergency fund getting out of debt 
[P56]  So you free up payments so that you can actually use your money to give, to invest, to buy a house that's actually, you know, reasonable for your income. You know, you're doing all these things. And again, they're not, it's not going to be like this flashy, beautiful, wonderful lifestyle 24 seven. It's not going to look like that, but there's going to be the steadiness and this like firmness of a foundation under you. And it's not all just like shaky and built on other people's money. That's right. Normalize the 10 year old used minivan. That's practical. 
[P57]  four car that's the real flex okay so let yeah so the minivan and everyone knows i love my we know your feelings about minivans yes i do love i love my minivan i think it's great it is wonderful but i will say the plastic on the side of the seats have popped off so two now are so when you get in my van there's like wires and have your kids been vandalizing this vehicle i feel like that's a personal problem i don't think that's on honda you know what i mean we can't blame the good people at honda for i know but i'm like oh my 
[P58]  gosh this like yeah i'm blaming chuck cruise he's been working out too much just ripping pieces of this van apart oh but it's you know but it's paid for that's what matters that's what's great stressful you know what i hit my garage the other day big old scrape on my car you know what i said yeah it's 12 years old it's fine who am i trying to impress rachel cruise she's not impressed what am i trying to do here so yeah there's a big old scrape on my car so good because i hit my garage all right if you are watching on 
[P59]  to comment below because we want to know some of your, you know, things that you see out and you're like, huh, are these people trying to, trying to be upper class and they're not, you know, share your stories, the lifestyle that's out there. And I would say a good bit of it's probably on social media. Can we be honest with that? It helps to just get off of there. I realized I stopped caring what other people think when I'm not looking for reasons to be angry and upset and jealous and envious. Just get off and live your life. George, if we could all be as well.

主题：Lee财务状况与决策建议

输入内容：
[P64]  And click the link titled, Are You On Track With The Baby Steps? And complete the quiz for free. All right, let's go to the phones and let's talk to Lee in San Antonio. Hi, Lee. Welcome to the show. Hi, how are you all today? We're doing great. How can we help? So I have a question. I just got turned on to your show about a month ago and I've become an addict. I kind of learned about the baby steps several years ago from a friend of mine. 
[P65]  So just this week, I paid off my vehicle. I paid off all my personal loan except for my house. Did you have all this money sitting around and you just weren't willing to part with it? Yeah, kind of. I paid off all the credit card student loan. I took a lot of extra gigs as a contract nurse and stuff. Awesome. That's a big step. You drank the Kool-Aid. Way to go. I did. I did. So my question. I am married. We've been married for 30 years. 
[P66]  years. My husband is terrible with money. He has almost put us in the poor house three times. So about when I got turned on to this a couple of years ago, I've separated our finances completely because, you know, you give him a debit card, he has money. If he had checks, he had money. So we have never agreed on money. He doesn't make as much as I do, but he is definitely not hurting as far as his credit sucks. He can't go anywhere. Sorry for the word. 
[P67]  We've heard worse today. 
[P68]  he has to pay it because that was his mistake. He didn't say anything about it. He didn't report it. And now he gets to pay it. So going back a couple of weeks, I was listening to your show. And I know I heard you all talk about the Bitcoin and I'll sell it, whatever. But I do remember him mentioning something, and I haven't been able to find the show about if you had stock, like single stock. So when I worked in the hospital, I used to buy stock from them, and it wasn't much. But when I checked on it the other day, 
[P69]  Oh, wow. 
[P70]  $25,000. The tax bill is how much in your husband's name? Nine grand. Nine grand. That's not both our names, but it was his mistake because he took the money out of his 401k and got the taxes and penalties and all that. Yep. What did he use that money for? He didn't report it. I was gone. You have no idea what he spent it on? Does he have an addiction? He's frivolous. He likes to cook. He likes to buy junk. People don't rob their 401k to buy junk. 
[P71]  I cut him off from myself, like I said. He buys junk, believe me. He likes clothes. He likes junk. He does. Okay, so what's the total debt? Is it just the $9,000, or is there more where this came from? Well, his that I know of, that I'm on, is the $9,000. He did not tell me how much he has put into that thing. Those are his credit cards, whatever. He is not on mine. The house is in my name. My car is in my name. Everything is in my name. 
[P72]  Okay. So from a practical standpoint, Lee, I would probably pay it off because it's in your name. I mean, it's, yeah, for you guys, which sucks that it's his mistake. And I say sucks that it's his mistake because of the way you guys have been living. Yeah. So I would do that. I would, do you have money saved? Or are you on baby step one? My net worth, no, my net worth, I already have, I have my $1,000 in a separate account. I have paid all my accounts off. 
[P73]  My net worth with all my IRAs and investments, because I put money in investments when I was doing the COVID thing also and paying off loans and all. So my net worth, according to my Quicken account or whatever that is, or whatever was on my computer, because I'm not a really good money savvy person, is about $670,000. Way to go. That's great. My house only owes, I only owe $172,000 on my house right now. Okay. Okay. But you've been doing the solo, essentially. You're just like, whatever. 
[P74]  do you i'm gonna manage my money and not go into debt and get my goals and yes you're not dragging me down so the question to if you sell and the stock is in what again um it's in a hospital stock in a big uh corporate okay okay okay um yeah i mean i bought it years ago it was only like you know from payroll deduction and i've just kind of like left it on the back burner sure yeah and it's grown it was like 25 50 50 bucks when i bought it and now it's worth like 300 i mean it's 35 000 
[P75]  That's what I found out. That's amazing. So you'll probably, what's your, do you file single or married filing jointly at this point? Oh, we still do married filing jointly just because it's cheaper that way. And what was your income last year? Last year was 94, but this year I got it up and it's 97. Okay. So it'll likely fall into like a 15% capital gains tax on those stocks since you've owned them for longer than a year. It's going to be long-term capital gains tax and it'll likely be 15%. 
[P76]  I would talk to your tax pro about what that number actually would turn into because you'll need to have that, you know, be able to pay the taxes on that come tax time. But I would definitely sell these stocks, pay off that $9,000, and then fully fund your emergency fund. And then be putting the rest in your Roth 401k, or I'm sorry, your Roth IRA that you were saying, and just be putting... Well, because I just found out yesterday when I called my HR benefits and stuff, we do have Roth IRAs available here at my job. 
[P77]  I have just 401k. I'm sorry. Yes. Right. Okay. So that and your Roth IRA are going to be your friends because the great thing is when you take the money out, like versus this stock where you're having to pay capital gains, you wouldn't pay anything and you could just cash it out and it would be all $35,000 of yours. The only difference is you won't get the tax deduction come tax time because it's on the Roth side. Yeah, that's right. But that's worth it because of how much you're going to be making in interest over time. So I would do that. And then Lee, I mean, that's the... 
[P78]  If I sell it, I get it before I file my income taxes, put that into the $7,000 into my IRA for last year's, and then I could worry about the taxes on the long-term capital gains for this year. Yeah. I mean, that's one way to do it. Before tax time, you can fund last year's Roth IRA and HSA and all that stuff. So that would be a good thing to do. And then make sure you have your fully funded emergency fund set up before that. And if you have enough, you can fund the rest in that. 
[P79]  IRA. But the bigger glaring issue here is this marriage, Lee. It's like the elephant in the room. How long have you guys been married? Well, 30 years. So I did talk to an attorney and basically he was like, it's cheaper to keep him. Because you're going to have to split your assets and all that. I also want to think about the quality of your life and not just about the dollar signs, but I just feel for you. 
[P80]  Has it been 30 years of this? I mean, the way he handles money and the way he approaches money is the same as how he approaches life, correct? Yes. I mean, he's very, I mean, he's not a, I don't even know how to say it. He's an oxymoron on his whole world. I mean, he's, so the kids need him for something. He's there. He's never been not there. Yeah. He did have an infidelity issue years ago. I don't think that's a problem. It hasn't been a problem anymore, but. Okay. Well, 
[P81]  I would say this, Lee, too. Just for the wholeness of who you are as a person, what George is saying is, you know, making sure that you're a whole person and how you can do that best, you know, is your decision for sure. But I would keep my money separate at this point because he's not proven otherwise and I don't trust him. So I hope that helps, Lee. And good luck to you. Well done on all the progress. Thanks to all the guys in the booth. And Kelly, the lady in there. Oh, yeah. Taylor, we have some ladies in the booth. And you, George, is a great co-host. This is The Ramsey Show.

[P127]  yrefy.com slash Ramsey. That's the letter Y, R-E-F-Y.com slash Ramsey may not be available in all states. Today's question comes from Matthew in Idaho. My wife and I are millionaires after years of working through the baby steps. In the beginning, it was exciting. The baby steps happened fast and our children learned to have Christmas on a budget. But once we got to the point where we had an emergency fund, the house was paid off and we were building wealth, everything just started to seem very routine and boring. 
[P128]  going in our financial lives. If there was ever a Rachel Cruz question, this would be it. You were made for this question. George. You were so good about keeping your financial life excited. Yeah. Because you're the spender. You're like, I've got some ideas. Yeah. And they're like, he's like me. He's like, well, I like a financial goal. We saved the thing. We invested the thing. But now what? Goals. Now you have to actually figure out like who you are. I'm kidding. Find hobbies. That's right. Okay. So I always go back to this because it's 
[P129]  so spot on and I agree with it a hundred percent and it's science but Arthur Brooks talks about what you can do with money five things and four bring happiness and one does not so this is what I would say to him to Matthew you can give which brings happiness you can save which actually brings happiness because it shows progress you can buy experiences with people you love and that brings happiness you can buy your time back and then use your time well spent right so if you have someone mow your lawn 
[P130]  I'll mow the lawn, but you get time back, but go work out or like go do something productive. And then number five, you can spend money on stuff, but that does not produce joy. And then Ray MC, we always talk about, you can give, save and spend, right? So kind of using that framework, if I were you, Mike, I mean, if there isn't a big goal out there, and I would say Winston and I, we've kind of gotten to this place. Our house was a massive goal. That was in 2019. And then we made it a goal for a pool and we actually were finished. We're done now, I know. So what we took, 
[P131]  I guess probably five years to save for that. And so now we're at this point when we were planning our 2025 of like, okay, we don't really have a big financial goal in place. And I would say that for a time period, I think that's okay because we shifted the excitement and like, hey, what's the next thing to some of those things Arthur Brooks talks about? So like plan a fun trip with your family, like have some experiences with them. Give someone a trip, right? If you have the money, like are there people in your life that you could bless them of like, oh gosh, 
[P132]  couple really helped us walk through some hard times and we want to give them a weekend away right and like like what are things you can do and then the giving aspect which once and I even changed some of our giving goals this year um and we are we like have a percentage now in our every dollar budget that is above our tithe above everything else we do and it's spontaneous giving and we're going to force ourselves every month to do it and to say yeah well like where can we give spontaneously to someone throughout the month if we hear a story if we experience someone you know at a 
[P133]  restaurant, a waiter or waitress, like give an insane tip. Like what are ways we can do that? And that fueled my excitement, George. Like when we planned all this out a few weeks ago, as we were kind of talking through the year, it was like, okay, we don't have a big goal, quote unquote, we're saving for. There's no baby step eight. Yeah, yeah. But we're being more creative with our giving, which does make it more exciting. We are going to travel some this year. So we put that in the budget. So yeah, so like leaning in on these things that actually will bring you joy. And I'll probably, you know, buy some shirts from Abercrombie, you know, it's just what I do. 
[P134]  But overall, where do we put our time and our energy and our money? Put it in the stuff that's going to bring you joy and excitement. And for me, that's giving and experiences. But that's probably just my personality. No, you nailed it. I think there's usually a flat tire situation when you're really good at saving and investing. And then the giving side usually is a little lackluster. And you have a hard time just spending for fun because it feels frivolous after everything you've been through. Are you speaking out of your experience, George? This is me. This is me. I'm working on my flat tire, Rachel. 
[P135]  a little more. But I relate to Matthew's situation because the baby steps are so great because it gives you a very exact process. If you do this thing, you'll hit this goal. And then you get to baby step seven and it's a choose your own adventure of live and give like no one else. Yes. Yeah. And so that's where he has to figure that out for himself. And maybe that is, we need to find some hobbies. Maybe I'm going to try golfing or I want to get back into this thing that I used to love as a child. And I really need to pick back up piano lessons. Yes. Whatever the thing is for you and your family, 
[P136]  and go, hey, this is something we never thought we would do. Or back in the day, we were like, nope, we can't do that. What can you say yes to now that was a no five years ago? Yes, that's good. That's really good. Make that list. Yeah, of what are things that we, yeah, what should we do? And you got, you and Winston just did your annual dream date recently. Yes, that's what I was talking about. Yeah, and we had the, we had every dollar for our monthly budget up and then we had Excel and Winston has all these crazy formulas of like implementing taxes. I don't know, he has all this like, he does it all. I got to get that spreadsheet. 
[P137]  from Winston. I need some new formulas in my life. Yeah. And that's the interesting thing is people really do, you know, on the show we talk about, you know, for a lot of listeners and for those of you that are new to the baby steps, a lot of people are starting out on baby step one. They're just trying to get that thousand dollars and pay off debt, right? But this, this long journey of money, I always want you guys to hear from us on this show that the goal of building wealth and being in a really secure place in baby step seven, where you don't even have a house payment, your house is paid for, retirement's being funded, like all of that. 
[P138]  It's not just to continue just to get more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more, right? There is an outflow that needs to happen. You need to do things with your family, give to others, give others great experiences in life. Like there is something about using money as a tool. It's not something to hoard and to keep, but you're doing this to leave a mark on the world. I mean, there's something beautiful about that that I think is really innate and how we're created. And so leaning into some of that, because I do think there can be this mindset, 
[P139]  on, you know, maybe Baby Steps like four, five, six, where there's like, my goal is just to like, get money, get money, get money, get money, which right, you're funding retirement, you're wanting stability. But there's been listeners here that have been with us for eight, nine, 10 plus years that are Baby Steps millionaires. And they're like, yeah, and they're on the other side. And the ones we talked to that have this joy about them, this countenance about them that we meet, it's because they've been able to do some cool stuff. And every now and then they'll drop their story to us, you know, the things they get to do. But I don't know, 
[P140]  There's something about this whole idea of building wealth. It's not just to build wealth. It is what you do with that wealth that brings you a level of joy and happiness and how we're created. Beautifully said, Rachel. Gosh, no notes. No notes. No notes. So Matthew, spend some money. Go on a great trip and be a generous giver. Go find things that bring you joy with giving because that's the best. All right, George, there are some social questions

主题：Mike家庭财务危机应对

输入内容：
[P105]  Welcome back to the Ramsey Show. Up next, we have Ethan. Oh, we have Mike. Sorry, Mike in Asheville, North Carolina. Hi, Mike. Welcome to the show. Hey, how are y'all doing? I got a good one for you. Okay, perfect. 
[P106]  We did a big remodel. It was about $100,000 that we've invested to create home offices. As a result, we kind of credit carded everything, and we've been living paycheck to paycheck for a while, and I just lost my job this week. We were trying to do a refinance, and that fell through. And so long story short, we went from about $195K in income to about $65K and looking for advice. 
[P107]  We're not allowed to sell it for at least a year. And the remodel is not quite finished. Oh, boy. Okay. Is that more than just getting the two home offices during COVID? Y'all done more remodeling? Yeah, it was extensive. We kind of expanded the second floor and just with the goal of ultimately selling. But it's obviously when I lost my job, it was kind of a deal where it kind of put the brakes on everything even more. 
[P108]  and paycheck to paycheck. And so we're obviously doing it the wrong way. So looking for advice on how to get out of this. How much more debt do you have? What's the total amount? And break it down for us. Okay, so the mortgage is $202,000. And we have things like cars and credit cards. And a lot of that is just due to the remodel. But it's $210,000 and other non-mortgage debt. Oh, my goodness. Well, we can sell the cars. 
[P109]  what do the cars have to do with the remodel? They don't. Yeah, so the cars we're paying, one of them is $394, the other one is $380 a month. How much do you owe on the cars? How much debt's on them? Yeah, approximately $28 in total. Okay, break them down. What's each one? Well, one of them is about $13,500, the other one's $15. Okay. 
[P110]  I'm confused. You said you had $210,000 in other debt and only $28,000 of that as cars. You're saying the rest of that is credit card debt? Well, unfortunately, we had like a foundation loan. A bunch of it's credit card. I have a student loan at about $20,000. And I think, yes, the rest of it is either small loans like through Home Depot or credit cards, correct. And what were you doing for work where you guys were making about $200,000? 
[P111]  Software developer. Okay, and what are you doing now? I am looking for work, but I'm going to work on some certifications. I took a job that wasn't ideal for obviously my career and skill set, and so that's something I'm going to be working on is some probably Azure certifications. Are they going to cost money? A little. The test, the actual certification exam is only $165. But then you need to, is there some kind of online? 
[P112]  education you need to get that will cost money? Or can you just do the certification test? I can. There are some sample tests and some certification videos that are very helpful, but it's minimal charges, if any. And how quickly do you think you could get a job making six figures as a software developer? Well, I've applied for a bunch of jobs already, but it's a matter of finding the right fit. I would like 
[P113]  to focus on the skill set to some extent, but probably in two weeks, I would be able to pass that certification. Okay. If I was in your shoes, Mike, right fit would be a luxury and a privilege. Right now, I'm going, who is willing to pay me $100,000 to write some code? And I'm going to do that so I can survive. Because right now, I don't see a way out of this with your monthly payments and your income. You guys are going to continually go into debt. Is your wife working, Mike? Yes. Okay. Is she making the 65? 
[P114]  Yes. Okay, so if you made 100, then you guys could get back up to 165. Yeah, well, I was at 130, but yes. Okay, yeah. So, I mean, ideally replacing that completely like what you're saying. And then, yeah, I mean, and then from there, Mike, it's just a complete overhaul and mindset shift and change on how you guys have been viewing money. And you said it at the beginning of the call, so I'm not telling you anything you don't know, 
[P115]  been doing it, it has to be the complete opposite. So this is cutting up credit cards. This is, I mean, if any of your cars have equity in them, I would just sell them and get a $5,000 car. I mean, I would do the complete opposite of everything I've been doing up until this point because that's where you're actually going to start to see some progress. And I really feel like, Mike, you guys need some quick wins in here. Yes, the income is number one. But I would be cutting up credit cards tonight. I mean, no more. No more. 
[P116]  Like you guys are not in a place to even have them around because so much of this is credit card debts. And I know it was all in, you know, because of the remodel, but the whole mindset, yeah, of going in when you don't have the money, it just, that can't be it anymore. And then, you know, walking through the debt snowball of paying off and breaking all these out too. So when you say, yeah, some of these are credit cards, breaking each specific credit card out. So you guys may have a long list of debts, 
[P117]  knocking these out that's where that momentum starts are you guys able to stay current on payments right now well we had a small severance um but it was only five thousand dollars and so um our current just our debt load is like a little over sixty two hundred dollars for the month and so um the money we've got you know in hand will you know in my last a month yeah i mean you guys are you're on the edge of 
[P118]  running out and going back into more debt. And so can you go do three side jobs this week? Yes. It doesn't have to be software. It could be Instacart, Shipt, Uber, Handyman, whatever skills you have, go do it to bring in something while you look for that work. I had one job where I picked up some work to do some light remodeling for a lady, and that was $530. 
[P119]  You're pretty handy. I've collected about half of that. Yeah. I mean, I'm doing the remodel myself. So yeah. Okay. Well, today we start Mike's handyman business and you're going to charge 50, 60, 70 bucks an hour and put it on your neighborhood Facebook group and hand out some flyers and go, I'm doing good work and I show up on time and get referrals, word of mouth and get this business going and do as much of it as you can until you get that next software developer job. Okay. That's what I would be doing if I had your skillset. Yeah. And I think what's hard, 
[P120]  Mike, is there's a level of like deep humility that you're going to have to have in this process because between now and getting your new job, making anything and doing work that maybe you never thought you would be doing is what's necessary right now, right? Because I don't want you guys, like what George was saying, to get behind. So bringing in a thousand, two thousand, three thousand a month on numerous things that you're pairing together and you're working late. I mean, do you guys have kids at home? Yes, two. How old are they? 
[P121]  Yeah, so 14 and 17. Okay. Do they know about any of this? I'm sorry? Do they know about your financial situation at all? To some extent, yes, high level. Okay. It might be good to sit down with them and have a hard conversation and say, listen, the next year or two, it's going to look different for our family. We used to go do stuff and eat out and do all these sports, and right now we've got to really tighten up and get out of this financial mess. 
[P122]  like yeah and even if your wife can work overtime mike too um i mean i would be doing that i mean again income is going to be your best bet and then cutting lifestyle which we're just saying and it's going to be um yeah i mean i mean if you guys if you get back up to that 195 i would be living like i made 80 because the 65 000 is covering the bills basically per month right i mean i mean living on seriously on nothing and that's you could you could really turn this around if you could throw 
[P123]  which sounds wild, wild numbers here. But if you could throw a hundred grand a year out of that non-mortgage debt in two years. Yeah. I mean, seriously. I mean, there's, there's some big changes you can, yeah. Selling the cars, getting rid of what you can, selling stuff to my go around your house, sell all the crap you guys that, you know, that you have doing what you can. But if you hold on the line, Taylor's going to pick up and we're going to give you financial peace university. It's our nine lesson course and you and your wife sit down together and even your kids and watch this. You guys binge that this weekend because, um,

主题：Tammy房产与债务困境

输入内容：
[P23]  Milwaukee. Hey, Tammy, welcome to the show. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Absolutely. I am 34 and I have had a couple of houses. I went through a nasty divorce a couple of years ago, bought a house, sold it and bought this one. And this is where I'm in a little bit of trouble. I bought this house debt free. So I had a paid off car. 
[P24]  put 20% down. So I thought it was in good shape. Yeah. Until one thing after another kind of broke and I was fixing things. And now that I've been watching you guys for the last six months, I know that I should not have taken this large of a mortgage because it's about half of my income. Of your take-home pay? Yes. Oh. So what do you make and what's the mortgage? Sure. 
[P25]  I have a few jobs now. So my first income is about $4,000 a month. That's my primary job. And I see that keep going up and I'm trying to get promotions and doing well. And then I also bartend on the side. So that helps. And then I'm about to start doing taxes on the side. So coming up here, hopefully. Okay. How much do you make bartending? 
[P26]  a month, would you say? About $400, $500. I try to be conservative with that number. A month? Okay. Yeah. Okay, perfect. And what's your mortgage payment every month? $2,000. All right. Got it. Okay, so how can we best help you today? I'm wondering if I should sell my house because it is a lot. Yeah. Or if I just keep hustling because what it 
[P27]  it did was it put me into debt. Um, I was also paying for school and I made the mistake of putting that on my credit card. Um, how much other debt do you have? 37,000. Okay. Is that all credit card? Um, one is a personal loan and the arrested credit card. Okay. Um, I mean, yes, Tammy, the only reason I would say and kind of get to that answer pretty quickly with the house, 
[P28]  is that you would have to basically double your income for this to make sense. And you are saying that you see your income going up. But what I would want is the side hustle income not be part of the equation for your mortgage because I want to get you to a point in your financial journey that you're not having to have a side hustle to keep your mortgage, right? It's not sustainable. Yeah, you want just like your regular income to be able to support your main four walls and more. 
[P29]  long have you been in the house um i just hit two years uh last summer so i'm good on the capital gain side yeah okay how um how much do you owe on it what could you sell it for um i owe 275 uh and i think i could probably get 410 410 yeah oh wow it went up a lot in two years 
[P30]  Okay. So I'm more in the suburbs. Yeah. But it definitely did, and I put a lot down, and I think that might have been another. Yeah, that's true. That's fair. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fair. So if you sold it after fees, you would net probably $110,000 or so, maybe $120,000 if you're lucky? Yeah, I kind of assumed it would be around that $100,000 just because of real estate. Okay. And then you could then pay off your $37,000 in debt, leaving you with another $60,000 plus to then begin a new down payment fund while you rent. 
[P31]  kids Tammy when you divorced or is or no kids no okay so it's just you okay just me and a dog okay no that's great so yeah I mean honestly Tammy you know our goal when at least when I'm giving this advice and George would be the same is it's ultimately leading you to have a level of control over your money that ultimately then gives you peace that's what we want right I mean if you build wealth and do all of this that's later in the baby steps and that is so doable for people but the biggest component here is peace and Tammy I don't feel like you have a lot of peace when have your 
[P32]  is going to just the mortgage and you have $37,000 of other debt that you're having to pay and you're having to keep up the house. I mean, there's just not, it doesn't sound like a lot of peace. Would that be true? Yeah. I mean, I've paid off like $5,000 in the last six months ever since falling your baby steps. Oh, great. Which is great. But I don't know if it's enough. Right, right. And I don't want to work 80 hours a week. Yes, totally, totally. At that pace, it's going to take you another 40 months to get rid of the debt you took on. 
[P33]  on top of covering your mortgage, which is already consuming a lot of your take-home pay. So I can feel the stress of all of that making things worse. Yeah, so I think a good goal to shoot for, Tammy, is I probably would. I would sell the house. I would use some of that money to pay off your debts. I would use some of it for an emergency fund. And then I would quickly get back into a house or into real estate in general. Because I think you can put yourself in a position where you're not a renter forever. But it may even look like a townhome or a condo 
[P34]  something, right? It may not be even a single family home, or if it is, it's smaller and it's way more doable. Cause I do think, you know, prices with homes, they continue to go up. So I don't want people on the sideline for too long. But a move like this, I think will open up so much margin for you. And you'll be able to have kind of a clear head to go and purchase something again. Cause I do think you'll be in a position soon to buy something. Yeah. It's not quitting on home ownership. It's just getting your head above water to do it with a 
[P35]  feels like. I mean, you can give it six months and see if you can get your income way up, like Rachel said, before you sell. It's not like an on-fire sell today, but it just feels like if there's no end in sight where this is going to get easier and you're going to continue to go into debt, then I think the writing's on the wall that it's wise to sell. Yeah. And then I'll follow your plan of 25% of my income. That would be nice. That's right. That's right. It's not a fundamentally, you got to do 20. It's just that when it's 50%, life is hard. When it's 25%, 
[P36]  Yeah, I mean, if it was $1,000 right now, right, compared to your income, that changes. I mean, that's $1,000 freed up right there. And if you, you know, work hard and bartend and maybe do double what you're doing, that's $2,000 coming in extra a month to pay off this other debt, right? It just kind of ends up working so much more in your favor in that way. Is there a growth plan for you to make five, six, seven grand a month in your current role? That's complicated. 
[P37]  So I'm not sure. Is it time to look for another company? I have started looking. I'm a loyalist, so we'll see. But maybe it is time. Maybe I need to dig into that further. I mean, for your skill sets, would you say you could ROI better out in somewhere else and you're staying because you love this company? Or do you think, no, like I'm worth this amount, even if I transferred to another company? No, I just graduated. 
[P38]  Okay. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, Tammy, it feels like there's some big moves coming up in the future, which is all positive, though. That's it. I'm like, it's freeing you up more and more, giving you more peace and control. And I think it's going to be an incredible thing. I really do. Yeah, renting is not a waste of money if it's going to buy you peace. That's right. For a period of time, for sure. And then you can save up for a down payment on your next property, and you can just keep that ball rolling. Thanks for the call, Tammy. This is The Ramsey Show.

主题：Alex债务问题咨询

输入内容：
[P2]  your life, relationships, anything and everything. We're going to start off this hour with Alex in Cleveland, Ohio. Hi, Alex. Welcome to the show. Hi, thanks. How are you guys doing today? We're doing great. How can we help? So I am 23 years old. I roughly have about $90,000 in debt. 
[P3]  Okay. 
[P4]  student loans and $6,000 on credit cards. I did complete baby step number one, working on number two. My mom also mentioned that she thinks I should file for bankruptcy. I'm not sure if that's the best solution, but I just wanted to get your guys' thought on that. No, on the bankruptcy. I'll just say that. Yeah, first and foremost. We're not there. We're not even close. So there's some good news for you. I think mom wants you to get a clean slate 
[P5]  She's kind of wanting you to just shortcut this and be free from the pain. But there's better options here. And so let's talk about the car. Instead of a voluntary repo, could you sell it and come up with the amount you're underwater on? The car is only worth about $25,000. Did you roll negative equity? I might be able to. No, did you? From a previous car. 
[P6]  half of that? The interest on it is 25%. Oh my goodness. When I bought the car, it was during COVID. I needed a new car. Didn't have much credit and they would only approve me for a brand new car. I could not get approved for a used car. And you said, sure, 25% sounds good. 
[P7]  That's reasonable. Let's go. I need this $50,000 car. And when you're making $150,000, this is the problem. You feel like, okay, well, I can afford the payments. And if I can afford the payment, everything's fine. And that's the backwards way of going into when it comes to buying a car. But that's what a lot of people do. I can afford the payment. So regardless of how much interest it is, I can afford it. And then life happens, as you've experienced. Okay, job-wise, Alex, what were you doing before? You said you had two jobs that you lost. 
[P8]  What were those? I was a payroll manager for an IT company, and then I was an assistant manager for a retail store. Okay. And what happened to those jobs? The retail store ended up closing down, and I wasn't able to get relocated, and the IT firm also shut down. Oh, okay. So both companies closed. What are you doing now? 
[P9]  Okay. Okay. Um, single family, kids, single. Okay. Where are you living? Uh, Cleveland. Okay. Are you living alone? Renting? Uh, rent, uh, with a roommate, um, 1300 split between the two of us. Okay. That's good. Um, okay. So yeah, I mean the, getting the car out, do the 25,000 that it's worth, where did you pull that number from, from a dealership or from like Kelly Blue? 
[P10]  book uh kelly blue book and a couple other like just look uh like browsing seeing like what similar um but it's not trade-in value that's private party value yes private party oh man yeah because the problem is you need to come up with the difference even if you do a voluntary repossession they're going to sell it at auction for way less than it's even worth and you're still going to owe the difference yeah so it doesn't really it doesn't solve all of your problems to even do the voluntary repo that's why we're trying to find another solution 
[P11]  where you come up with the difference. I'd rather you be 25 grand in debt driving a beater than 47 grand in debt. Yeah, and that's kind of my thought process too. Trust me, I know this was probably the worst financial decision I've ever made. But yeah, I'd rather drive a hoopty at this point than, you know, drive this up. Are you able to keep current with your other bills, Alex, right now making 60? Yes. You are. 
[P12]  So your debt is not ongoing to keep lights on and everything? No, I'm slowly paying that off, thankfully. I mean, honestly, Alex, if I were in your shoes, I mean, I would figure out a way. I mean, it's about 18K for the difference of the car, and you're probably not going to be able to get a loan for the difference. Well, you said you owe 47 on the car? 43. Oh, 47. Oh, I wrote the 43. Okay. So you're 22 under. 
[P13]  local credit union, get a loan for the difference, maybe 25 grand and spend three of that on a beater car. But I don't know that they'd even grant you that loan at this point. Have you tried? No, I haven't tried. I kind of wanted to search all my options beforehand. Sure. That's the least harmful of the options is to go to a credit union and see if you can get the difference in a loan and maybe a little bit more in order to get a beater car, get rid of this payment, and then you'll be climbing your way out of this. And then hopefully in the meantime, 
[P14]  to six figures. Because clearly you're skilled enough and you're willing to do the work. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, if you can get that 60 up for a full-time job and find something 75 or 80, right, in like a perfect world. And then the side hustle is, I mean, that's what I would be doing, Alex. And I'm like, if you can make, God, I mean, you'd have to make 3,000 extra a month. I mean, I'm trying to do the math of how to do this within a year to get to even save the amount for the difference, right? So best bets, you can take a loan for the difference. 
[P15]  And like George said earlier, a local credit union is going to be your best bet versus a bank. They're the ones that are probably actually going to sit down with you and run more numbers and look. But so that would be my first option. And then if not, that's probably what I would do. I would probably try to get out of this car before anything else, even before the... It solves half your problems. Yeah. Yeah. If you can get out of that. And then now the second half, at least that's bearable. And you can climb out of that pretty quickly, even making what you make. 
[P16]  problem. But I do think income is the biggest part. And then your lifestyle is going to have to get cut down to nothing for probably the next 18 months. Yeah. And so this is no eating out. This is, hey, the roommate wants to, sorry, I can't hang out. I'm working three jobs. It's not going to be a fun journey. But the good news is you're young enough that you have a lot of time to make up for this. And so all hope is not lost. You don't need to go file for bankruptcy. George, would you, if you were him, would you save the $25,000 first, get the car out? 
[P17]  and then do the debt snowball? Ideally. I know. I just don't know how quickly he's going to save up $25. Yes, that is. Because I do wonder, Alex, too, if you paid off the six credit cards and did just the traditional debt snowball, how much payments monthly will be freed up because those are paid off. So even just working down the debt snowball, but knowing you have a freaking $1,200 car payment until you get to it to pay off is not fun. But in the meantime, I almost would just work the debt snowball until you get there. But thanks for the call, Alex. Good luck to you. We learn from our mistakes, George. We learn from our mistakes.

主题：Morgan亲属离世财务困境

输入内容：
[P149]  14th my sister-in-law passed away unexpectedly oh my gosh morgan that was just what two weeks ago two weeks ago um she's 38 and they have three children and it's been pretty tough i'm so sorry oh thank you that's heartbreaking um so what um how are they how are they doing 
[P150]  five and two. Um, the 15 year old is, um, is from a previous relationship. So I think financially her father is able to provide a lot, but, um, to be honest, they weren't prepared. I mean, nobody is, but, um, he's kind of in a financial mess. Okay. So I have a few numbers. I don't have all the details because it's still very fresh, but I've gathered a few things. Um, to my knowledge, they don't have very, I don't think they have any savings. Okay. Um, 
[P151]  their house two years ago for $170,000. I believe their mortgage is $1,400 a month. Okay. I think he makes, they both worked for a trucking company. I think he's in like the 70 to 80 range. Okay. And I believe she was about 60 to 70. So he's losing half of her income. Yeah. And also she was getting $1,700 a month in veteran benefits. And they did not pay for the survivor. No survivor benefits. So he lost that too. 
[P152]  have any life insurance on her? I think she had a small policy through her work, maybe $20,000. No will. They have $15,000 in credit card debt. Two cars. One has a small loan. I believe it's her car. And she may have a small 401k. She may. My question is, she might. I'm not sure. Is that him wondering if he does, or is it you just saying she might? It's me wondering because my wife and I have been following the 
[P153]  Dave steps for years. So we're on four, five and six. So my brain automatically went to right up the baby steps. I was just trying to gather everything I have. So that is kind of a high level overview. So I don't know if he should take her life insurance and just try to walk up the baby steps. I don't know if credit cards that are only in her name, if I should tell him to stop paying because autopsy results are pending. And so we may not get the death certificate for about two months. So I don't know if he can do much of anything until we get a death certificate. Yeah. 
[P154]  Oh, Morgan, I'm so sorry. So in these kind of situations, when there's something so unexpected and so tragic, we usually advise the families not to do anything major for probably about 12 months because there is... And that's why I haven't asked these questions yet. This is just kind of what I've gathered because this is, I mean, this is so heavy. It's just pure grief. Right, right. And he doesn't, I mean, he can't even probably, you know, 
[P155]  put together a thought. And so for you just to kind of be a side support, right. Um, and at least be able to gather and do, you know, some level of work for him is such a gift, Morgan. I mean, I mean, honestly, you're, uh, you're, you're giving them such a gift by even kind of navigating this part of their lives because everything, yeah. I mean, I just, I can't even imagine. Um, so I, you know, I wouldn't do anything again, big, um, from a decision standpoint, unless 
[P156]  they get to a point where there is something big, right? If they get six months into this and he can't pay the mortgage and there's foreclosures pending or like something like really big, right? Then we have to make some big decisions. But whatever I think he can do to the degree of staying somewhat afloat for a year, maybe some small things and we can maybe talk to you about those here on this call. But overall, I wouldn't make any big, big decisions. So I think, 
[P157]  um, because again, the emotion, you just can't see straight, you know, um, she handled all the finances. So he's trying to just open bills. What accounts do we have? I mean, he's starting from scratch. So it's, it's just tough all around. Oh, it's kind of where he's starting. Like he said, you know, I'm going to Verizon today to get my name on all the accounts. He's on a scavenger hunt while graving. I mean, that's, that's the hardest. Yeah. That's the hardest part is that life continues on right in the middle of all this. And you're like, I have to be a grownup. And like, 
[P158]  kids still need food do this yeah i mean oh oh so terrible okay um so yes i think you know your gut on starting to kind of just like put the baby steps in place that plan i think is is a good one um again i would i would take you know find the life insurance i would get as much concrete uh information as you can because that's going to help you guys navigate this but for him 
[P159]  I mean, to get him to live on 70K and be comfortable there probably will mean offloading some of this debt so that they don't have all these payments. And I would have him look through every account possible to see if there's any savings. And I would probably start working on paying off maybe these smaller debts if they do have credit card debt. And sell her a car and get rid of that loan. 
[P160]  That's a short-term thing that could relieve some pressure here. If there are credit cards only in her name? Yeah, if they're only in her name, he may not be liable for them. It just depends on how things are set up and will the estate pay it out of her assets and his name on that. I can't tell you for sure. If her name's on the mortgage, technically they can come after those things. They're not going to go after the mortgage or her retirement accounts, but if she has any other assets that can be used to pay this down, they will use that. 
[P161]  but I would not be in a rush to pay off this credit card debt. And I would not let the creditors pressure him and lie to him and say, no, you need to pay this today. Do send a copy of the death certificate to the credit card companies. Once you get those, get a bunch of copies, probably 10 copies minimum to send to all the creditors involved. So these credit cards are in just some, some of them are just in her name. Is that what you're saying, Morgan? I think they might be. I think a handful might be. And I would pull her credit report and his just to verify and make sure that, 
[P162]  Yeah, that that information is correct. Get a lay of the land. And you can do that for free. You can have them go to this website, annualcreditreport.com, I believe is the site. And you can pull and don't ever pay to get this pulled. Perfect. Yep, there it is, annualcreditreport.com. You can pull from all three bureaus and get a real picture of here's the reality of where we're at and now we know the next steps. And he's lucky to have you to help and clean up the pieces. And if we can help in any other way, let us know. But this is just one of those reminders 
[P163]  to everyone else listening, get a will in place today. It's not going to cause you to die any sooner, but it will cause your family to just grieve your loss instead of also lead you on a scavenger hunt and guess. Yeah. And have the government decide what happens to your stuff. May I address your listeners for just one minute? Please. Excuse me for getting emotional. Get this done, guys. Because instead of just being able to grieve, take three months off work, 
[P164]  it's off work, take the children on a trip. He's in a financial mess. So on top of grief, there's headache, frustration, and stress. So please, this stuff happens every day. I know, excuse me, none of us think it's going to happen to us until it does. So if anything, just get enough life insurance to cover these things while you clean them to babysit. Well said, Morgan. Thank you so much for 
[P165]  It's not easy to go on radio like this and share. I'm so sorry. Everyone listening, including us, we're thinking of them and praying for them and wishing them the best. And just to continue on what Morgan's saying, we believe in this so much, you guys, to get your wills done. Xander Insurance for life insurance. Get 10 to 12 times your annual income. If you're a stay-at-home mom, you need half a million at least on you. Get life insurance today. Morgan, we're praying for you guys. George, thanks for the hour. Thanks to everyone in the booth that's making it happen. 
[P166]  We'll be back.

[P85]  Take the accolades. You don't need to mention my name. And we are answering your questions this hour at 888-825-5225. And to start us off, we have Dustin in Palm Springs, California. Very nice area. Hey, Dustin, welcome to the show. Hey, thank you. So my wife and I, we're in our mid-30s, and we are so close to baby step seven, we can feel it. But we have one small hurdle that we got to jump over to get there and differing opinions kind of on how to resolve it 
[P86]  and maybe you guys can break a tie for us. Perfect. Can't wait. What is it? What's going on? All right. So we've knocked out all of our debt using the baby steps. We paid off about $350,000 worth over about two and a half years. Wow. $350,000 you guys paid off? Yeah. Well, not all paid off. We sold stuff. I mean, we had everything under the sun. Wow. Well done. Automobiles and campers and I don't even like camping. So all we have left now is our primary home and we do have a vacation home. 
[P87]  And what we want to do is sell our primary home and move into the vacation home, which we like better anyways. And basically, the net proceeds from selling our main house will pay off our vacation home, which will become our primary residence. Wow, great. Yeah, so we're ready to go. The problem is I bought the vacation home prior to our marriage, and I unfortunately bought it from a friend. He's carrying the note. And when I kind of brought up to him, you know, excited that, hey, I'm going to have a big check for you, he kind of pushed back. 
[P88]  And, you know, he's kind of saying he wants to spread his capital gains tax over the 10 year note that we'd agreed upon at the 4% interest rate and kind of just, you know, park his money in that investment. So my question is, how do I how do I do this? I don't want to burn a friendship. My wife wants me to just slap a check on his desk, but she doesn't have to play golf with him on Saturday morning. So I'm not really sure how to approach this conversation without, you know. So he basically kept the mortgage in his name and you just pay him the mortgage payment. 
[P89]  and he pays for it. No, we did it all legit. We went through a title and escrow company and we drafted up a purchase agreement. And basically it's just a loan from him, basically. You know, I did a 20% down payment with him and I do pay him, you know, basically as the bank. But I am on the title, the deed, all that stuff. Okay, okay. So it is your home. Correct. I mean, yeah, it's your home and he's just the bank is what that is. Just seller financing. Yes, correct. 
[P90]  And I wish I didn't do this because now I'm in this situation. But, yeah, basically when I brought up to him that, you know, I owe him about $500,000, and, you know, I have the ability, well, Will, once we sell this primary home, to pay him off. But he just doesn't sound very excited about it. He wants to just go per the terms of our agreement, pay it off over 10 years so he can, you know, expense that capital gains over the 10 years rather than all at once. Has he actually talked to a tax pro to see if this loan repayment counts as income? 
[P91]  have to pay tax on the interest portion of it, I think. And then, you know, on the principal, he's, you know, it's capital gains rate, I believe, because it was paid off, you know, for him. Yes. So to answer your question, yes, he said he talked to his CPA. And basically, if I pay it off, he will have to pay capital gains on the proceeds. Yeah. Is there anything in the contract that you signed with him that would prohibit you from just paying it off? And that's the issue. There's not. I've read over it a hundred times, and it's like, legally and all that, I can, you know, 
[P92]  go pay it off. Yeah. So boo-hoo, friends. Here's your 500,000. You're going to have to pay taxes on it. Did he not make money off of this? Did he not benefit from this whole thing? No. Yeah. He's going to make a lot of money off of it. You know, he bought it 25 years ago. So he's going to make quite a bit. I guess my worry is that I'm either going to upset my wife or my friend, right? Because it's like... Or your life, Justin. Or your life. You guys have freaking paid off $350,000. 
[P93]  life and you did this side deal with a friend and your life has changed and your priorities and your goals have changed. And so, sorry, friend. It's not like you're putting your friend in debt. Boo hoo. He gets $500,000 and he's going to have to pay some taxes on it. He can wipe his tears with $100 bills. Sorry, dude. And I'm being very insensitive. If I were you, I would feel much worse because it is a good friend. I don't have a lot of empathy for the friend. I mean, yeah, Dustin, the writing's on the wall. You have to do what's best for you and your family. It'd be very unwise. 
[P94]  to make an unwise financial decision for you and your family because of the feelings of a friend. And so I guess that's going to be a hard conversation I need to have with him and say, listen, this is our goal. And I think you can give him some time and say, hey, I'm not doing this tomorrow. You know, our goal is to do this in 12 months or whatever the goal is for you guys when you sell your primary home, all of that. Like if you can kind of map out a timeline, give him some time and space and just say, hey, yeah, this isn't happening tomorrow, but it will be happening in the next year. 
[P95]  I looked over the agreement that we signed and I'm sorry, I know it's not ideal in your situation, but like, this is, this is our values and our priorities with our families to be completely debt free. And, um, and, and yeah, this is what we're, we're deciding to do. And again, Dustin, you're not like completely screwing the guy. Like it's, you know what I mean? Like you're not paying you the debt back. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. He's a little older and that was part of it too, is he's like, well, you know, and he gave me a great interest rate at 4%. He's like, well, you know, I can kind of guarantee to make my 4% in that 
[P96]  money where, and he, like I say, he's a little older. In reality, he can just go park that in a high yield and make that. That was kind of the point I was trying to bring up to him. And he just didn't seem jazzed about it. And it put me in a weird situation where I'm like, man, I don't want to like burn a friendship with a guy that I, you know, I've had a long friendship with, but at the same time, I'm not matching up with the gold. And I'll be honest too, if you're a friend, I'm like trying to put myself in his position, right? If I ever was in that deal. And I had a young guy come to me and be like, you know, oh my gosh, we're able to get out of this deal. 
[P97]  because we have the cash, we have the money, we're so excited, we're going to be debt free. You would hope that it doesn't burn a friendship, that in fact, he celebrates with you. And you know what I mean? Which I know this way of thinking is different to celebrate being debt free. And be thankful a friend paid me back, which is very rare in today's world. And the other thing, Dustin, is that when he loaned you this money, the relationship already changed. It turned into a business partnership transaction and it moved away from friendship. And so this is what happens with friendship. So the truth is, 
[P98]  If you pay it off and he decides to not be your friend, was he really your friend? Yes, George. He's sure. There's a piece of it, though. I know what you're saying. I would never burn a friendship over them paying me back. Yeah, that's it. That's what I'm saying. If he really, Dustin, is not your friend anymore after this, then to George's point, then he's looking to make money off of you. You know what I mean? It feels weird if he is going to cut ties with you as a friend because of this move. That's weird. 
[P99]  Yeah, that would be weird. I don't think that would happen. It's just, I guess I'm, you know, I hate to even say this. I guess I'm kind of just being a sissy about having the conversation because of the vibe I got when I brought it up, you know, a couple of times over. And I even told, you know, my thought was just, let's just park our money that we make from the primary home in a high yield and just pay him off. And then I kind of, you know, we're quote unquote, we feel debt free ish because the money's there. But my wife says, you know, she's so excited because we did so good on the first, you know, six steps, call it, that she's ready to just get, 
[P100]  Finish, quote unquote, finish the journey and be done. Yes. My wife, her vote counts 1000 times more than any of my friends. And I love my friends. And you have a little bit of that people pleaser in you, Dustin. I hear it. And so, yeah, this is grown up stuff and be a man, suck it up and talk to him. And again, if he is weird after this because of this whole thing, like that's a weird guy. I'm going to add this to one more reason to not borrow money from friends. That's the new book. And family. 
[P101]  Yes, all of it. This is The Ramsey Show.

[P45]  I think that when I can add value, I will speak up. And at the end of the day, Mark Zuckerberg runs Meta. Yeah. And he'll make the final decisions. I think it's brilliant in the way that he brings people in that he likes and respects and wants to hear from. And everybody gives their opinion. And at the end of the day, Mark Zuckerberg makes the decisions. So the whole point of market capitalism is consumer choice. You have a choice between products and services. 
[P46]  And the competition between companies makes the goods and services better. That's the core idea. Unfortunately, there are an awful lot of monopolies out there. Monopolies are not good for consumers. They are not good for you. And one of the places where there's effectively a monopoly is in wireless contracts. But it's not a complete monopoly. You're probably paying way too much to use your cell phone. But now you have a choice. You don't have to pay $100 a month just to get a free phone.

[P49]  which is in America, and the rest of the world extorts them every day. That's what I've learned in my short- Extorts them, what do you mean? Extorts them. So if you are in some country, whatever country, that has Facebook or Instagram or whatever it is, and something gets posted and stays up that they don't like, they'll fine them, all kinds of crazy. Threaten to shut them down. Yeah. That's constant. Constant, daily. Yeah. 
[P50]  political effect i mean yeah there's no doubt those companies very powerful they can bring down governments very powerful and probably have unwittingly or not they are so when you think about um facebook instagram x um etc etc i mean this is the new media this is these are the the fox the abcs the nbcs you know of the future this this is like owning um a major network or the new york times or you know more more more power 
[P51]  I agree. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's like television plus newspapers because it has the emotional resonance and the full penetration. Like everywhere in the world, people are looking at this stuff. And it's immediate. As soon as something comes out, the whole world knows instantly. Right. So it's not surprising that country X, every other country, basically other than the United States, is going to be pushing Meta and Google and Elon at X to, you know, tailor this or that, according to their 
[P52]  demands, but the United States is based on the idea that citizens get to say what they think, period. It's the first point in the Bill of Rights. So what matters is they stay firm here. And do you think they will? That's a good question. I think they will for the next four years. I think they will for the next four years. I think you see them all except for Elon. I mean, let's be honest. Elon was a superhero through this whole. That's for sure. Yeah. You know what I mean? Where are we right now without Elon Musk?

输入内容：
[P61]  a couple weeks ago and I'll be at another Celtics game. And I just think that the NBA has gotten soft. And everybody sees it. In what sense? We were just talking about this at dinner tonight. I mean, if you look at the NBA when we grew up. Yeah. So I'm a lifelong diehard Celtics fan. Yeah, New England. But when people ask me about idols and heroes and all these kind of stuff, I've had people who've had influence on me, like Bruce Lee and Mike Tyson 
[P62]  people growing up but michael jordan michael jordan to me is i've never met michael jordan and i don't want to meet michael jordan i don't ever want to meet him i i i am that's probably a good biggest michael jordan fan ever of his mentality the way that he i like killers man and michael jordan was a killer and the stuff that his teammates say about him that everybody says i love love it um and and the nba just isn't like that you haven't seen that since 
[P63]  You know, it just doesn't have that. When you go back and think of the NBA from the 80s and 90s and all the different stars that you could remember from back then and how it was just a tougher game. You know what I mean? It was a lot tougher. And so many fouls and flopping and all the stuff that happens today isn't what the NBA used to be and what made the NBA big. You think they got you rich? 
[P64]  It happens. Happens in my business, too. You get too rich and things change. But I wouldn't say that, yeah, maybe you're right. Yeah. Money screws up a lot of things. Maybe money did. But, I mean, the game changed and society changed and they did become richer. I don't know. That's a tough one to bring around. Will that happen to you? Will you have soft fighters, do you think, at some point? Listen, everybody gets, everybody changes.

So my sister had her feelings about Zuckerberg and a lot of other people that are far right. But I'm just telling you, my relationship... Kelly's not far right. Kelly's just basically a sensitive person. Kelly's as far right as you are. So what did she think about you going on the meta board? 
[P37]  She didn't love it. And, you know, but I said, listen, Mark Zuckerberg isn't what everybody thinks he is. He's not as bad as everybody thinks he is. Well, I do think it was, I mean, we're just watching it from afar, not talking to you about it, but I thought the one thing that everyone knows about you is you're opposed to censorship. You're clearly, I mean, again, this week you had, you came out and you said one of your fighters said something you thought was disgusting and you hated, but you're not firing him. Like you've kind of taken a stand. 
[P38]  again, censorship very publicly again and again and again, you know, Facebook is known for censorship. So probably a good thing they're putting you on the board. Like what's going to happen when you're sitting in a meeting like we need to censor stuff we disagree with. I think that's why I'm there. I'm not there for my technical capabilities.

[P11]  ever met you know and uh i say it all the time i've i've never seen anybody that that operates the way that this man does and and it's such a and you know what was what was badass um the um press conference that he had the other day right um when when the helicopter crashed into the plane yeah room was packed he's calling off questions people are jumping over each other their hands are thrown up when have you seen 
[P12]  that kind of energy in the White House, especially within the last however many years. You had a guy who couldn't talk publicly. You had a vice president who couldn't speak publicly. I know the girl who was in the last administration, the secretary of whatever the hell she was, that goes out and does the press conferences. She's taking a lot of heat, but could you imagine having that job during the Biden administration? No. 
[P13]  Absolutely brutal. Horrifying. Right? The girl's got to go out and lie pretty much every day. And any type of question that made sense, she would just shut it down and walk out and leave. I mean, that had to be the worst job in America. There couldn't be a worse job. And she did the worst job you could do at the worst job. With what she had to work with, I actually feel bad for that woman. I actually feel bad for that woman. Cut that woman some slack, please. I mean, imagine that's your job, that you have to go out during that administration and face the media every day. 
[P14]  But anyway, that's besides the point. That was incredible. The last press conference when he was out there, it was like people were climbing over each other. And he gets right in there, fires away and answers questions. And, you know, he's incredible. There's nothing like this guy. And how much he's done in the short amount of time that he's been there. So where's the opposition to him? It seems like all of a sudden, you know, we spent eight years hearing that, you know, he's this evil tyrant who's going to suspend the Constitution and enslave the nation. 
[P15]  and then he wins and you don't there's like kind of no opposition what happened like do you know any liberals still well you know it's funny i you know i'm one of these guys and you and i've had this conversation before i don't judge anybody by their politics yeah and i follow like cnn and msnbc and all these other and and because i like to hear everybody msnbc i don't even know how they're still on the air they are the nuttiest i i had to unfollow for me to do that it's like i love hearing 
[P16]  Everybody's opinion. They are nuts. It's like, I can't even listen to them. They're so, it's almost like a comic strip. Like it's a cartoon, that network. It's like a cartoon. It's so bad. It's unbelievable. And it's the whole, if Trump says it's blue, they say it's black. If it's, you know, it's just, it's so bad. But yeah, no. One by a landslide. Anyone in your personal life? No. Do you feel like there's been a change? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[P17]  that I know that is a hardcore liberal and they're out there arguing about anything anymore. It's dead. It's all gone. Actually, the exact opposite. The people that I know that were very liberal, they're not very right, but they're definitely not very left. I know. Right? And everyone seems to have accepted free speech as the status quo now. I think so. You've been sticking with that for, well, through the middle of all of this.

[P4]  It was awesome. I think you've known him better than almost anyone around him for longer. He and I are very close. I know, and have been for a long time. And that became pretty obvious late in the campaign when, even though you're not political, you wound up kind of associated with Trump just because you know him so well. Do you think he's changed since July when he got shot? Do you notice a change? For the better. Yeah. How? Yeah, I think that, listen, at the end of the day, 
[P5]  and as tough as this guy is, you know, when you almost get assassinated the way that he was, I think it messes with you a little bit. And the thing about him is, I talked to him, I was flying to Italy when he was shot at. And I called him as soon as I landed. And he had just got home from the hospital. And he seemed unfazed. Yes. Which is, it's just not even, it's not humanly possible. 
[P6]  but he did but then after after that he flew the next day to the RNC in Milwaukee and literally never never rested never took a break never stayed out of the limelight after almost getting shot and I don't know I just felt like it for him it affected him but he made a complete recovery from that thing he did I talked to him also that night and he seemed totally 
[P7]  unaffected, but how could you be totally unaffected? Do you think there were long-term good consequences? I mean, he went on to be more successful than he's ever been, right? It's just a testament to his toughness, his resilience, his grittiness. And I think this is what I truly believe. I think that to his core, he believes that God spared him to run this country for the next four years. And I think that had a lot to do with his mentality,

[P19]  of the conflict. I agree. In Israel and the Arab countries, both people were happy. I agree.

Well, did you ever notice that every time I have Trump at a UFC event, every fighter walks over to him and, you know, pays respect to him. And all the fighters love him from all over the world.

输入内容：
[P29]  alien vibe at all? I actually like Mark. No, listen, if I felt that way about Zuckerberg, I would have never been on the board. I would have never. So my head of PR actually hit me up one day and says, hey, Mark Zuckerberg's looking for your number. Can I give it to him? And I said, yeah, of course. So he called me and he said, would you mind coming up to my place in Tahoe and having dinner? And I said... What's his place in Tahoe like? I'll tell you. So I don't know Mark Zuckerberg. Never talked to him. 
[P30]  Saw the movie. You know, that's as much as I knew about Mark Zuckerberg. So I walk into his living room of his house and they put me in the living room to wait. And he's got this American flag on the wall with like 13 stars on it or whatever. You know what I mean? And I'm like, off to a good start. In the back, he's got a house right on the lake. The biggest American flag you've ever seen in your life ripping in the wind in the backyard. Really? 
[P31]  100%. Then he comes in, we sit down, we have dinner, and we probably talk for four hours. And I walked away from that first meeting liking Mark. And we started to create a relationship from there. We talked, and he's a UFC fan, and we became friends. Then the whole Elon versus Mark Zuckerberg fight thing that was going on at that time, 
[P32]  and I was in the middle of it and I had a blast doing the negotiations with that thing, talking to Elon for an hour every night, talking to Mark an hour every night. And then I was literally- What were the negotiations about? About the fight, where it would be, what weight classes, this, that, what could you do, what couldn't you do? And I was literally doing conference calls with the government in Italy to do this thing in the Colosseum in Rome. 
[P33]  the right number, the Coliseum was going to let us do that fight there. And then eventually it, you know, it started to fall apart. Um, but while it lasted, it was fun. And through that, Mark and I became even closer. And then, uh, I flew from Italy to, um, to the RNC. I spoke at the RNC and I flew back to Italy, my vacation with my family. And, uh, I got a text from Mark that said, Hey, can you talk for a minute? 
[P34]  I called him back and he said, this is what he said to me. I think you're a great businessman. You always seem to be on the right side of everything. And my company needs a backbone. I would be honored if you would sit on the board for Meta. This was right after your RNC speech? Right after, as soon as I landed back in Italy. He gave $350 million to Joe Biden's campaign in 2020. That's kind of wild that he's watching you at the RNC and is like, I like what you have to say.

输入内容：
[P5]  in journalism? And looking back, what do you think were the key factors that made you successful? Curiosity is the most important quality, I think, for a journalist. That you never think that you know everything. You want to find out things, sometimes that people don't want you to find out. And then you tell stories and you're interested in people. So for me, curiosity, not cynicism, 
[P6]  is the most important quality to have. I agree. That is such a powerful quality to have. And it then allows you to constantly dig, dig deeper and uncover things that other people would not uncover, either through research or your own critical thinking. Yeah, and I obviously I've worked in many places abroad in the country, in the UK. I mean, I started my career somewhat as an outsider in Scotland. I was English in Scotland,

输入内容：
[P73]  things people could learn from son, what would you say? Think about making money not just as an innovator, a great innovator like Steve Jobs. You can make a lot of money as a middleman or a middlewoman. You can position yourself, for example, like Masa, as somebody who is the gateway to Japan and China for the Americans. He did that brilliantly because he spoke 
[P74]  English, but he understood the Japanese domestic market. I think also the power of FOMO. I mean, use the fear of missing out to get people to come on board or invest in you, because they'll give you money if they think they're going to miss out on a great opportunity. And Masa is amazing at giving that sense of fear of missing out. That's how he got all the money from the Saudis for the Vision Fund, 
[P75]  That's how he got money from older people, that he could talk a great game about what was coming. And people needed to give him money because he knew the future. He could see it. But obviously, at the same time, I think he showed some management weaknesses. Obviously, the Japanese continent is very loyal, but some of the more other mercenary types. 
[P76]  There was a lot of infighting, and that did a lot of damage to the company's reputation. So I always wondered, if he is the big boss, you should have sorted that out a bit earlier. I wanted to wrap up with two questions outside of this topic. One is, are there specific routines, success habits, so to say, that you follow on a daily or weekly basis that really help you be an incredible professional that you are?

主题：重要决策时刻的感悟

输入内容：
[P80]  to ask the last question for today is over the last few years, or even any amount of time you want to consider, what were maybe two, three aha moments, realizations that really changed the way you look at life or the way you look at business? One of the important challenges for the Financial Times was, were we going to go with our new app into the Apple store? And that would have meant handing over all our data 
[P81]  Apple and also paying them 30% of our revenues for our subscriptions gained through the app. And so we decided that we would not do that. We admired Apple. Apple is an incredible company. It continues to be an incredible company with incredible products, consumer products. Their stock price, their valuation is amazing. But we decided we're not going to be part of that. 
[P82]  We're going to be confident enough in our brand that we won't succumb to that distribution problem and hand over essentially the gold data, which is the consumer. We weren't going to be disintermediated. And you know what? We got an enormous amount of respect from consumers and friends of the FT. We made new friends because we were prepared to sort of stand up to the big guy, a very impressive big guy, but a big guy. And so I think occasionally, 
[P83]  Standing up to big, powerful things is a good thing to do. I think the second issue was, you know, on Wirecard, this was cost a lot of money to defend. We had legal bills. But I understood that I did my due diligence with the reporters. I knew the reporters very well. And therefore, I was prepared to have a fight. And I was prepared to pay. 
[P84]  and get the board to understand that this was going to cost a lot of money. But in the end, the FT was going to be right. It was going to be absolutely a fantastic story. And as a result of having, again, a fight, a difficult one, but the value of sticking to your guns and backing the reporters had immeasurable value to the organization 
[P85]  of a culture. And when you're thinking about very important things for a company like recruitment and retention, and I think they're very important for an editor because it's all about talent. If you do something like that, which is obviously courageous, and you're also right, you're going to get 10 times the amount of benefits. I know. Thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it. And I appreciate all your work and can't wait to read your book about your time being an editor.

[P7]  1979. And that wasn't necessarily easy because there was a lot of strong Scottish nationalism around at the time, you know, seen as somebody from Oxford, a bit privileged. I don't think I did come from a particularly privileged background. My father left school when he was 14, 15, and he didn't go to university. My mother didn't go to college. So we weren't well off, but he was in journalism and he inspired me. 
[P8]  that way and then from scotland i worked in london but then soon went to america i worked there worked at the washington post on a fellowship worked as the washington correspondent and then in brussels for six years so i covered the end of the cold war in america and then i spent a bit of time in california then went to brussels covering the whole european construction the single currency enlargement and then you know 
[P9]  took some executive jobs in London running the news operation, but also went back to America and covered Wall Street and ran the American operation before becoming the big boss, the editor in 2005. So I had a lot of foreign experience as a journalist. And then, as you say, as editor, you know, I did two things, I suppose. One was to transform the Financial Times into a digital operation, going first and expanding the audience, 
[P10]  but also then making it my business to interview leaders because leadership has always fascinated me. So I did interview everybody from Vladimir Putin to Trump to Modi in India to two Chinese premiers to Cyril Ramaphosa in South Africa. I traveled around the world as part of my job. And I think that gave me a different perspective

[P15]  you manage journalists. I describe it as managing 550 brilliant anarchists. I'm looking forward to reading it. Thank you so much for sharing this. Was there a specific moment in your career where everything changed for you? Maybe a decision or turning point that set you on the path to leading the Financial Times? Well, the day I became editor, that certainly changed everything because I was suddenly the big boss and the buck stops. 
[P16]  with you when you're editor. I mean, if you're smart, you'll gather the best people around you so you're capable of delegating because nobody can do everything. So I made it my business to assemble the strongest team possible. It meant some changes. It made some difficult decisions necessary. But as I tell people, if you're the editor, you're not running a popularity 
[P17]  contest. The most important thing is you're guardian of the gold standard of journalism, and you're responsible for excellence. And that means being fairly uncompromising, but it also means not being a dictator. You have to be an enlightened despot. How's that? A bit like Frederick the Great. I think that there's a lot to think about there and explore. I can't wait to read your book on this.

输入内容：
[P76]  There was a lot of infighting, and that did a lot of damage to the company's reputation. So I always wondered, if he is the big boss, you should have sorted that out a bit earlier. I wanted to wrap up with two questions outside of this topic. One is, are there specific routines, success habits, so to say, that you follow on a daily or weekly basis that really help you be an incredible professional that you are? 
[P77]  I think that the exercise point is really important and still doing that. So your mind is fresh. I think don't get into a comfort zone. Always be thinking, well, I'm doing quite well now, but there must be some way of I can do better or look at things differently. And that means you've got to be open to other people. That you don't just say it's my way or the highway. 
[P78]  I mean, obviously, as the editor, when you're making big decisions about stories, even though I knew what I thought we should do, and, you know, we were being legally challenged, for example, on Wirecard, a couple of times I just brought in colleagues to find out what they thought. But I was also testing them to think about how good they were and whether their judgment was good. And at that time, I was, 
[P79]  planning succession, which is the last point, that if you're a leader, any responsible leader has to think about succession. So, by the way, a question that Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank that employs thousands of employees, but there isn't an obvious successor, and we don't know what's going to happen to SoftBank when he passes, or I don't think he will hand the reins over. 
[P80]  to ask the last question for today is over the last few years, or even any amount of time you want to consider, what were maybe two, three aha moments, realizations that really changed the way you look at life or the way you look at business? One of the important challenges for the Financial Times was, were we going to go with our new app into the Apple store? And that would have meant handing over all our data

And thank you so much for writing books, because that is one of the ways to learn from you. Although I would love to see a book about you as well. Well, I did write a book, which were my private diaries as the editor of the Financial Times between 2005 and 
[P12]  It's got a rather strong title called The Powerful and the Damned, Private Diaries in Turbulent Times. And it captures the sort of challenges of editing a newspaper. I had one of the best journalist jobs in the world, editing the Financial Times during the global financial crisis, the Arab Spring, the New Cold War. 
[P13]  between America and China, the rise of authoritarianism and populism, all these trends. And of course, obviously, perhaps most important of all, this incredible technological revolution that we're in the middle of now and that we're seeing accelerate, which is transforming every aspect of human life. So all of that is in the book, and it's what I'm concentrating on now. And that is already out. 
[P14]  that book? It is. I published the book, The Powerful and the Damned, in 2020. So a few months after I stepped down as editor.

[P51]  I see exactly. So look, Masayoshi Son, that's two names. Masayoshi is Japanese and Son is Korean. And when he was growing up, his family had a Japanese name, Yasumoto. But Masa wanted to have, he didn't want to live undercover. He wanted to come out and be his own person. So I think that was amazing. 
[P52]  massive motivation for him to overcome his second-class citizenship, his second-class status. And he did it by actually leaving for America when he was a teenager and going to Berkeley in California. So that's where he learned his English properly and where he came to grips with the microchip internet revolution, not the internet, but microchip, which was sort of 
[P53]  a technological foundation for his successors as a businessman. And it is incredible how he realized he needed to go to the U.S. Well, his family didn't want him to go to the U.S. because, remember, his father had grown up in a shantytown in a slum, a Korean slum, after the war. And while he was a teenager, he left school at 14, his father was a, 
[P54]  bootlegger, a pig breeder, a loan shark, and then made his fortune in pachinko gambling, which is this kind of semi-underworld activity of slot machines, which the Koreans got into because that was the only area where they were really permitted to work. They couldn't work as teachers, they couldn't work in the police force or in the local government or anything like that because they were Korean. 
[P55]  So, I mean, they could have done if they naturalized and become Japanese. But if they wanted to stay Korean, then they were right on the fringes of society. But Masayoshi Son said, I don't want to go into slot machine gambling. I want to go into the business of my choice. And he decided to go into software distribution. And that was an idea that came to him when he was a student at California. 
[P56]  I thought he had a slightly better sense of humor than I imagined. I mean, he does like to joke. I think it's a bit of a theater act. The second thing that surprised me is I couldn't believe how his risk appetite was ginormous. I mean, this is a man who's bet the company numerous times. He's prepared to do things that most people just wouldn't have the stomach for the risk.

[P42]  the computer, that you're out and doing physical as well as mental exercise. We spoke earlier about subscriptions and I wanted to ask you, so you obviously did a remarkable job figuring out how do you transition, how do you adapt to changing times. For someone who is listening to us right now and they feel that their business is dying because the world has changed and they have to find another business model, are there any ways you can recommend 
[P43]  they follow to kind of think about it, to maybe see something they're not seeing right now? Well, if your business is dying, the question is, are you aware it's dying or are you in effect Mr. Kodak or Mrs. Madame Kodak, where the camera business is completely, you know, and they thought they could make the best camera and that would save the business and it didn't. So the question is, at what stage, 
[P44]  Are we? Are we on the way to the funeral parlor? Or are we still got two or three years to go? I mean, if you're on the way to the funeral parlor, that's pretty difficult. I mean, you have to exercise some very, very powerful changes. You probably do need to reduce costs, but you can't cut your way out of trouble. So I think probably, 
[P45]  the way I look at it is what is the core of your business that you think is the most valuable? And is there any way that you're neglecting that because you're trying to do too many other different things? Is there any way of going back to the core and slightly changing that? Is it a distribution problem? Is it a pricing problem? And then is there anything that, you know, 
[P46]  of mine pivoted from tobacco to luxury i mean that's not that's pretty counter-intuitive but he had the money and the the tobacco business at that time was still profitable and making quite a lot of money so he had the money to reinvest in a luxury brands business so again it's a question of you know how big is your business how the scale 
[P47]  And then maybe lastly, you know, ask your workforce. What should we be doing next? I mean, again, you don't necessarily have a monopoly on wisdom. Wise words. You recently wrote a book and you, of course, covered so many influential figures during your career. Why did you choose to write about Masayoshi-san specifically?

[P36]  also generate revenue. But fortunately, I don't have to worry about it now. I did my bit. It took nearly 15 years. Yes, you did more than enough for that organization. How do you stay sharp and informed and continue developing yourself? Anything you will be comfortable sharing that people could potentially adapt for themselves? First, I'm very competitive. I hate being beaten. 
[P37]  First, I want to be right. I want to be correct. And the more experience you get, you know, we did some huge stories, particularly towards the end of my tenure as editor, particularly the Wirecard exposure. And if you haven't seen that documentary, Scandal, that sort of tells the story of the investigation into this Germany's Enron. I mean, a huge financial scandal, $2 billion of losses. 
[P38]  money that disappeared. One of the top executives now, a fugitive, financial fugitive in Russia. He was running half a spy operation. It was the most incredible story. And we'd never been able to do that if it hadn't been for, you know, putting a lot of preparation in first. But I love that kind of reporting. And that kept me sharp. I think making sure that you bring in new people who challenge you, 
[P39]  up. And the third piece of advice, apart from, because you need, when you bring in people, you can't just bring in lots of people. I used to describe it as having a skin graft. So you weren't having a heart transplant, it was a skin graft. So you bring in somebody and try and socialize them, get them used to the culture of the financial times, and then tap their expertise. But lastly, I would urge any leader to, 
[P40]  go into the gym. I used to run 4K twice a week without fail. And if I got under 18 minutes, I knew I was as sharp and I was ready to go into battle. And just do some weights, just have some downtime. And if you have a partner and they're prepared to be patient, that helps too, because you can't have all the knowledge and all the pressure stored up in your own brain. 
[P41]  you'll go crazy. And it's interesting when you start exercising, all other areas of your life improve as well. I think it's really important. I mean, I do cycling as well. I don't do the 4K on the machine so easily, but I walk at least 10,000 steps a day still. I cycle. I play a bit of tennis. And I think all of that kind of exercise is important so that you don't just get stuck in front of 
[P42]  the computer, that you're out and doing physical as well as mental exercise. We spoke earlier about subscriptions and I wanted to ask you, so you obviously did a remarkable job figuring out how do you transition, how do you adapt to changing times. For someone who is listening to us right now and they feel that their business is dying because the world has changed and they have to find another business model, are there any ways you can recommend

[P26]  find a way of finishing on a high note. So those are some of the tips. Very, very powerful. Breathing, all of the things you said, will make a huge difference. So I hope people will implement it starting today. You obviously led FT through massive shifts. You discussed some of it today. How did you personally manage change and uncertainty in such a fast-moving environment? When I took over at the FT, the business model was broken. And I said that to the board. 
[P27]  They were not very happy. But I said, it's true. We can't just rely on advertising. We need to become a subscription business. And I will deliver the journalism, which will make people happy to pay for the journalism. But you need to figure out how this new business model will work with subscription. The second thing I thought was, well, my predecessor kind of messed up a bit. 
[P28]  He wasn't that good. So I'm surely going to be able to do better than that. And the third is that if you're a general in an army, you're leading an army, and the army just wants to know which direction to march, it probably doesn't know the right direction. And maybe the general doesn't know the right direction. But as long as you're not marching to Moscow in winter, because that's not so good, 
[P29]  to set a sense of direction to the troops and be clear about that. And then the last point, which was a very good piece of advice given to me by Sir Howard Stringer, who at that time was the head of Sony, a Welsh-American, first foreigner to lead Sony, the consumer electronics giant. And I said to him, what advice would you give me? And he said, you're going to embark on a big period of change. 
[P30]  So whatever you do, you need to be very clear that you need to articulate the message of change all the time. Because you'll think that you've got the message across after two times, but actually you won't have even persuaded these journalists 10 times or maybe 12 times. So you have to keep repeating the message of why change is necessary, 
[P31]  how it's going to happen, think of a few phrases. And that's what I did. I talked about digital first. I talked about the importance of a return to the gold standard. And by repeating these phrases, suddenly all the other journalists started repeating them and you started getting the army to march in the right direction. Do you think that subscription model is still relevant? Because what happened is there were so many subscriptions, 

[P32]  subscription models that consumers, customers then had too many subscriptions, then they started cutting it out? Well, it's more challenging now everybody's gone that route. But first of all, there's first mover advantage. And the second is it all comes down to the brand, doesn't it? And if you've got a very powerful worldwide brand like the Financial Times, I think you're going to get a certain amount of customer loyalty. But you need to be incredibly 
[P33]  uh careful to get the best talent and to focus on the right subject so that people feel very attached to the brand and at the financial times you know if you think of the weekend people really like reading it at the weekend it's an incredibly valuable product it's where you know we charge five pounds in the uk it's incredible but there are things like lunch with eft you know other features 
[P34]  of the weekend, the essays and the columnists, all this needs to be constantly kept happy and fresh in order to make the proposition. Now, it may be true that the subscription model needs to be adapted a bit. And you're certainly correct that the subscriptions pile up. But then you need to think about what are the other ways of doing it. 
[P35]  I mean, it's not my challenge now. I mean, the fact is that the FT, we completely transformed the business with subscription because we doubled the audience and we doubled the paying audience through digital. But I think probably adding some extra products, value-added products around that brand, 
[P36]  also generate revenue. But fortunately, I don't have to worry about it now. I did my bit. It took nearly 15 years. Yes, you did more than enough for that organization. How do you stay sharp and informed and continue developing yourself? Anything you will be comfortable sharing that people could potentially adapt for themselves? First, I'm very competitive. I hate being beaten.

主题：给年轻专业人士的职业建议

输入内容：
[P18]  Many people struggle to stand out in their careers. So many of our listeners, they are very successful, but they want to have much bigger impact and much more influential roles within the organizations. Beyond curiosity, which is very important, what advice would you give to young professionals who want to make an impact in a competitive industry? I would give several pieces of advice. The first is you need to have multiple skills. So you can't just be a writer. 
[P19]  You need to understand the basics of coding. You need to be able to communicate across multiple platforms. You need to be able to go on video and audio. And you need to be able to understand data. So that's the first big change. You need to be sort of multitasking. 
[P20]  good to have mentors. Find people who can teach you some things and teach you where the traps are. Don't always be too much in a hurry. Be aware of what's going on around you and find mentors. And then the last thing I would do is, many people find this hard, and I certainly found it hard initially, 
[P21]  speak you need to get people to pay attention and you need to be able to command a room and that means being very clear about what you're going to say when you're going to say it and if you have to give a public speech then make it short but train for it and I think just one last piece which is linked is a lot of people say to me 
[P22]  what's the best way to do an interview? What's the thing not to do? And I found this when I was interviewing very powerful people like Vladimir Putin, is you don't want to interrupt him all the time. You should let him speak and then you should not be tempted to fill the silence. Let them fill the silence because that way you get more time to think. You're not in a hurry, but you also put them more at ease. 

[P23]  Very powerful advice. And you can also use it even in your conversations, especially important conversations you have in personal and professional life. That's quite right. You mentioned commanding the room. For someone who is struggling with that, what advice could you give? Breathe properly. So when you go into the room, make sure you've just inhaled a little bit in and out. Because if you're not breathing properly, 
[P24]  out of your mouth will sound awful. And then you can never recover. The second thing to do is always find out who is in the room. Because if you don't know who you're speaking to, you'll never make an impact. And the third thing is, when you start speaking, if there's a way of you looking at various people in the room, 
[P25]  So don't just focus on one person. Focus on several people. And if you recognize anybody, say early on. And as Jack or as Jane was saying just the other day, and then you've got the audience on side. And the most important thing is to work out what do you actually want to say. And don't apologize. Don't say, I'll only be brief. 
[P26]  find a way of finishing on a high note. So those are some of the tips. Very, very powerful. Breathing, all of the things you said, will make a huge difference. So I hope people will implement it starting today. You obviously led FT through massive shifts. You discussed some of it today. How did you personally manage change and uncertainty in such a fast-moving environment? When I took over at the FT, the business model was broken. And I said that to the board.

主题：传主特点与决策方式分析

输入内容：
[P56]  I thought he had a slightly better sense of humor than I imagined. I mean, he does like to joke. I think it's a bit of a theater act. The second thing that surprised me is I couldn't believe how his risk appetite was ginormous. I mean, this is a man who's bet the company numerous times. He's prepared to do things that most people just wouldn't have the stomach for the risk. 
[P57]  I think there were things that I found extraordinary about his ambition. He wanted to be number one, not just in Japan, but in the world. He's an empire builder. He's compared himself seriously to Napoleon. And his father used to tell him that he is genius. Yeah, it does do all sorts of odd things to you if you're told aged five. 
[P58]  that you're a genius. I mean, you do feel a bit like a princeling. You think you're right. And I think he did have a very inventive mind. I mean, he was telling his father how he could get more business at the restaurants that he owned. And he claims to have been able to understand the principle of discounting in order to grow your market. So all these things marked him out as something special. 
[P59]  He set up his own business in Japan and he couldn't get a bank loan. Nobody would lend him credit. So he had to rely on a mentor. I was talking about the importance of mentors earlier. And his mentor basically said, I am ready to mortgage my house so that you can get a loan. I'll guarantee the loan via my house. That's pretty amazing. It is amazing. Even many parents would not do it for you. 
[P60]  There you go. What do you think is different about his decision making? How does he make decisions differently from most people? I think he really can go just on the gut. I mean, he did meet Jack Maher of Alibaba and he made a decision to invest $20 million, later $100 million into Alibaba. And Alibaba was only a few months old. Goldman Sachs had put some money in, but he just went in and all his, 
[P61]  Chinese people present, the fellow investors, said, no, we don't want to put money in Jack Ma, but he felt in his gut that that was the right thing to do. And of course, he was spectacularly right. He's always gone with the gut, and he got it wrong with Adam Newman of WeWork. But he got it right with Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo. So he does things with conviction. He's really prepared to take risk. 
[P62]  He's prepared to take a lot of losses up front in order to grow the market. So he's a sort of early Amazon business model or a bit like Rupert Murdoch and BSkyB satellite broadcasting. You know, go for total market. Think about total market access ability and then think about your profit and loss account. He's always been interested more in revenue than actually P&L. 
[P63]  I think it's that. 
[P64]  Absolutely, because he says, well, I made that decision. I live with it. I mean, that's what I did. What am I supposed to do? He also would say, if you come from nothing, and by the way, he was only poor for a few years. I mean, once his father got into pachinko gambling, or even before, you know, they were quite well off. So they didn't spend a lot of time in the slum. He likes to play that up. 

[P65]  If you know that your parents have had nothing, then if you lose everything, you just go back to nothing. And that was what you were like. So I think he has that sort of philosophy. I do think that he likes to pretend that he's really sorry he made the mistake. And he goes and does penance. He retires from public view. But actually, he's just plotting his comeback. 
[P66]  people who have this very strong feeling of making a mistake and then they punish themselves for it? Do you think it is one of the key things that is holding them back? I do because I would cite, and I remember listening to Jeff Bezos when he first said this, he distinguished between good failure and bad failure. And bad failure is when you keep doing the same thing. You know you've made the mistake, so why are you doing the same thing 
[P67]  and over again. You've given the person the job, they've messed up. I mean, why put them through the same problem? Or you've adopted this approach and it didn't work, so why go back to it? I think there's good failure where you're trying very hard to do something and it just doesn't come off for various reasons. That's okay, you learn. As long as you learn from, you know, that's good failure. So distinguishing between the two is very important. 
[P68]  It probably comes back to the time when he was growing up and he was his father's potentially favorite son. Yeah, he was the favorite son, yeah. Second son. Yes. He was told that he's genius. So when you're treated that way by parents, then you kind of use that same model for the way you treat yourself throughout the rest of your life. I think that is true, that he considers himself something of a genius. And he would cite his father. His father told me when I interviewed him. 
[P69]  aged 87 in the family home. And the family home is full of photographs of the father and the son, often wearing baseball caps. And it's a bit like a shrine. It's extraordinary. But the father was so proud of his son that his son had become a mega billionaire. And, you know, he'd been rich, but his son had become super rich. 
[P70]  this sense that you are a princeling and a genius that does encourage you to take risks, but it can also lead to sometimes, I think, reckless behavior. It is something that those listeners who are parents need to think about to what degree they need to tell their children that they are number one. How do you balance them having the self-confidence, but at the same time not being reckless? Yeah, it's tricky because obviously, 
[P71]  if you're going to make a bet on something and you've done a certain amount of homework, then sometimes you're going to fail. I do quote in the book Thomas Edison. It's one of my favorite quotes because Masak is constantly talking about his vision. And it's a technocentric vision. It's one that essentially says, I understand the path of technology and the essence of technology. 
[P72]  But as Thomas Edison said, vision without execution is hallucination. So execution is really important. And sometimes Masa has not paid enough attention to the execution. He's been carried away by the founder, just the vision. So think about the execution. 
[P73]  things people could learn from son, what would you say? Think about making money not just as an innovator, a great innovator like Steve Jobs. You can make a lot of money as a middleman or a middlewoman. You can position yourself, for example, like Masa, as somebody who is the gateway to Japan and China for the Americans. He did that brilliantly because he spoke

Who knows what's going to happen with insurance, right? Right, but see, that's the problem. Unfortunately, the fire insurance issue in Los Angeles is kind of insane. It's terrible. Where, you know, we were talking in the lobby before I was evacuated three times when I lived in L.A. Two of my neighbors lost their homes, you know, and watching those folks cry.

Two of the houses are still gone in my old neighborhood. They never rebuilt. Sorry to hear about that. They just pulled out. It's like, what am I going to do? They lose everything.

[P58]  needed. Even the spin masters, even the greatest of gaslighters have nothing. There's not one person who's tried to pass the buck.

Not one. You're right. Not one. That's kind of crazy. It is kind of crazy. Because they gaslight everything, no matter what it is. Everything's safe and effective. Everybody's fine. 
[P59]  Everything's great. He's sharp as a tack. They gaslight the shit out of you with everything. But with this one, they're like, there's nothing you can say. I agree with that because the facts are the facts. The facts are the facts. You just can't argue around the facts. And also there's a thing that happens when an area bigger than Manhattan that's filled with the most liberal people. They're the most liberal. They're the most blue no matter who.

[P193]  You wanted to get the place rebuilt. So how long is this woman still going to be the mayor for? Well, she's there for, you know, I think about 18 months or so. And she already announced before the fires she's going to run for reelection. But we'll see how that plays out. As a private citizen, it's this group that I put together that's going to work really closely, pushing the city, finding solutions, sort of calling out when they're not doing what they need to be doing. 
[P194]  And I'm hopeful that that's going to be really effective. And like I said, bending the curve, shortening the timeline to get people in. And that's going to take most of my time and most of my day. I got a small, mighty staff that I hired for it. I'm going to fund it myself. I'm going to use all the resources from my company and the talent we have in the company to help find answers to rebuild it. We got guys like, you know, Joe Lonsdale is a part of that group, one of the biggest thinkers around. 
[P195]  Patterson's, you know, one of the great Gensler architectural firms. Everybody's donating time and talent. And so we want to push the needle on this thing. And then politics will come down the road. We'll figure that out. Well, that sounds wonderful. But it seems to me that, like, unless you're at the cockpit, unless you're, you know, controlling the direction of the city, it's going to be very hard to really change things in a meaningful way. It's a good challenge for sure.

Um, and then when January 7th hit with the fire, the world sort of stopped and I want to spend a lot of time right now trying to get it rebuilt. There's going to be time for politics for me for sure.

[P50]  But you could have mitigated it. We don't really know the source of the fire yet. And we do know there was quite a bit of arson. That's true. That's true. And there was a fire, to your point, there was a fire on New Year's Eve from fireworks. And there's some talk that it may have been in that same area that this sparked up again. Or maybe it was another arson that went up there. But it seemed like there were several fires that started very close to each other. It seems like highly unlikely. 
[P51]  That there was just three accidents that took place at the same time as these catastrophic winds. Could be. The most sinister version of it is that somebody wanted this to happen, maybe some mentally ill person. I know they did arrest... It's a sickness. It is a sick... Arsonists are... They're really sick people. And it's a known psychological illness. There's a guy that they arrested that was a known arsonist, several times arrested, who had a fake fire truck and drove down. I saw that. 
[P52]  Yeah. Drove down from Oregon to do who knows what. Can you imagine? Yeah. Well, there's. You got to be really, really sick. There's some psychos out there. Yeah.

主题：洛杉矶用水与火灾应对问题

输入内容：
[P40]  He collects these ancient, irreplaceable books. And then, of course, the loss of lives is horrifying. That issue is an issue that has plagued L.A. and California forever. So a big point of contention during the election, and even during the first Trump administration, was the use of water. And that water was being funneled into the Pacific Ocean. And now, apparently, you could tell me more. You probably know more than I do. 
[P41]  What has been done about that water? Because it seems like Trump has changed that. Well, I think what Trump did a good job of, first of all, I'm grateful for the fact that he flew out, had a meeting, and I'm grateful. And, you know, I have my differences time to time on some issues with him, but he sat down and he was forceful in a very strong way of holding the elected officials accountable, like get the people back in their homes now. 
[P42]  The fact that in this tragedy we've got a president who's also a builder who understands what needs to be done I think is great. And I hope he continues to hold all the elected officials accountable. He can make a big difference. And we need it. On the water issue, listen, I headed up Department of Water and Power, like I said, for 10 years. I have a pretty good understanding of the water issues. What's happening in the north really has not as much of an impact. 
[P43]  happening down in Southern California in terms of how the water gets transferred around. It doesn't mean we should be pouring water into the ocean. We should not be. We should be doing a lot of things. We should be collecting water. We should be holding water. We should be recycling water. We should be doing a lot of things. What happened in Los Angeles, which is just close to negligence, if not negligence, Joe, the fire hydrants ran out. We evacuated our home. 
[P44]  And we're in Brentwood, so you know the area. We're 15 minutes from the Palisades where the fire started. And it was my birthday. We were having family dinner. From the second floor, we saw the flames. We said, we're going to have to get out of here. The power went off. We said, we're out. Gathered the family. We moved down to a home we have in Newport Beach. 
[P45]  who sort of embedded in with the fire command post. And my heart dropped. He said, we just lost your daughter's home. And I said, oh my God, Banyan, how the hell did that happen? He said, you can't believe it. The hoses ran dry and the whole neighborhood went up. And I was so angry that Fox 11, the local Fox station was on with Alex Michelson. 
[P46]  And I texted him because they were reporting live. This is about 1030 at night. I said, are you getting reports that they've run out of water? He said, not at all. And I said, you need to report this. He said, do you want to come on live? I said, yeah, hook me up. And I went on. He couldn't believe it. And some of the media was trying to spin it. I saw that. Like it's not true. Yeah. And then they went right to the fireman. Went right to the fireman, right? Yeah. The fireman said, yeah, we're standing there, empty hoses. 
[P47]  How in God's name, the second largest city in the country, can you have a water system that runs out of water in a fire? And you knew this was coming, right? They gave warnings of catastrophic winds. The reservoir is empty over, I think it was 1.7 million gallons. I think it's 11 million. Maybe 11 million. Yeah. Probably right. It's empty during fire season. Yeah. You've got brush. 
[P48]  It hasn't been cleared for 40 years. There was a whole bunch of us raising hell about that after the fire in Brentwood six years ago. Nothing was done. The fire department wasn't pre-deployed, so there weren't engines staffed in different areas. You've got a fire department that's underfunded, and you've got fire equipment that's mothballed. And then the mayor flies to Ghana. And the mayor's out of town. So what should have been done, and who's responsible? 
[P49]  Well, I think the leadership is responsible at every level. I think the mayor is responsible for not being better prepared. I think she's certainly responsible for not staying in town. That's a lack of judgment. If you want to be a leader, the first thing you have to do is be present. I don't know what all the meetings that she had beforehand to make sure everybody was prepared. But years ago, the brush should have been cleared. Yes. Right. And you probably couldn't have prevented the fire. Maybe you couldn't have prevented the fire. Only God knows.

输入内容：
[P196]  the leadership that's there now. And the problem is now. Right. Right. So I got to figure out how I help the leadership be successful. Has the leadership adjusted their perspective based on this enormous failure of the fire? Because it seems like politically that's a giant handicap for them, right? Obviously, it was a huge disaster. So in order to get reelected, you have to give these people some faith that you've recognized that you've made some errors and you're going to do things differently. 
[P197]  I haven't heard that. I haven't heard that. Oh, that sounds crazy. Yeah. But, you know, I'll be really honest with you. I'm always honest with you, with everybody. When you're a leader and you weren't around to help prevent the problem, probably highly and likely you're going to be able to fix the problem if that was your judgment. Yeah. Right? Right. So if your judgment was, I'm going to go out of town when this catastrophic event is about to hit, 
[P198]  the city that I'm in charge of, you probably don't have the judgment to get it fixed. I hope I'm wrong. But I'm going to do whatever I can to help because the problem is bigger than the politics and the problem is bigger than her. And the people that are suffering shouldn't be suffering because of her or anything that she did or who she appointed that failed in their job. We've got to do a workaround.

主题：呼吁体制外人员解决城市问题

输入内容：
[P108]  Definitely make people feel safe that they're interacting with police officers. But respect these people. Respect these people that are protecting your life. That's right. Because all those people, when something goes down, they call 911. They're furious when cops don't show up. That's right. All these people who talk shit about the cops that are protected. Defund the police. You're protected by armed security people. Right. And you're saying defund the police. This is fucking nonsense. It's nonsense. Couldn't agree more. And for people that suffered because of this defund the police, 
[P109]  thing and this whole wave of crime that went through LA in the wake of it all, those people are the people that you can get to. The people that saw it, experienced it, know the consequences of this foolish direction that everything is going in, those are the people that you can still reach. And I think it could be reached with a person like you that is a compassionate, kind, liberal guy when it comes to social issues, but understands business and understands 
[P110]  like accountability and that you have to see positive results. You have to do what needs to be done to get those positive results. You can't just do the same shit over and over again and pay more people. And we need a bigger budget. You know, like, oh, let's raise the budget. We've increased the budget to fix the problem. You're not fixing it. It keeps getting bigger. It's just nuts. It needs someone outside the system. And that's why I was really happy to talk to you. And that's why I'm really happy that you're still involved. Because a lot of people like yourself that are 
[P111]  very wealthy and you don't have to do this. This is not going to be you're going to make money doing this. Like this is probably going to be a huge strain, a tremendous amount of pressure. But some people feel a calling and they feel like I think I can do something and fix this that other people maybe won't be able to do. I appreciate that. And I do. I do. Because what's the alternative? We stay in the same path. It gets worse. The alternative is it gets worse. It's going to get worse. And more and more people are leaving. More and more businesses

[P213]  Well, I'm optimistic, too. I am. We're going to get you back there. Good luck. I'm never leaving Texas. Okay. Fair enough. I'll never live in a big city again. I think you get too big. It's just people become a burden. I think there's a psychic aspect to it. Yeah. Just the mindset of living in a smaller place that's more relaxed. Yeah. It just feels better. I get it. Yeah. I get that, especially raising a family. Yes. 
[P214]  I did love living in L.A. I lived there for 25 years. I loved it. Yeah. I thought it was awesome. Had a great time there. You know, I still miss parts of it. I still miss the comedy store and I still miss, you know, there's there's amazing aspects to L.A. still. And there's an amazing group of human beings that live in L.A. still. It's an incredible city. Yeah. But the problem is. Everyone knew that it was amazing and everyone knew that everybody wanted to go there. And so they just sort of took everybody for granted. 
[P215]  And they said, look, let's just text the shit out of these people. They're staying. They're not going anywhere. It's California. Where are you going to go? That's right. There's still that attitude, by the way. Yes. Still that attitude. Yeah, that's what I felt. It doesn't work. That's what I felt. And that's what you hear from the governor and you hear from people when they brag about California. Instead of addressing why are people leaving, they talk about how great California is. Oh, we're kicking ass. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Still, but not as much as before. And there's a reason. You're on a downward trend. 
[P216]  It's the government. And not as much as we could. Yeah, not as much as we could. Well, listen, Rick, whatever you do, I wish you the best. Thank you, sir. I do hope you run for mayor again, and I hope you win this time, and I hope you can enact some of these ideas that you have, because I think they're very, very promising.

输入内容：
[P186]  decrease in all-cause mortality for people who use the sauna four days a week. Really? Yeah. More than an infrared? Just an old-fashioned dry sauna? It's just not more than an infrared. I think, look, infrared is definitely beneficial. I think the whole idea is heat shock proteins. The whole idea is raising your body temperature to the point where your body develops these heat shock proteins in order to mitigate the effects of the extreme heat. Because you can really only tolerate that extreme heat for a certain amount of time. A regular dry sauna gets 
[P187]  way hotter. So my sauna, I like to keep it at 196. So I get in there at 196 for 25 minutes. And it's not fun. It's not fun. It sucks. But that stress of doing that is what makes your body stronger. It's the response, your body's response to that extreme stress that makes it stronger. And this is what develops the heat shock proteins. And this is what is responsible for this. There's an EPO-like effect on 
[P188]  on your blood where you have more red blood cells. It raises your endurance. It's almost like static cardio. Even though you're sitting there, you know, I wear a heart rate monitor sometimes when I'm in there, and my heart's jacked up to 147 beats a minute at the end. I mean, it's pretty high. That's high, yeah. When you're hitting that 21-minute mark and you're looking at your watch going, oh, Jesus Christ, four more minutes of this shit. And then is your recovery quick once you get up, your heart rate's down? I'm so used to it. But another benefit is living in Texas. 
[P189]  When I go out in the heat and the sun, it doesn't bother me at all. My body's fully adapted to being hot. You know, it's just it's hot every day. And this just that's again, it's just voluntary adversity. It's forcing yourself to do something physically and it makes the rest of your day way easier. OK, so you should get into politics. Voluntary adversity. I would way rather have people like you on and try to help you out and get involved. I appreciate that. I'm grateful for that.

[P147]  Two Manhattans burned down. That's how big it is. Can you imagine that? That's insane. 14,000, 15,000 structures burned. It's so hard for people to imagine that. I just went back. Like I was telling you, I was there a couple weeks ago for the UFC. Yeah. And, you know, you see it. And when you're flying over, it just doesn't even make sense. Yeah. We showed the drone footage as well of the Palisades. It doesn't make sense. It's so much devastation. Altadena's gone. Gone. Gone. 
[P148]  You know, Altadena, my friend Jimmy Dore was just talking about this the other day in a video. It was this beautiful, like, nice neighborhood. Oh, yeah. Tree-lined streets. Yeah. Cottage homes. Dear, sweet neighborhood. And gone. Yeah, gone. One of the nice neighborhoods, like, a beautiful neighborhood to drive through. Yeah. It's gone. And those people mostly, Joe, as you know, so many of them, there's no safety net. Right. I mean, very moderate income. Right. 
[P149]  class, hardworking class people. And I've been telling all the elected officials, you've got to have programs that start supporting people because they are down and out. They have nowhere to go. And we've got to do something to help them, you know, day to day to live. One of the things that was bothering me was they were talking about replacing all those beautiful streets that were filled with single family homes with big apartment buildings. And then it would just 
[P150]  ruin that area. Can't do it. Yeah. Can't do it. It's wrong. Yeah. This is not the time to be reimagining anybody's neighborhood off the backs of the devastation and the pain. I've been really vocal about that. And this is, you know, this is the creep you get, what you're talking about, this social justice. Well, now let's say in the Palisades, let's start building a whole bunch of low-income housing. I'm all for low-income housing. I'm building workforce 
[P151]  housing for our employees that are low income because I want to make sure they have a home. So I'm all into that. But now is not the time to do it in a neighborhood that's been devastated. And there's also you're going to have people that won't be able to move back to their neighborhood because they may not be wealthy, but they may make more money than what is required to move into a low income apartment. They can't move back. Don't do that.

[P199]  option I've got right now. And that's what we're going to do. And that's what I'm going to do. Well, that's very practical. Is there anything else that you would think of that needs to be discussed about L.A. and that you think could be fixed? You know, we cover the regulations. Yeah. What about desalination? Absolutely should be done. Great idea. I tried it when I was the head of Department of Water and Power. Yeah. Got fought by every environmental group there is. Why? Do they think we're going 
[P200]  empty the entire ocean? It's crazy. There's so much water right there. It's crazy. First of all, we're dumping sewage. You know, there's tertiary treatment where water is potable. We dump sewage, secondary treatment. It doesn't hurt the ocean, but we're dumping it. Take it to tertiary treatment. Put it back in the natural underground aquifers and save it. Yeah. Right? That could be done. The abundance of water that goes into the ocean. 
[P201]  It's sort of what you start out with. Desal, brilliant. Absolutely. We should be doing it. We should have desal plants supporting Los Angeles and big parts of Southern California. Also, it creates jobs. It creates jobs. You can do it where it's environmentally safe. Absolutely. And it has a redundancy of power that comes off of it also that's helpful because we've got a power shortage in California. Absolutely. 
[P202]  know how to supply right now. And again, back in the day... How does it work as a redundancy of power? Well, because you've got to generate a lot of power for the decel. When the decel is not operating, you've still got an operating power plant there. So you can skew up the operation in order to have additional energy coming off your decel plant. Okay. And... You've got to build a power plant to decel because of the amount of power it consumes to clean the water. And how much water, 
[P203]  could be desalinated. Like, how much of an impact can that actually have? Does it depend upon the size of the plant and how many of them there are? It depends on the size of the plant. You can, yeah, depends on the size of the plant. So, ideally, they should be set up, though, like at various intervals along the coast, and you'd probably fix the entire, I mean, California could be completely green. Well, listen, it could be, but it's also, you mix sources of water. Like, right now, in L.A., I'll just take L.A., you've got, 
[P204]  The aqueduct that's bringing water down that William Mulholland built at the turn of the century, right? He was brilliant on how he did it. There isn't one pump. It's all gravity flow that comes down from Inyo County, Owens Valley comes down. There was a whole bunch of controversy and everything, but all of that has sort of been fixed. That water comes down. There's some water that comes down from the state. There's water that Los Angeles has natural aquifers we pump, right? 
[P205]  And then you add decel to it. Then you have one more supply that's backing up supply. And then, of course, you want to capture rainwater, which we do a terrible job of. We let it go in the ocean. We don't capture as much rainwater in Los Angeles as we should. Probably not much at all. But even with the sewage, why wouldn't you just spend the investment and take the treatment and put it back in the aquifer and have clean water? Yeah. 
[P206]  supply. All we're doing now is we're dumping it in the ocean. Yeah, it's very stupid. And again, it's doing the same thing you've always done and hoping for a different result. Yeah. What was the pushback from the idea of desalination plants? Because there's a long line of thinkers that there should be no power plants along the coast of California because of the emissions. So years ago, when I was president of DWP, under Tom Bradley's leadership at the time, converted all the old 
[P207]  oil plants on the coast to gas, to be clean. There's better technology now. You know, you can convert those. They're testing out hydrogen and convert them to hydrogen plants. There's a big plant that DWP built in Utah when I was president called Intermounter Power Project. It was the cleanest coal-burning plant in the country at the time. This is probably, you know, 25 years ago now, 30 years ago. They're now testing and converting it to hydrogen, 
[P208]  which will be absolutely clean. That's smart, right? So we need- Literally makes oxygen. Right. Yeah. We need more- The question is, how do you boil water? Pick your source. That's what a plant does. A plant boils water, creates steam, spins a turbine, you got electricity. Right. So whatever kind of fuel you want, we built- We were partners in Palo Verde, which is the nuclear plant in Arizona. We need more nuclear plants in this country. Yeah, I was going to get to that.

[P82]  got the freedom to make a decision without worrying about getting reelected. It's probably where the president's head is. I'm just going to do what I think is right. It really is amazing what can happen. So let's get more people like that who just understand. Let's do what's right for people. I'm in public service. Serve the damn people. It almost seems like at this pretty simple you need someone who's outside of politics to to run for office. 
[P83]  I think you do. I know that sounds self-serving, but I think you do. Of course, it would sound self-serving coming from someone who wants you outside of it and wanted to be the mayor. But I think that's the correct response because the people that are in it are just too tied in. They're too tied in. They're too beholding. They're too beholding. It's entwined. The octopus has many tentacles. It's wrapped around everything. And it just stalls all progress and change. And no real radical change. 
[P84]  Change can ever be met. No one wants to go with it because it's going to disrupt all their different ideas and businesses. And people are going to look like they're responsible or incompetent. So they don't want change. They want to pretend that this is the only way to go forward. And then if someone does come along and changes things radically, I mean, it makes them all look terrible. And it's dangerous. It's dangerous for business. They're not in the business of helping people. They're in the business of keeping their job. 100%. Yeah. And that's what's gross. 
[P85]  gross. And it's gross. And it seems like the only way that that ever gets resolved is you have to bring in someone who's a businessman or a businesswoman, someone who understands business, who's outside of this political system and says, I've studied this for years. There's a lot of things that could be fixed and they're not being done and we could do it. Yeah. And you know, the issue with that is it's such a tough system. There's so much that gets thrown at you. Yeah. Like the whole entire party of 
[P86]  Democrats came to go after you. I know. And I was a Democrat. I'm very moderate. Yeah. You know, I'm fiscally very conservative. I'm socially liberal. But they were – so, you know, what gives the incentive to the person on the outside to do it? Right. Nothing. And that's what we've got to figure out. Listen, I've got high hopes for San Francisco with their new mayor. Again, an outsider came in and won. I think that's great. I hope he does great. I hope he does too.

[P73]  It doesn't matter. Are you competent? Do you have experience? Are you going to make decisions for the right reason? When I was the president of the police commission, it was the most amazing experience because Jim Hahn's mayor, we have a police department that was failing miserably after the Rodney King riots. The police department was under a federal consent decree. A federal judge was overseeing it. 
[P74]  We had Bernie Parks, who was the chief of police. I don't know if you remember Bernie Parks. He was probably there when you were living there. He came out of central casting. Very handsome, proud black man and wore the uniform beautifully, rose through the ranks. Super nice guy. We were friends. Jim Hunt calls me and says, hey, I want to appoint you as a president of the police commission. And I said, Mr. Mayor, I really appreciate it, but I don't want the job because I knew what the job was going to entail. 
[P75]  potentially having to fire a very, very popular chief of police. And he's two or three times called back. I finally did it. So glad I did because I learned so much from the experience. At the end of the day, decided we needed to move on and have a different chief of police. What was wrong? What was he doing? What he was doing, Joe, is he had put in procedures, discipline procedures that were so onerous on, 
[P76]  the officers, that one, officers were leaving. But more importantly, the bad guys, particularly the gangs, were very smart that they would start filing complaints in certain areas that they wanted to control around the city. And so the officers started getting all these complaints on their record. And once they did, it held up any kind of promotion or transfer. So what did the cops 
[P77]  not going to go to that area. And the minute they abandoned that area, the gangs controlled it and crime was going crazy. How clever. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So I would go to the chief and say, come on, you got to change the discipline process. Nope. Not changing a thing. Very stubborn guy. He had all the answers, but yeah. And I don't mean that. It's facetious. He didn't have all the answers, obviously. But so that was a main problem. So if you had an area of the city that bordered 
[P78]  L.A. County. L.A. City crime was rising. L.A. County was going down because the sheriffs were actually proactively and not in an abusive way, proactively policing. LAPD was retreating. Cops were upset. Cops were leaving. The academy is empty. All of these things were happening. I had to change leadership. I had people burning me in effigy, literally. My wife would call me and say, oh, my God, they're burning you outside of City Hall. They're marching. 
[P79]  It was crazy to put pressure on me to keep Bernie Parks, not because Bernie Parks was the best chief of police, because it was politically correct to do that. And I remember calling Jimmy Hahn, the mayor, and I said, I'm going to make a recommendation and you're probably not going to like it because you're going to come under a lot of heat. And to his credit, he said, just do what's right. I'll take the heat. And I recommended we hire Bill Bratton. 
[P80]  guy in to LA, his Boston accent and all, best cop in the country, built a team around him. We got crime down to levels not seen since 1950, doing all the right things, engaging the community, senior lead officers, walking the beat, getting to know the neighborhoods, started hiring. People wanted to be a member of LAPD. There was now back a pride in it. 
[P81]  completely turned it around within a couple of years. But that all came, and then Jimmy lost re-election because the black community unfortunately abandoned him because of not keeping Bernie Parks. It's one of the reasons. But he did the right thing. He didn't care about his political future. He cared about the city. He never gets enough credit for this. And I just learned that lesson, which I talked about earlier.

[P63]  I think the reality has set in, honestly, and it's unfortunate it's taken this, but the reality really has set in that you've got to have competent leadership. Yes. And what happened at DWP, because I was there for 13 years, 10 of which I was president, or close to 10, is the head of that department got politicized. 
[P64]  Years ago under Bradley and under Reardon, under Hahn, the general manager of the Department of Water and Power was always somebody who came through the ranks, who was just this exceptional engineer. And that department was regarded as best in class in the country as a utility, bar none. The best financial rating, the best engineers wanted to work there. It built some of the most amazing projects in history, including Hoover Dam. So let's just start with that one, right? 
[P65]  Then what happened? Politics creeped into who was the general manager. That destroys an organization. This is an organization that's not in the business of being necessarily doing what's politically important at the time. It's in the business of delivering water and power. And the failure is also there. 
[P66]  I don't know what she did and didn't do. But the kind of failure that's on her desk where the buck stops, she needs to resign. She needs to be fired, in my opinion, by the mayor and be held accountable for whoever made bad decisions, including herself. But we're allowing this. And so the minute you allow that, that continues this creep of incompetence is tolerated. 
[P67]  it shouldn't be tolerated because people lost their lives. They lost their homes. Right? Am I right about that? You're 100% right. And I think you're 100% right about politics. And the problem with politics is that people want to preserve the structure that pays them. They want to preserve the entity that they're invested in, that they have their time in, they have all their connections. And this is the weird world of politics versus the world of business.

Because, you know, we're very sensitive in L.A. that bad things don't get in our water. So they have to keep all these reservoirs covered, which in general I get. I get the safety of that. But how about this? You know that you have catastrophic winds coming. 
[P55]  in the water. Yeah. When you need it in your fire hydrant. Yeah. Right? That could have been done in probably a couple of weeks. Whatever it took. Yeah. And it's not like we don't know. L.A. has fire season. I remember every year because where I used to live in Bell Canyon is, you know, it's about 35 minutes from L.A. Right. And it gets rough out there. It's like a lot of like big rolling hills and it gets all filled with grass. And if it catches and the winds start whipping through those canyons, the winds in California for people to 
[P56]  don't know, every year we get the Santa Ana winds. That's right. And they're crazy. They are crazy. Some of them were 100 miles an hour this year. That is just, if you've ever been out there for that, that's nuts. And if there's fires blowing, boy. No, it's a terrible combination. I mean, the early settlers called them the devil winds. They've been there forever. Forever. To your point, they've been there forever. So just think about, you know, had the brush been cleared, had the reservoirs been full, had the fire trucks been stationed, 
[P57]  And had there been a whole series of protocols in place, again. We could have saved some houses. We could have saved a lot of lives, a lot of houses, a lot of jobs, a lot of pain. A lot of pain. Yeah. Yeah. So that's just incompetence. There's no way you could say, oh, I see why they didn't do that. Oh, I see why they didn't have the resources. Oh, it's not their fault. No, there's none of that there. No one's saying that. That's right. Everyone is saying it's a failure.

[P4]  battleship around? Because it's a big battleship. It's a big battleship. And people will argue that the mayor of L.A. doesn't have a lot of authority like other mayors. You know, I learned a lot, Joe. I worked for three mayors. I worked for Tom Bradley when I was in my mid-20s as a commissioner. I was the head of Department of Water and Power. I worked for Dick Reardon. He brought me back into head of DWP during the energy crisis. The department was under a lot of financial strain. 
[P5]  Tim Hunt, who brought me in to turn around LAPD, and I was the police commissioner, the head of the police commission. So I've seen really good leadership. And honestly, what we've had in the last two mayors is not good leadership, and we're paying a price for it. So you may not have a lot of power, but actually, I think the most powerful thing you can have that I learned as a police commissioner, if you're not worried about getting reelected or reappointed, it's really amazing what can happen. 
[P6]  Make decisions that are actually in the best interest of the people. And I believe the career politicians are always worried about getting reelected. They are scared to death of getting a real job. They've never had to sign the front of a check, only the back. So it's very difficult for them to even think about being out of office. So they just circulate. You know, they go from the city council to the state assembly to the state senate. 
[P7]  That look and feel of leadership, which is pretty weak. I think Dick Rudin was a good example of a guy who came in and did a lot of great stuff. I actually think Jimmy Hahn did a lot of great stuff as mayor. So I would go in there with some strong leadership. I would certainly go in there and reach across the aisle and find common ground and all of those things you need to do to move forward. But I would certainly plant some really strong goals that everybody knew we were working towards. 

[P10]  both immigrants. My, my grandfather, paternal grandfather was a gardener in Los Angeles. He lived in Boyle Heights. He started as a, as a coal miner. He actually probably had one of the worst jobs you could ever have in life. When he immigrated here to a little town called Uniontown, Pennsylvania, he was the dynamiter. He was the guy that had to go in the lead. Oh boy. Yeah. Set the dynamite and get the hell out in time. And his brother who immigrated with him said, come to LA. It's sunny. My, my dad was actually 
[P11]  born in a coal mining camp outside the coal mine. But anyway, he was a gardener out here. And we actually grew up in his truck as he would go around. And they had this small little home they rented in Boyle Heights. And I think about what L.A. gave to my grandparents, to my dad, to me, my family, the opportunity to build a business.

[P140]  blueprint to the city of LA and say, you know, here's the 10 things you need to do. And it should only take, I mean, that's what we're doing. This new foundation I launched with a bunch of really smart thought leaders in industry have come together. We launched it yesterday just to go tackle problems. Don't tell me what the problem is without the solution. You know, I just live by that. And there is a solution to every problem. It may not be the solution you want, but there's a solution out there. So work towards it. 
[P141]  And I'll give you an example. You know, I've been pushing since the fires. We've got to underground all the power lines. You can't go rebuild the Palisades or Altadena the way it was built 70 years ago. Right. It'd be insane. It's insane. So underground the power lines, redo the water mains, redo the higher fighter system, blah, blah, blah. And I get this pushback. We don't have the money. We don't have the time. You just had the largest urban disaster in the history of the United States. 
[P142]  billion dollars worth of damage, and you're telling me you don't have the money to do the right thing? Didn't we just have the largest infrastructure bill in history passed about a year ago? We must have the money, and we'll find the money, but that can't stop you from doing what's right. So this organization I put together is to go be the advocate for those homeowners, to be the advocate for those business people that lost their businesses, and work alongside 
[P143]  government and say, listen, we'll solve the problem for you and hand the blueprint to you. And then we're going to hold you accountable to implement it. What is the answer when they say we don't have the money? If you have California, which is just insanely enormous economy and a very high tax rate. One of the highest. That's right. So you have high taxes. So you have an enormous economy. That means you've got a lot of money. Right. So where's the money going? Where the money's gone, I can't tell you. 
[P144]  surplus in California. Now we have a deficit. So if that happens at your home or my home, that means we mismanaged our money. It's pretty simple. Yeah. In solving the problem for the Palisades or Altadena on the electric issues or the infrastructure issues, listen, the city has bonding authority. Department of Water and Power has bonding authority. There's federal grants. There's state grants. There's private capital. We're going to go solve that and give some answers to the 
[P145]  But my point is the answer can't be let's not do what's right. We've done enough of that. The answer has to be we're going to go do this and now we're going to solve how to pay for it. And we're going to do it quickly to get people back in their homes and start building again. And I believe we can bend the curve. If somebody thinks it's going to take five years, let's go figure out how we get it done in two years. This is where private enterprise needs to come in and help the government. 
[P146]  because the government alone can't fix this problem. It's too big. They work too slow. You need innovation and entrepreneurship that private enterprise brings. We saw that in COVID with Project Warp Speed and getting the medicines that were needed at the time. We saw it at 9-11 on getting the rebuilding done. And we need to implement the same thing in Los Angeles to get the city rebuilt because it's an impact on the American economy to have the size of two Manhattans.

输入内容：
[P209]  this state, you know, hasn't been aggressive in building more clean burning plants because we need them. Nuclear has a negative stereotype in the public eye, unfortunately, because of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, because of Fukushima. People think nuclear, they think disaster. They think terrible waste. You can't get away from it. It pollutes the ground forever. But it can be made very safe. But it can be made much safer and much cleaner. 
[P210]  And it's not being done because we're – and then also people have to understand that if you go back to the cars that were on the road at the time these nuclear power plants were built, those cars were polluting like crazy. You got a brand new car. The emissions are far less. Or you get a Tesla. You have none. Right? So like why would we look at the same old architecture of these – like the Fukushima one is a prime example. It only had one backup generator. 
[P211]  went out, they were done. They have them now where they can actually shut them down. There's new designs. Oh, yeah. And listen, Palo Verde, again, is probably 20 or 30 years old. It's been an incredibly performing plant. Never has had a problem. So, again, this is where you sort of get into what your point is. Get somebody from the outside who's thinking big, who's thinking outside the box, who wants to change the landscape for the better way of having 
[P212]  a quality of life and is willing to think big. And you're going to get kicked in the head sometimes. And not every idea is going to make sense and work. But you only get there if you throw enough good ideas out on the table that you figure things out, right? And so when you take a look at Los Angeles, when you take a look at California, I'm hopeful that you get leadership that just starts looking at things differently and will make some small moves that turns into big changes. So we'll see. Again, I'm optimistic about it.

[P152]  that. That's not fair. If you want to do that, what I've told the elected officials is provide an incentive, not a requirement. If you build some low-income units in an apartment building you're replacing, let me back up. So we have this crazy law in the city of Los Angeles. The crazy law in the city of Los Angeles is something to this effect. I may not get it exactly right. If you tear down an existing apartment building that's market rate, 
[P153]  you have to replace it with low-income housing. Okay. All of it? Maybe it's not all of it. I think it's the majority of it. But whatever the number is, okay? My point is when you do that, you provide a disincentive to reinvest in the city. Yeah. So let's turn it around and provide an incentive. Say if you close, knock it down and rebuild, or it's burned down in the Palisades and want to rebuild, 
[P154]  bonus density and allow that person to build more to compensate them for providing housing that is low income, right? It just seems to be more fair. How would you do that? How does that work? Well, let's say you have a 12-unit apartment building that burnt down in the Palisades. Instead of requiring low-income housing for, let's say, 20%, 30%, 40% of it, say instead of building 12, we're going to let you build 20 units. And out of the 20 units, give us 
[P155]  units that are low-income housing, whatever the numbers are. But let's have governments start thinking about an incentive-based system, right? I mean, you look at your life or my life or the people that work here, the harder you work, the more that you do, you're more rewarded, right? You're not required to work harder. You're incentivized to work harder or work smarter. And I think if we build that kind of thinking into government, 
[P156]  to provide capital, to provide investment, especially on the rebuilding, you can have some social policies that are very important and very good, like low income. What I would even say is, why don't we give an incentive to build workforce housing in the Palisades and Altadena, where the workforce housing goes to the first responders, firefighters, police, and teachers? 
[P157]  they're serving. As you know, L.A. is so expensive, most of the cops drive two hours to get home and two hours to get to work. Same with the firefighters. You want them to be in the neighborhood they serve. That's a great public policy. Do it around an incentive. Especially in a place like the Pacific Palisades, I think people deeply resent the idea of being forced to have any kind of low-income housing. The idea is that it's hard to live in the Palisades. It's expensive. It's beautiful. It's an incredible piece of land. 
[P158]  or it was before the fires devastated it. It was a glorious place to live. And it was very difficult to afford to live there. So the people that made the most money were the ones who could buy the homes there. They don't want someone to open up low-income housing in the same neighborhood that's very difficult to live in. The whole idea is that you make enough money where you could live in a place that's very difficult to live in, but it's beautiful and it's really safe. And that's what the Palisades was. They don't want this to be replaced with low-income housing. 
[P159]  housing. They don't want incentives for it to be replaced with low-income housing. Yeah, I don't know, Joe. I think there's people, I think there's a lot of people that would be very excited to have workforce housing, especially if you tie your workforce housing into first responders. And I think there's people that would allow... That's different, though. That's different than apartment buildings. Yeah, but even in an apartment setting, I think it can work. I mean, listen, I think there's people in the Palisades that would very much welcome 
[P160]  affordable housing, low-income housing. I certainly wouldn't. I'm a big landowner in the Palisades. But what I don't like about it is the requirement off the backs of people who have lost everything. That's just not right. That's not the time to do it. If you want to go rezone stuff, let the place get rebuilt and let people get back on their feet and then go have that discussion. It's a timing issue on it, in my opinion. But listen, there's a lot of issues the city's got to tackle to get these places.

[P28]  down there and spend time during the campaign. And since then, because we've been supportive of their efforts as a family, they actually welcome people as they are. No judgment. Downtown Women's Center. Tonight in Los Angeles, there'll be about 20,000 women that will go to sleep on the street. And the majority of those women will in some form or fashion be abused, sexually abused, right? It's terrible that we allow this. It's a crime we allow this. But an example of Downtown Women's Center, 
[P29]  They accept them the way they are, mental health condition, drug addiction condition. They have embedded services downtown in their facility. They have housing there for them, and they give them the treatment. And it's happening in real time. And they're very effective doing it. Like I said, they've got about a 90% success rate. So they have highly educated, skilled workers that know how to react and deal with the people on the street. That's what we need more of. 
[P30]  I don't think you need to build new big institutions. What I do think you need to do is cut all the red tape, start building quickly, funding these organizations, and fund them quickly. If you talk to Downtown Women's Center, it will take them an average of six years to build new housing. Six years. That's crazy. It's crazy. And it's in Skid Row. It's not like you're building in a sensitive environmental area. Right. Right? Right. Give the damn permits. 
[P31]  and say go. I first encountered Skid Row when we used to film Fear Factor downtown. And I'd heard of it. I had no idea. And we were driving. We had done a bunch of the Fear Factor stunts in abandoned buildings. It makes good backdrops. Sure. Creepy. And when I went there, one time I took a wrong turn. And I went right into the meat of everything. And I was like, this is insanity. And this was 2004? 2003? 
[P32]  So this was 20 years ago, 22 years ago. And even back then it was bananas. Come see it now. Oh, I've heard. Well, we watched that documentary. Is it the Carlisle Hotel, Jamie? I think so. One of the documentaries on one of the old downtown hotels. And it went into the history of Skid Row. And what Skid Row was, they would take people, they would arrest them for being vagrants somewhere else, and they'd bring them to Skid Row and just leave them there and basically box them in and leave them in this area. 
[P33]  They had, you know, soup kitchens and places where they could get food and they were allowed to just sleep on the street. And so they just stayed there. And so they essentially, instead of fixing this problem of homeless people and mentally ill people, they just pushed them into this one area. They said, let's just, you know, we got a spot. We could just stick them. We could turn our back on it. And then, of course, every business in that area got devastated. All those hotels, glorious old classic hotels. I mean, in fact, the Morrison Hotel just caught fire because vagrants were living in it. 
[P34]  And it's gone now. So these methods that these people are using that are successful, what are they? What are they doing? Well, what they're doing is they're giving them the treatment they need. Now, Union Rescue Mission has a different approach. Union Rescue Mission, you know, that's a faith-based organization. Hugely successful. It's overflowing. They can't accommodate everybody. They need a lot more funding. But they don't allow anybody to use drugs or alcohol the minute they check in. 
[P35]  get an apartment. The other organizations that I'm aware of allow them to continue that, but they're required to go on programs to get off the drugs, to get the mental health care that they need. So they have skilled workers. They're literally daily classes. There's protocols. There's requirements of the residents on what they can do and what they can't do. To give them structure. They give them structure. That's right. That's a great word. You're exactly right. They give them structure. They give them training. They give them hope. And they give them a path forward.

[P1] ﻿ Good to see you, sir. Thanks for having me. My pleasure. Thanks for being here. It is a terrible time for Los Angeles. And unfortunately, you did not win. I wanted you to win. Thank you. I was rooting for you. Thank you. It's just the politics in L.A. are it's almost like watching people. 
[P2]  who are in a cult who are being confronted by the cult experts who are telling them, hey, this is all crazy and fake and you're ruining your life. And they're like, no, no, no, I think it's going to work out. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of things that aren't working out. Yeah. There's a lot of things that are. I mean, listen, I know like you spending time and living in L.A., it's an amazing city. It's amazing. And when I ran for office, as much as I loved L.A., I actually fell in love with it more 
[P3]  I got to see places that I wouldn't normally see. And so it was really amazing. And people and the diversity and the dearness of so many neighborhoods and people. But what's happened to L.A. over the last decade is just tragic. And people are paying huge consequences for it. And it's sad to watch. So if you get to the heart of it, like if you did, if you won and you became the mayor of L.A., 

[P8]  I believe that you either lead, follow, or get out of the way. And I really admire people who lead. And I wouldn't mind being a little bit controversial if it's in the interest of doing what's in the best interest of the residents. Well, that's what I enjoyed about your campaign, and that's what I was really hopeful about, is that it seemed like you were not running for mayor because you wanted to be the mayor. You were running for mayor because you're a businessman, and you realized that this was not being run like a successful business. 
[P9]  You knew how to run a successful business. You knew the difference. And L.A. is just constantly plagued by this crony political movement. The same people, same type of people shuffling in and out. And it's just nothing ever changes. Yeah. And again, to give you a little bit of background, I am so indebted to L.A. It sounds a little bit corny, but, you know, my paternal and maternal grandparents, 

[P12]  to the city that gave me so much. And by the way, all the problems that we've got, you can fix them with a little bit of backbone, a little bit of smarts. If you're equipped right, bring together some really smart people. You can fix everything. And to your point, what happened when I was tied at the end of the race and actually a little bit ahead? You know, Biden flies into campaign. Kamala flies into campaign. Pelosi, Bernie. 
[P13]  And at the end of the day, when we're 10 days before Election Day, they finally convinced Obama to do a message. And so the system is so it's a closed loop. Right. And the idea that somebody was going to come in the tent that's an outsider was horrifying to them. And, you know, we would laugh about it as a family. It's like you might as well just load up Air Force One all at one time and bring everybody out.

[P125]  people peeing on themselves and throwing up and walking through the streets just covered in cardboard shelters and tents. That's not hope. You're not seeing good examples. So what are you depending on for your examples? That's a travesty. That should be cleaned up immediately. So let's talk about that. What could be done for Skid Row, which is probably the worst example of LA's homeless problem? 
[P126]  It's the same thing with any place else that we talked about. You have to, I believe, supercharge these organizations like Aparo Los Ninos that are doing well, that are really changing lives, like the Downtown Women's Center, like Common Concern. There's Union Rescue Mission. There's dozens of them. Where do you put all those people? You've got all these people on the streets. You've got 100,000 people on the streets. There's endless land. There's endless land. The city of Los Angeles has something like over 300 or 400 parcels of land 
[P127]  Vacant. They're just sitting there vacant. Densify them. Build on them. Build housing. Absolutely do it. Skid Row, there's a lot of opportunity to do that and a lot of organizations that will do that. But we can never say, well, create enterprise zones. I mean, I wanted to create enterprise zones. You go to South L.A. or whatnot, there's areas that they were burned out years ago from the riots that have never been rebuilt. 
[P128]  and give tax incentives to go down there and build housing. The tax code, when I was a young lawyer, they changed all the tax laws. They had a lot of tax credits, a lot of incentives to do things. It's a great way to incentivize businesses, mobilize the private financial markets to invest and do things. There's an enormous amount of capital in this country. We're the wealthiest country in the world. Especially L.A. L.A. is so wealthy. State of California, fifth largest economy in the world, 
[P129]  We have an economy larger than India. It's nuts. It's nuts. And do we have problems? Of course. Can you imagine if we fixed the problems, what this state could do? It would be incredible. There's nothing like it. And so I think we just have to have some really basic goals of how we're going to change things little by little, start attacking them, but start getting people off the streets, 
[P130]  Start building. Start giving the incentives to do it. Break some eggs as you're doing it because you're saving lives. And I think once you get that in motion, it starts taking off. I really do. Because people do not want to continue the way we're continuing. And if there's a handful of people that do, who cares? God bless them. Leave them there. But that's not the far majority of the people. I think those handful of people are fed a narrative.

[P112]  close down. But here's what really hit me on the campaign. And I was telling our family, I've got four kids and they're 35 to 25 and just incredible people. And my wife is wonderful. I'm really incredibly blessed with all of that. I was so worried when I decided to run for mayor, the impact on the family, right? A little bit scary, high profile, all these kinds of things. It ended up being the greatest experience. And we would go into neighborhoods, hardworking neighborhoods, 
[P113]  of people that just wanted the ability to work hard and live their life, that would just want the ability to allow their daughter to be able to walk to school on her own and not have to walk around an encampment or for fear that there'd be somebody that would attack her on the way to school. Right. The most basic things. And we'd give them a hug. You know, they would cry. We would cry. And I would tell the kids that cry is hope. 
[P114]  we're seeing there is for the first time, there's actually somebody coming into their neighborhood, a neighborhood that historically doesn't vote in large chunks. So the politicians forget about them, right? Because they're not likely voters necessarily. But we were trying to mobilize it. And we were also trying to give a voice to people that don't have a voice. How inspiring that was for me. That's what fueled me. And you're right. I don't, 
[P115]  want a career as a politician. I want a career of being able to give back and help and take the group of people that have the least voice but are some of the hardest working people of our society and give them an opportunity to grow. That was my grandfather as an immigrant, as a gardener. But he had the opportunity to raise his family where he didn't have to worry about all this shit. 
[P116]  It's just changed so much. So I believe we've got to get our elected officials. If we take people who are the hardest working, the dearest people that have the most impact because of crime, because of homelessness, because of being overly taxed, all of these kind of things, and we give them hope and a path forward, everybody benefits from it. You start solving so many problems, Joe.

[P23]  You can't have open drug dealing on the streets. We welcome it. And if you look around MacArthur Park, the great old Langer's Deli, and the poor owner, Norm Langer's, who basically said, after 70 years, I've got to close my restaurant. It's terrible. Terrible. Amazing old place. And then, you know, Mayor Bass promised, I'm going to be down there. I'm going to clean it up. We're going to fix it. It hasn't changed in six months since she said that. It can be cleaned up. It can be fixed. You've got to have some backbone. 
[P24]  A lot of it is a mental health issue, correct? Very much so. Probably half. And drug addiction. Drug addiction, a lot of that comes from mental health issues as well, right? Yes. So what could be done? I mean, you're dealing with an enormous population of people that have this issue. It's probably closer to 100,000 in L.A. County. Maybe. I mean, that's the high estimates, right? So let's say 70,000 to 100,000 people. You have a lot of people. 
[P25]  results with helping these people with their mental health issues and helping these people with their drug addiction issues. I think you start first by enforcing the law and don't allow the sale of drugs on the street and holding the drug dealers accountable. Not just the sale, but the open use. I mean, meth, cooking meth right out in front of everybody. You're right, all the above. I mean, literally in downtown, there's tents that are run by the drug dealers where everybody knows to go to get their drugs. So you got to start there. 
[P26]  But I'm a big believer that government alone can't solve major problems, right? Right. And you've got organizations downtown that are really doing great stuff. Downtown Women's Center is doing great stuff. Union Rescue Mission, great stuff. And they're bringing people in. They're giving them the help and the treatment they need for drug addiction and mental health care. And they're giving them housing. Scale those people up. Take the dollars we're spending and wasting on the city trying to do it. 
[P27]  And start pushing dollars to organizations that have a proven track record of success. And their success, Joe, is like a 90% success rate. And scale it. Why go reinvent a model that's already working well? And there's probably a dozen organizations downtown that are doing a good job. And what are they doing? And you do it at a fraction of the cost. I already interrupted you. Do it at a fraction of the cost. These people that are being successful, how are they doing it? What's their method?

[P97]  about law and order. That's a giant issue in Los Angeles. People do not feel as safe as they used to feel. They feel like there's more violent crime. It's more unreported crime. And maybe more concerning is that people get arrested and then immediately get released. Right. And there doesn't seem to be any repercussions for that. Right. So what would you do to change that? Well, thank goodness state law got changed. I mean, that's another really good example of what happened in California, that they repealed the law 
[P98]  Right. 
[P99]  chance to rebuild their lives. No doubt. It goes hand in hand. But we made a big change by getting rid of George Gascon as our district attorney, who was not prosecuting and allowing people. It was just a turnstile. You got arrested. You were let out. Can we get to the heart of that? Sure. What's the motivation for that? Motivation for doing that? Yes. Well, I probably won't explain it right because I don't agree with it. 
[P100]  is that from a social justice standpoint, quote unquote, you don't want to overpopulate the prisons. You don't want to hold people and take away their life for a minor crime. But a lot of it wasn't minor crimes. A lot of it wasn't minor crimes. There was one of them that was a guy who was this crazy homeless guy who pulled a knife on a sheriff. And then two weeks later, at least somewhere a little short time after that, I don't know if it's two weeks, attacked a man with his family with a machete on the beach. 
[P101]  Yeah. No, I know. You're right. You're right. I mean— So that's a violent criminal? Yeah, you're right. You're absolutely right. And I can't explain it because it's just—it's so messed up. I don't even know how you justify letting somebody out of jail or not holding them with bail, any of that. I don't understand it. I think most people got to the point they were so worried about where crime was going, they did finally get rid of George. And we brought in Nathan Hockman, and I think Nathan's doing a great job. 
[P102]  So I can't explain it. But the fear is that it's done on purpose. This is the fear. Oh, of course it is. 
[P103]  People live in a constant state of fear. And what's the end goal of that? It has to be profit. I mean, someone has to be profiting off of it. Who profits off of that? I don't know. Ask George Soros. Yeah, right. Ask the people that fund these extremely liberal district attorneys that all seem to have the same idea. But do you think that tide is turning? No cash bail. I do. I do think that tide is turning. And I know that Elon Musk wants to do sort of the exact opposite. He's been talking about that. Financing people that are much more reasonable. 
[P104]  believe in law and order. Well, Nathan is a good example of that. I mean, that's great. We need fair laws. We need, we need kind justice. We need, we do need rehabilitation, but we also need to protect people that aren't criminals. Of course. That's the primary thing is protect the general public, serve and protect, right? That's the whole idea. We need to protect everybody else. And then the people that were life did them wrong and they've wound up like, let's figure out a way to actually rehabilitate them instead of just putting them in cages. Yeah. And people are doing that. I mean, there's some very successful programs. 
[P105]  that are doing that. But I agree with you. I mean, we got to get back to the point where government's primary function is to protect the public and give them the ability to prosper, give them the ability to build a business, raise your family, keep your community safe. It's just so basic. It's so basic. It's gone upside down. Yeah. That's what's crazy is that law and order thrown out the window. Without law and order, no one is safe. You don't understand that if you just don't go after bad people, then they have no 
[P106]  fear of doing whatever they want. And then you're letting them out on jail. So out of jail. So then you've got more of them out than ever before. There was a podcast that I listened to where there was a former gang member who was talking about how they're going to let 70,000 hard criminals out of the L.A. jails. And he's like, I'm getting out of town. This guy was a hardcore gang member. He's like, L.A. is going to get too crazy in the next year. It's just nuts. And, you know, there was the whole defund the police movement, which was just catastrophic. 
[P107]  That whole – and seeing politicians, including Kamala Harris, seeing politicians openly say and post it on Twitter, we need to defund the police, which is just crazy. It is as wrong as it can be. Yeah. Certainly hold bad cops accountable. Certainly have better training. Yeah. Certainly have higher standards. Yeah. But defunding the police, like what are you talking about? You need to do the opposite. That's right. You need to train them better. Refund them. Right. 100%.

[P161]  rebuilt. It's immensely complicated. And again, I mean, I'll be very honest. The government just cannot do it alone. There's just no way. There's just no way. One of the things that people complain a lot about California is regulations. Yeah. And how regulated it is and how difficult it is to start businesses and to maintain businesses. Hugely over-regulated. What can be done about that? Cut through the red tape. We have more regulations. It's insane to run a business. I run a business. 
[P162]  obviously in LA and in California. And it's to the point that you would never, I would never restart the business in LA and in California. It's too expensive. The tax rates are too high for everybody, not just people that are making money. I'm talking about people who are, you know, moderate, hardworking people. Tax rates too high. But the regulation on small businesses in Los Angeles, you have businesses now closing because of it's over-regulated. And then it got even, 
[P163]  frankly, worse post-COVID, because a lot of the restrictions they took away during COVID in order to allow businesses to survive and restaurants to operate, they started taking them away, like just having outdoor dining. Like, why would you do that? Why would you make it more difficult for a small business owner to operate a restaurant? So that gets back to, like, the business approach to running government. Let people prosper. Have a system. There's certain laws you need, obviously, 
[P164]  operate safely and smartly, but have a system that people can earn money, become successful. What's the cause of reform regulation? How does it start? Joe, that's a good question. I think that there's a group of people that feel like government is the only way that society can be safe and regulated, that people left on their own will go crazy and do terrible things and running around the streets. 
[P165]  the way it works, right? Capitalism is a really good system. We've proven that. And overregulation starts squeezing capitalism to the point that it pushes out people from investing and creating jobs and creating opportunity. And L.A. has gotten to the point it's certainly over the bridge and needs to get pulled back. I mean, I can't even tell you how overregulated it is. And then on top of it, in L.A. now, we have too few cops. 
[P166]  And so the obligation to protect your property is getting pushed to private landowners. So like on our shopping centers, we have a very safe environment, friendly environment, family environment, all those kind of things we're very protective of. LAPD wants to do the right thing. They don't have the resources. So we've had to supplement it, millions and millions of dollars of private security. And that's a whole other problem because what about the individual landowner in a neighborhood? 
[P167]  that doesn't have the kind of protection they need and they don't have the police force to protect them and running a business becomes impossible. So, and again, those things are just fixable. They really are fixable. So regulations, water, law and order, what other things are giant issues about L.A. that you think need to be addressed?

[P117]  school in the middle of the heart of the worst part of Los Angeles with the homelessness in Skid Row. And it's called Paralos Ninos. And my wife and I have been supporting that school for over 30 years now. Outside the doors is the biggest sea of inhumanity of homeless people just strewned out on the street, drugged out, all the terrible mental health conditions. 
[P118]  door and it's beautiful and caring and loving. And this school that we support, there's a series of schools, takes in children from six months to five years old. The parents are all working parents, below the poverty line working parents. So they're working in the sweatshops, whatever the case may be. They're living down on Skid Row in apartments, two or three families in an apartment, working their tail off to just survive. 
[P119]  to be able to get their child in this school that costs them nothing. It's fully supported. Those are the dearest, sweetest children in the world. We love going down there. Our kids have worked down there since they were little kids. We do a Christmas party for them. And what gives us such joy is seeing the hope in their eyes. And I know it sounds corny, but it's such an important path that we've got to get our elected officials to be more supportive of that and get more of these kind of schools and give more of these families 
[P120]  to do well because they want to do well. But the system is frankly against them. And that's what I wanted to change more than anything. Well, let's talk about that. This school, there's no reason why they should have to encounter that environment outside that school. You're right. There's no reason. This is not nuclear waste. This is not something that can't be cleaned up for 5 million years. We have to leave it alone. This is human beings. This is human devastation out there in the street. The fact that these kids 
[P121]  have to encounter that first of all what does that do for your sense of hope and your your future of the world like this is what you're seeing every day like you you absorb that from your environment the the sadness and the devastation all around you and you're seeing people with lost lives out in the street right in front of your school when you're a young kid and you're a developing mind and that's the environment that you encounter all the time like that is gonna fuck your head up forever yeah it's very tough and then there's the question of the sweatshops like 
[P122]  Why? Why? How come people that work their tail off constantly have to live three, four families in an apartment? Like what the hell is going on there? I agree. Yeah. But that's what that's what I'm saying. That's what I think we got to start fixing. Yes. Right. And if you start fixing that now, your point is right. These kids having to see that every day, they're being yelled at, you know, by people as they're walking through the doors and all that. It's terrible. 
[P123]  God that school is there because if that school wasn't there, they have nothing. They got nothing. Right. They're on the street. No, it's amazing. I mean, the problem outside the school, that should be fixed. That should be a public health issue. I mean, if you're worried, the future human beings, if you want to look at this country and you want to make America a great place, what you want is less people that are going to lose at life. You want less losers. The best chance you can have less 
[P124]  losers is start them off on a good path when they're young. That's right. Well said. And if you're starting them off on a good path when they're young, if you're giving them the tools that they need to have a successful life, giving them hope, giving them examples of good people that you could strive to be like, what would Mike do? I'll probably want to do what he does. He would get up and get this done. And I admire that person. And having people around you that are examples of someone who lives a life that you admire.

[P131]  There's one way that's good and there's one way that's evil. And there's the right wing people that want to be fascist, totalitarian dictators and they just want the wealthy to get wealthier and they want the poor to starve. And then you have the left wing side that has this idea of compassionate care and letting everybody be themselves and let people camp out and let, you know, and we need to treat people like human beings and they're not homeless. They're the unhoused and you start reframing things. 
[P132]  Just a bunch of nonsense. And unfortunately, these people are all conditioned to think that everybody opposed to them hates civil rights, hates women's rights, hates gay rights. They're right wing, hardcore, fascist assholes. What we need is someone. This is one of the things that made me happy about you, is that you need someone who appeals to people's sense of kindness and caring and, you know, being a progressive person. 
[P133]  terms of like social issues. Right. But yet understands human nature and understands business like that. You have to do things if you want to change things. You can't just throw money at it. You can't just have a bunch of people that are just bullshitting and not getting anything done. And this is the problem with L.A. that we see. Well, there's there's no doubt. But but don't you think that is changing now? Right. We've talked about that. I think it's changing. I think it's changing. 
[P134]  way. I mean, if you just give them a couple of good years, they'll be convinced that, you know... We got to fight that good fight, though, Joe. We got to fight that good fight. There's too much at risk. There is too much at risk. I do think... It all really depends on how successful Trump is in this four years that he has and the structure that he sets up and how he can kind of... If it really shows people that, hey, guess what? Gay people aren't losing rights. Hey, guess what? Women aren't losing rights. Hey, guess what? Civil rights 
[P135]  aren't being eroded. This is not what's happening. And then the whole country benefits. If we see GDP go up, if we see homelessness go down, that would be amazing. If that happens, then maybe people could wake their mind up to the fact that you're not in this binary system and that you really shouldn't be a part of a team. You should be a part of Team America. And Team America is like we want the whole thing to be better. Everybody. All of us. Wouldn't that be great? It'd be amazing. It can be done. And it can be done. 
[P136]  It could be. Most people, I think, are reasonable, kind people. Most people. Yes. But I think people get trapped in ideologies. And California is one of the better examples of a place that's just trapped. You're either a Democrat or you're a fucking asshole. That's how you look at it. You know? Oh, God.

输入内容：
[P17]  2020 and 2024, how many different counties went red that were blue historically. So let's break down the problems with L.A. and what could be done to fix it. What do you see as like the primary issues of L.A. right now? Well, you know, you've got a homeless problem that continues to grow. So let's talk about that. Okay, 70,000 people in L.A. County. One of the things we've covered on that is it's at least 70,000. I mean, if they have a real accurate count. 
[P18]  But the real question is, why? And why is so much money spent on it and no results? We've covered it on this podcast that there's people that are bureaucrats that work for this department of homelessness, and they're making a quarter million dollars a year. And they have no incentive whatsoever to make anything better because it doesn't hurt them. They're not paid based on whether or not they clean up the homeless issue. They're just paid. So the longer the homeless issue goes on, the more they keep their job. 
[P19]  And it's a profitable job. And they just rant on and on about we need housing. Like, that's not the problem. But, you know, I had a plan and I'm confident my plan would have worked. Let's talk about housing for a minute. L.A. and L.A. County, they put in a tax called HHH to build 10,000 units. At least about a year ago, I think they had maybe short of 1,000 units built. 
[P20]  That's amazing. Over 10 years. Over 10 years. I'm amazed they built one. Yeah, I know. But you know what they built them for? $800,000 a unit. Wow. That was the cost of it. If you go to the sector, the nonprofit sector that's actually doing amazing work with the homeless, like down on Skid Row, Ground Zero, they're building on average $300,000 a unit. 
[P21]  waste on top of waste. It's ridiculous. So yeah, you're right. Very little is happening. Almost no housing is being built by the government, even though they have massive taxes. We got another tax called ULA. When you sell your home, you have to pay another 5% over $5 million. So there's taxes on top of taxes. There is a solution to the homeless. So let's give, I'll just give you an example. There's a company called Boxable outside of Vegas, and they're building units that are five, six hundred, 
[P22]  square feet. On average, they're about 60,000, 70,000 a unit. This young guy figured out how to build up basically a production line to knock these things out. And when I was campaigning, I said to him, when I win, I'm going to give you a contract for 30,000 units. And there's so much open space, Joe, in and around Los Angeles that's controlled by the city. And we're going to start getting people in homes, getting them taken care of, giving them the service they need.

[P172]  If they wanted to come back to California, you've got these enormous taxes. Right. So something has to be done on a state level, not just on a city level. That's right. To address that. That's right. So how do you address that? You should have competitive tax rates. I don't know why California needs to tax people much higher than any other state. Why would you? The cost of operating a state, you know, you've got very sophisticated states, very dense states. It's a matter of setting priorities. 
[P173]  to look at the tax code and make it fairer. We've got the highest gas costs in the country. Why does a gallon of gas in California cost more than a gallon of gas in California? Well, isn't that because in California you're required to sell gas that's refined in California? I don't know if that's the case. See if that's the case, Jamie. But I think the gas in California is also highly taxed. Of course. Why wouldn't they be? This is the question, though, Rick. It's like, where's all this money going? I don't know. It's an insanely high tax rate, 
[P174]  yet you don't have any money to fix the power lines. You've got this insanely high tax rate, but you can't clean up the homeless problem, even though you're throwing a lot of money on it. Where's that money going? I don't know. It's not going to the school system. They need to get these super nerds that are on top of this Department of Government efficiency and set them loose. Set them loose on California. We've got a lot of smart people in California, along with them, that really want to help the system. And I think the minute you bring some really smart people... 
[P175]  Foundation. You look at the list of people that are donating their time and talent. They're just brilliant people. I made one phone call to each of them. Would you give me your time and talent? I don't want a dollar from you. Yes, I'm in. Whatever it is, I'm in. And that's what we need to do more of is have the elected officials have the courage and the competency to reach out and get the smartest people in different industries to come 
[P176]  and help get their ideas and then implement them. That's the greatest form of government. Whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, it doesn't really matter if you've got great ideas. And if you're a big thinker, that's what I would do. That's what I am doing. But on a state level, like the taxes for the state, that would have to be addressed by the governor, right? The governor and the legislature, yeah. Yeah. What could be done about that? I think you've got to rebuild it. 
[P177]  Joe, I don't want to give you a specific proposal here, but it doesn't need to be as high as it is in order to operate the state of California if the state of California has their priorities right of what they're spending money on. And by the way, the best way, and we learned this from Reagan, to raise revenue for the government is to allow businesses and families to grow and create jobs and industries, not to suppress them. Right. 
[P178]  is giving people the incentive to leave, which we've seen, right? The exodus. If you start giving people a rate that allows them to be benefited by staying in the state of California, that business will grow and California is going to make more revenue. It's not rocket science. The economy grows. People have more money. It's better for everybody. And you get some jobs. You get people off the streets. This whole thing starts changing the dynamic. How great would that be? It would be pretty incredible. I just don't want to get my hopes up. Let's do it. 
[P179]  Come on. Don't leave me. Come on. Don't leave me. I think it's possible. It's just a daunting task. It is a daunting task. But, okay, I'm not throwing flowers at you. Look at what you've accomplished in your career. That was a daunting task. Yeah, but I didn't think about it. It just sort of lucked out. It wasn't luck. It was a little bit of luck. Everybody's got a little bit of luck. For sure. It was a hell of a lot of hard work, and you were very focused, and you had your head down, and you just kept going forward. So it can be done.

主题：旧金山与奥斯汀城市发展对比

输入内容：
[P87]  That place was amazing at one point in time. I used to love going to San Francisco. I haven't gone in years. It's just too crazy. No, it's terrible. It's a dump. It's unbelievable. It was one of the all-time great cities. One of the greatest cities in the country has just completely fallen. But no course correction until now. I'm hopeful for this new mayor as well. And I'm also hopeful that a lot of the new young tech people are fed up. I think the new people who grew up with the internet understand the corruption and the bullshit. 
[P88]  old people from a couple decades ago were really just spoon-fed bullshit from the mainstream media. And they thought that this was the only way to be. We're the kind, intelligent, well-read, progressive people on the West Coast. It's our responsibility to be compassionate and to be the most charitable people possible. And they just didn't realize you're not doing anybody a service by letting them camp out in front of your house and smoke meth. None of that's good. It's all real bad for them. It's all real bad for your kids. 
[P89]  All those businesses moved out. Yes. All those businesses moved out. San Francisco just became insane watching all these enormous chains just pull out. And then people get angry and cry racism when they pull out. Like, what are you doing? It's just from the outside. It's like moving to Texas was such an eye opener, too. I'm jealous. Being here in Austin today, all the new buildings going up. Yes. I said to my wife, oh, my God, look at this. It's booming. 
[P90]  Freedom. 
[P91]  How did they do it? They did a fantastic job. They bought a bunch of hotels. They put people up. They started programs. They put a lot of effort into it. But they were only dealing with a few thousand homeless people. They had like 3,000. And this is what Stephen Adler was saying. He was saying, you could fix that. You can't fix it when it gets to 80,000, 90,000. He's like, it just gets too big with the bureaucratic process. 
[P92]  outsider coming in and making radical change. The way it functions today, he's like, it's just too big. He goes, I think I can fix Austin. And I think I can fix Austin before I get out. And I think he did a great job. I mean, there's still problems. You're always going to have problems. You have cities. You're going to have mentally ill people. You're going to have drug addicts. You're going to have people that have just been abused their whole life and they're just destroyed mentally. And then they're out. And then you have schizophrenia and all these other. It's very sad. It's very sad. You know, we clearly need better mental health. 
[P93]  institutions set up in this country to deal with a lot of these people because that's what a lot of it. And a lot of it happened during the Reagan administration when they changed the- They closed them down. Yes. They closed down mental health institutes and just said, you're on your own and just let these people loose on the street. And then on top of that, you have the crack epidemic that comes around at the same time. It's like chaos, just full chaos. And you saw, like I saw the changes in the cities. I saw the changes in the news. 
[P94]  I saw, you know, and people were recognizing that this is like a new problem. But it's never been like Los Angeles where you're driving on the street. You just see blocks and blocks of tents. It's just like how is this not fixed? You're not even allowed to litter. So if you're not allowed to litter, how are you allowed to do that? There's definitely a couple of standards that are different. I'm not giving up that it can be fixed, though. 
[P95]  versus 80,000, whatever the number is. But it can be fixed because it has to be fixed. I think it has to be fixed by an outsider is what Stephen Adler's point was ultimately really. Yeah. It's like, you know, being in the system. I agree with that. There's no doubt it has to. And again, somebody that's willing to risk their political career by doing the right thing for the people on the street. These are human beings that have a right to be given a chance to have a better life. And a lot of people are there. 
[P96]  you know, just because everything went wrong in their life. And God bless them. And you got to try to fix it. And the waste of the money in doing it is a crime. Anyway, we've talked about it, but I'm still hopeful. I know I run overly optimistic in life, but I think it can be done. Well, it's worked out well for you. Well, I've been pretty fortunate and blessed in my life. Working hard and being overly optimistic actually works out sometimes, a lot of times.

[P14]  But I loved every minute of it. And, you know, I hope at some point that system is changing. And I think people are getting more frustrated lately. And they're looking for people who are competent rather than just people who may share ideology. All right. It's February. And by now, 80 percent of people have probably abandoned their New Year's resolutions. And it makes sense. Life can get crazy and all of a sudden you don't have the time. 
[P15]  with is AG1. It's an easy, realistic habit that you can make to benefit your whole body health. AG1 makes hard to get micronutrients easy to get and replaces multiple vitamins and supplements with just one scoop. You just mix it in some cold water, take a nice moment in the morning to do your body right. And honestly, it tastes pretty good. It's not easy to pack this many high quality ingredients with this much nutrient density, but AG1 makes it happen without added sugars or artificial sweeteners 
[P16]  AG1 is a great way to invest in your health now and in the long run, which is why I've partnered with them for so long. Try AG1 and get a free bottle of vitamin D3, K2, and five free AG1 travel packs with your first subscription at drinkag1.com slash Joe Rogan.

[P213]  Well, I'm optimistic, too. I am. We're going to get you back there. Good luck. I'm never leaving Texas. Okay. Fair enough. I'll never live in a big city again. I think you get too big. It's just people become a burden. I think there's a psychic aspect to it. Yeah. Just the mindset of living in a smaller place that's more relaxed. Yeah. It just feels better. I get it. Yeah. I get that, especially raising a family. Yes. 
[P214]  I did love living in L.A. I lived there for 25 years. I loved it. Yeah. I thought it was awesome. Had a great time there. You know, I still miss parts of it. I still miss the comedy store and I still miss, you know, there's there's amazing aspects to L.A. still. And there's an amazing group of human beings that live in L.A. still. It's an incredible city. Yeah. But the problem is. Everyone knew that it was amazing and everyone knew that everybody wanted to go there. And so they just sort of took everybody for granted. 
[P215]  And they said, look, let's just text the shit out of these people. They're staying. They're not going anywhere. It's California. Where are you going to go? That's right. There's still that attitude, by the way. Yes. Still that attitude. Yeah, that's what I felt. It doesn't work. That's what I felt. And that's what you hear from the governor and you hear from people when they brag about California. Instead of addressing why are people leaving, they talk about how great California is. Oh, we're kicking ass. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Still, but not as much as before. And there's a reason. You're on a downward trend. 
[P216]  It's the government. And not as much as we could. Yeah, not as much as we could. Well, listen, Rick, whatever you do, I wish you the best. Thank you, sir. I do hope you run for mayor again, and I hope you win this time, and I hope you can enact some of these ideas that you have, because I think they're very, very promising. And I think government needs people like you, people from the outside. I really do. So thank you very much. Thank you very much. This is a brilliant honor. My pleasure. My honor. Thank you.

[P73]  It doesn't matter. Are you competent? Do you have experience? Are you going to make decisions for the right reason? When I was the president of the police commission, it was the most amazing experience because Jim Hahn's mayor, we have a police department that was failing miserably after the Rodney King riots. The police department was under a federal consent decree. A federal judge was overseeing it. 
[P74]  We had Bernie Parks, who was the chief of police. I don't know if you remember Bernie Parks. He was probably there when you were living there. He came out of central casting. Very handsome, proud black man and wore the uniform beautifully, rose through the ranks. Super nice guy. We were friends. Jim Hunt calls me and says, hey, I want to appoint you as a president of the police commission. And I said, Mr. Mayor, I really appreciate it, but I don't want the job because I knew what the job was going to entail. 
[P75]  potentially having to fire a very, very popular chief of police. And he's two or three times called back. I finally did it. So glad I did because I learned so much from the experience. At the end of the day, decided we needed to move on and have a different chief of police. What was wrong? What was he doing? What he was doing, Joe, is he had put in procedures, discipline procedures that were so onerous on, 
[P76]  the officers, that one, officers were leaving. But more importantly, the bad guys, particularly the gangs, were very smart that they would start filing complaints in certain areas that they wanted to control around the city. And so the officers started getting all these complaints on their record. And once they did, it held up any kind of promotion or transfer. So what did the cops 
[P77]  not going to go to that area. And the minute they abandoned that area, the gangs controlled it and crime was going crazy. How clever. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So I would go to the chief and say, come on, you got to change the discipline process. Nope. Not changing a thing. Very stubborn guy. He had all the answers, but yeah. And I don't mean that. It's facetious. He didn't have all the answers, obviously. But so that was a main problem. So if you had an area of the city that bordered 
[P78]  L.A. County. L.A. City crime was rising. L.A. County was going down because the sheriffs were actually proactively and not in an abusive way, proactively policing. LAPD was retreating. Cops were upset. Cops were leaving. The academy is empty. All of these things were happening. I had to change leadership. I had people burning me in effigy, literally. My wife would call me and say, oh, my God, they're burning you outside of City Hall. They're marching. 
[P79]  It was crazy to put pressure on me to keep Bernie Parks, not because Bernie Parks was the best chief of police, because it was politically correct to do that. And I remember calling Jimmy Hahn, the mayor, and I said, I'm going to make a recommendation and you're probably not going to like it because you're going to come under a lot of heat. And to his credit, he said, just do what's right. I'll take the heat. And I recommended we hire Bill Bratton. 
[P80]  guy in to LA, his Boston accent and all, best cop in the country, built a team around him. We got crime down to levels not seen since 1950, doing all the right things, engaging the community, senior lead officers, walking the beat, getting to know the neighborhoods, started hiring. People wanted to be a member of LAPD. There was now back a pride in it. 
[P81]  completely turned it around within a couple of years. But that all came, and then Jimmy lost re-election because the black community unfortunately abandoned him because of not keeping Bernie Parks. It's one of the reasons. But he did the right thing. He didn't care about his political future. He cared about the city. He never gets enough credit for this. And I just learned that lesson, which I talked about earlier. 
[P82]  got the freedom to make a decision without worrying about getting reelected. It's probably where the president's head is. I'm just going to do what I think is right. It really is amazing what can happen. So let's get more people like that who just understand. Let's do what's right for people. I'm in public service. Serve the damn people. It almost seems like at this pretty simple you need someone who's outside of politics to to run for office. 
[P83]  I think you do. I know that sounds self-serving, but I think you do. Of course, it would sound self-serving coming from someone who wants you outside of it and wanted to be the mayor. But I think that's the correct response because the people that are in it are just too tied in. They're too tied in. They're too beholding. They're too beholding. It's entwined. The octopus has many tentacles. It's wrapped around everything. And it just stalls all progress and change. And no real radical change. 
[P84]  Change can ever be met. No one wants to go with it because it's going to disrupt all their different ideas and businesses. And people are going to look like they're responsible or incompetent. So they don't want change. They want to pretend that this is the only way to go forward. And then if someone does come along and changes things radically, I mean, it makes them all look terrible. And it's dangerous. It's dangerous for business. They're not in the business of helping people. They're in the business of keeping their job. 100%. Yeah. And that's what's gross.

主题：城市治理引入外部力量的必要性

输入内容：
[P85]  gross. And it's gross. And it seems like the only way that that ever gets resolved is you have to bring in someone who's a businessman or a businesswoman, someone who understands business, who's outside of this political system and says, I've studied this for years. There's a lot of things that could be fixed and they're not being done and we could do it. Yeah. And you know, the issue with that is it's such a tough system. There's so much that gets thrown at you. Yeah. Like the whole entire party of 
[P86]  Democrats came to go after you. I know. And I was a Democrat. I'm very moderate. Yeah. You know, I'm fiscally very conservative. I'm socially liberal. But they were – so, you know, what gives the incentive to the person on the outside to do it? Right. Nothing. And that's what we've got to figure out. Listen, I've got high hopes for San Francisco with their new mayor. Again, an outsider came in and won. I think that's great. I hope he does great. I hope he does too. 
[P87]  That place was amazing at one point in time. I used to love going to San Francisco. I haven't gone in years. It's just too crazy. No, it's terrible. It's a dump. It's unbelievable. It was one of the all-time great cities. One of the greatest cities in the country has just completely fallen. But no course correction until now. I'm hopeful for this new mayor as well. And I'm also hopeful that a lot of the new young tech people are fed up. I think the new people who grew up with the internet understand the corruption and the bullshit. 
[P88]  old people from a couple decades ago were really just spoon-fed bullshit from the mainstream media. And they thought that this was the only way to be. We're the kind, intelligent, well-read, progressive people on the West Coast. It's our responsibility to be compassionate and to be the most charitable people possible. And they just didn't realize you're not doing anybody a service by letting them camp out in front of your house and smoke meth. None of that's good. It's all real bad for them. It's all real bad for your kids. 
[P89]  All those businesses moved out. Yes. All those businesses moved out. San Francisco just became insane watching all these enormous chains just pull out. And then people get angry and cry racism when they pull out. Like, what are you doing? It's just from the outside. It's like moving to Texas was such an eye opener, too. I'm jealous. Being here in Austin today, all the new buildings going up. Yes. I said to my wife, oh, my God, look at this. It's booming. 
[P90]  Freedom. 
[P91]  How did they do it? They did a fantastic job. They bought a bunch of hotels. They put people up. They started programs. They put a lot of effort into it. But they were only dealing with a few thousand homeless people. They had like 3,000. And this is what Stephen Adler was saying. He was saying, you could fix that. You can't fix it when it gets to 80,000, 90,000. He's like, it just gets too big with the bureaucratic process. 
[P92]  outsider coming in and making radical change. The way it functions today, he's like, it's just too big. He goes, I think I can fix Austin. And I think I can fix Austin before I get out. And I think he did a great job. I mean, there's still problems. You're always going to have problems. You have cities. You're going to have mentally ill people. You're going to have drug addicts. You're going to have people that have just been abused their whole life and they're just destroyed mentally. And then they're out. And then you have schizophrenia and all these other. It's very sad. It's very sad. You know, we clearly need better mental health. 
[P93]  institutions set up in this country to deal with a lot of these people because that's what a lot of it. And a lot of it happened during the Reagan administration when they changed the- They closed them down. Yes. They closed down mental health institutes and just said, you're on your own and just let these people loose on the street. And then on top of that, you have the crack epidemic that comes around at the same time. It's like chaos, just full chaos. And you saw, like I saw the changes in the cities. I saw the changes in the news. 
[P94]  I saw, you know, and people were recognizing that this is like a new problem. But it's never been like Los Angeles where you're driving on the street. You just see blocks and blocks of tents. It's just like how is this not fixed? You're not even allowed to litter. So if you're not allowed to litter, how are you allowed to do that? There's definitely a couple of standards that are different. I'm not giving up that it can be fixed, though. 
[P95]  versus 80,000, whatever the number is. But it can be fixed because it has to be fixed. I think it has to be fixed by an outsider is what Stephen Adler's point was ultimately really. Yeah. It's like, you know, being in the system. I agree with that. There's no doubt it has to. And again, somebody that's willing to risk their political career by doing the right thing for the people on the street. These are human beings that have a right to be given a chance to have a better life. And a lot of people are there. 
[P96]  you know, just because everything went wrong in their life. And God bless them. And you got to try to fix it. And the waste of the money in doing it is a crime. Anyway, we've talked about it, but I'm still hopeful. I know I run overly optimistic in life, but I think it can be done. Well, it's worked out well for you. Well, I've been pretty fortunate and blessed in my life. Working hard and being overly optimistic actually works out sometimes, a lot of times.

主题：洛杉矶治安与法律秩序问题

输入内容：
[P97]  about law and order. That's a giant issue in Los Angeles. People do not feel as safe as they used to feel. They feel like there's more violent crime. It's more unreported crime. And maybe more concerning is that people get arrested and then immediately get released. Right. And there doesn't seem to be any repercussions for that. Right. So what would you do to change that? Well, thank goodness state law got changed. I mean, that's another really good example of what happened in California, that they repealed the law 
[P98]  Right. 
[P99]  chance to rebuild their lives. No doubt. It goes hand in hand. But we made a big change by getting rid of George Gascon as our district attorney, who was not prosecuting and allowing people. It was just a turnstile. You got arrested. You were let out. Can we get to the heart of that? Sure. What's the motivation for that? Motivation for doing that? Yes. Well, I probably won't explain it right because I don't agree with it. 
[P100]  is that from a social justice standpoint, quote unquote, you don't want to overpopulate the prisons. You don't want to hold people and take away their life for a minor crime. But a lot of it wasn't minor crimes. A lot of it wasn't minor crimes. There was one of them that was a guy who was this crazy homeless guy who pulled a knife on a sheriff. And then two weeks later, at least somewhere a little short time after that, I don't know if it's two weeks, attacked a man with his family with a machete on the beach. 
[P101]  Yeah. No, I know. You're right. You're right. I mean— So that's a violent criminal? Yeah, you're right. You're absolutely right. And I can't explain it because it's just—it's so messed up. I don't even know how you justify letting somebody out of jail or not holding them with bail, any of that. I don't understand it. I think most people got to the point they were so worried about where crime was going, they did finally get rid of George. And we brought in Nathan Hockman, and I think Nathan's doing a great job. 
[P102]  So I can't explain it. But the fear is that it's done on purpose. This is the fear. Oh, of course it is. 
[P103]  People live in a constant state of fear. And what's the end goal of that? It has to be profit. I mean, someone has to be profiting off of it. Who profits off of that? I don't know. Ask George Soros. Yeah, right. Ask the people that fund these extremely liberal district attorneys that all seem to have the same idea. But do you think that tide is turning? No cash bail. I do. I do think that tide is turning. And I know that Elon Musk wants to do sort of the exact opposite. He's been talking about that. Financing people that are much more reasonable. 
[P104]  believe in law and order. Well, Nathan is a good example of that. I mean, that's great. We need fair laws. We need, we need kind justice. We need, we do need rehabilitation, but we also need to protect people that aren't criminals. Of course. That's the primary thing is protect the general public, serve and protect, right? That's the whole idea. We need to protect everybody else. And then the people that were life did them wrong and they've wound up like, let's figure out a way to actually rehabilitate them instead of just putting them in cages. Yeah. And people are doing that. I mean, there's some very successful programs. 
[P105]  that are doing that. But I agree with you. I mean, we got to get back to the point where government's primary function is to protect the public and give them the ability to prosper, give them the ability to build a business, raise your family, keep your community safe. It's just so basic. It's so basic. It's gone upside down. Yeah. That's what's crazy is that law and order thrown out the window. Without law and order, no one is safe. You don't understand that if you just don't go after bad people, then they have no 
[P106]  fear of doing whatever they want. And then you're letting them out on jail. So out of jail. So then you've got more of them out than ever before. There was a podcast that I listened to where there was a former gang member who was talking about how they're going to let 70,000 hard criminals out of the L.A. jails. And he's like, I'm getting out of town. This guy was a hardcore gang member. He's like, L.A. is going to get too crazy in the next year. It's just nuts. And, you know, there was the whole defund the police movement, which was just catastrophic. 
[P107]  That whole – and seeing politicians, including Kamala Harris, seeing politicians openly say and post it on Twitter, we need to defund the police, which is just crazy. It is as wrong as it can be. Yeah. Certainly hold bad cops accountable. Certainly have better training. Yeah. Certainly have higher standards. Yeah. But defunding the police, like what are you talking about? You need to do the opposite. That's right. You need to train them better. Refund them. Right. 100%. 
[P108]  Definitely make people feel safe that they're interacting with police officers. But respect these people. Respect these people that are protecting your life. That's right. Because all those people, when something goes down, they call 911. They're furious when cops don't show up. That's right. All these people who talk shit about the cops that are protected. Defund the police. You're protected by armed security people. Right. And you're saying defund the police. This is fucking nonsense. It's nonsense. Couldn't agree more. And for people that suffered because of this defund the police, 
[P109]  thing and this whole wave of crime that went through LA in the wake of it all, those people are the people that you can get to. The people that saw it, experienced it, know the consequences of this foolish direction that everything is going in, those are the people that you can still reach. And I think it could be reached with a person like you that is a compassionate, kind, liberal guy when it comes to social issues, but understands business and understands 
[P110]  like accountability and that you have to see positive results. You have to do what needs to be done to get those positive results. You can't just do the same shit over and over again and pay more people. And we need a bigger budget. You know, like, oh, let's raise the budget. We've increased the budget to fix the problem. You're not fixing it. It keeps getting bigger. It's just nuts. It needs someone outside the system. And that's why I was really happy to talk to you. And that's why I'm really happy that you're still involved. Because a lot of people like yourself that are 
[P111]  very wealthy and you don't have to do this. This is not going to be you're going to make money doing this. Like this is probably going to be a huge strain, a tremendous amount of pressure. But some people feel a calling and they feel like I think I can do something and fix this that other people maybe won't be able to do. I appreciate that. And I do. I do. Because what's the alternative? We stay in the same path. It gets worse. The alternative is it gets worse. It's going to get worse. And more and more people are leaving. More and more businesses

[P200]  empty the entire ocean? It's crazy. There's so much water right there. It's crazy. First of all, we're dumping sewage. You know, there's tertiary treatment where water is potable. We dump sewage, secondary treatment. It doesn't hurt the ocean, but we're dumping it. Take it to tertiary treatment. Put it back in the natural underground aquifers and save it. Yeah. Right? That could be done. The abundance of water that goes into the ocean. 
[P201]  It's sort of what you start out with. Desal, brilliant. Absolutely. We should be doing it. We should have desal plants supporting Los Angeles and big parts of Southern California. Also, it creates jobs. It creates jobs. You can do it where it's environmentally safe. Absolutely. And it has a redundancy of power that comes off of it also that's helpful because we've got a power shortage in California. Absolutely. 
[P202]  know how to supply right now. And again, back in the day... How does it work as a redundancy of power? Well, because you've got to generate a lot of power for the decel. When the decel is not operating, you've still got an operating power plant there. So you can skew up the operation in order to have additional energy coming off your decel plant. Okay. And... You've got to build a power plant to decel because of the amount of power it consumes to clean the water. And how much water, 
[P203]  could be desalinated. Like, how much of an impact can that actually have? Does it depend upon the size of the plant and how many of them there are? It depends on the size of the plant. You can, yeah, depends on the size of the plant. So, ideally, they should be set up, though, like at various intervals along the coast, and you'd probably fix the entire, I mean, California could be completely green. Well, listen, it could be, but it's also, you mix sources of water. Like, right now, in L.A., I'll just take L.A., you've got, 
[P204]  The aqueduct that's bringing water down that William Mulholland built at the turn of the century, right? He was brilliant on how he did it. There isn't one pump. It's all gravity flow that comes down from Inyo County, Owens Valley comes down. There was a whole bunch of controversy and everything, but all of that has sort of been fixed. That water comes down. There's some water that comes down from the state. There's water that Los Angeles has natural aquifers we pump, right? 
[P205]  And then you add decel to it. Then you have one more supply that's backing up supply. And then, of course, you want to capture rainwater, which we do a terrible job of. We let it go in the ocean. We don't capture as much rainwater in Los Angeles as we should. Probably not much at all. But even with the sewage, why wouldn't you just spend the investment and take the treatment and put it back in the aquifer and have clean water? Yeah. 
[P206]  supply. All we're doing now is we're dumping it in the ocean. Yeah, it's very stupid. And again, it's doing the same thing you've always done and hoping for a different result. Yeah. What was the pushback from the idea of desalination plants? Because there's a long line of thinkers that there should be no power plants along the coast of California because of the emissions. So years ago, when I was president of DWP, under Tom Bradley's leadership at the time, converted all the old 
[P207]  oil plants on the coast to gas, to be clean. There's better technology now. You know, you can convert those. They're testing out hydrogen and convert them to hydrogen plants. There's a big plant that DWP built in Utah when I was president called Intermounter Power Project. It was the cleanest coal-burning plant in the country at the time. This is probably, you know, 25 years ago now, 30 years ago. They're now testing and converting it to hydrogen, 
[P208]  which will be absolutely clean. That's smart, right? So we need- Literally makes oxygen. Right. Yeah. We need more- The question is, how do you boil water? Pick your source. That's what a plant does. A plant boils water, creates steam, spins a turbine, you got electricity. Right. So whatever kind of fuel you want, we built- We were partners in Palo Verde, which is the nuclear plant in Arizona. We need more nuclear plants in this country. Yeah, I was going to get to that. 
[P209]  this state, you know, hasn't been aggressive in building more clean burning plants because we need them. Nuclear has a negative stereotype in the public eye, unfortunately, because of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, because of Fukushima. People think nuclear, they think disaster. They think terrible waste. You can't get away from it. It pollutes the ground forever. But it can be made very safe. But it can be made much safer and much cleaner. 
[P210]  And it's not being done because we're – and then also people have to understand that if you go back to the cars that were on the road at the time these nuclear power plants were built, those cars were polluting like crazy. You got a brand new car. The emissions are far less. Or you get a Tesla. You have none. Right? So like why would we look at the same old architecture of these – like the Fukushima one is a prime example. It only had one backup generator. 
[P211]  went out, they were done. They have them now where they can actually shut them down. There's new designs. Oh, yeah. And listen, Palo Verde, again, is probably 20 or 30 years old. It's been an incredibly performing plant. Never has had a problem. So, again, this is where you sort of get into what your point is. Get somebody from the outside who's thinking big, who's thinking outside the box, who wants to change the landscape for the better way of having 
[P212]  a quality of life and is willing to think big. And you're going to get kicked in the head sometimes. And not every idea is going to make sense and work. But you only get there if you throw enough good ideas out on the table that you figure things out, right? And so when you take a look at Los Angeles, when you take a look at California, I'm hopeful that you get leadership that just starts looking at things differently and will make some small moves that turns into big changes. So we'll see. Again, I'm optimistic about it.

输入内容：
[P38]  180,000, though, a lot of them, it's just because they're trying to find a place, but they're not destitute. A lot of these people are people that had some money. Who knows what's going to happen with insurance, right? Right, but see, that's the problem. Unfortunately, the fire insurance issue in Los Angeles is kind of insane. It's terrible. Where, you know, we were talking in the lobby before I was evacuated three times when I lived in L.A. Two of my neighbors lost their homes, you know, and watching those folks cry. 
[P39]  in front of the rubble. Where they lived, it's just horrible. But they kept their lives, and this was 2018, and they rebuilt some of them. Two of the houses are still gone in my old neighborhood. They never rebuilt. Sorry to hear about that. They just pulled out. It's like, what am I going to do? They lose everything. Mel Gibson lost books from the 1600s. Mel is a very religious man. 
[P40]  He collects these ancient, irreplaceable books. And then, of course, the loss of lives is horrifying. That issue is an issue that has plagued L.A. and California forever. So a big point of contention during the election, and even during the first Trump administration, was the use of water. And that water was being funneled into the Pacific Ocean. And now, apparently, you could tell me more. You probably know more than I do. 
[P41]  What has been done about that water? Because it seems like Trump has changed that. Well, I think what Trump did a good job of, first of all, I'm grateful for the fact that he flew out, had a meeting, and I'm grateful. And, you know, I have my differences time to time on some issues with him, but he sat down and he was forceful in a very strong way of holding the elected officials accountable, like get the people back in their homes now. 
[P42]  The fact that in this tragedy we've got a president who's also a builder who understands what needs to be done I think is great. And I hope he continues to hold all the elected officials accountable. He can make a big difference. And we need it. On the water issue, listen, I headed up Department of Water and Power, like I said, for 10 years. I have a pretty good understanding of the water issues. What's happening in the north really has not as much of an impact. 
[P43]  happening down in Southern California in terms of how the water gets transferred around. It doesn't mean we should be pouring water into the ocean. We should not be. We should be doing a lot of things. We should be collecting water. We should be holding water. We should be recycling water. We should be doing a lot of things. What happened in Los Angeles, which is just close to negligence, if not negligence, Joe, the fire hydrants ran out. We evacuated our home. 
[P44]  And we're in Brentwood, so you know the area. We're 15 minutes from the Palisades where the fire started. And it was my birthday. We were having family dinner. From the second floor, we saw the flames. We said, we're going to have to get out of here. The power went off. We said, we're out. Gathered the family. We moved down to a home we have in Newport Beach. 
[P45]  who sort of embedded in with the fire command post. And my heart dropped. He said, we just lost your daughter's home. And I said, oh my God, Banyan, how the hell did that happen? He said, you can't believe it. The hoses ran dry and the whole neighborhood went up. And I was so angry that Fox 11, the local Fox station was on with Alex Michelson. 
[P46]  And I texted him because they were reporting live. This is about 1030 at night. I said, are you getting reports that they've run out of water? He said, not at all. And I said, you need to report this. He said, do you want to come on live? I said, yeah, hook me up. And I went on. He couldn't believe it. And some of the media was trying to spin it. I saw that. Like it's not true. Yeah. And then they went right to the fireman. Went right to the fireman, right? Yeah. The fireman said, yeah, we're standing there, empty hoses. 
[P47]  How in God's name, the second largest city in the country, can you have a water system that runs out of water in a fire? And you knew this was coming, right? They gave warnings of catastrophic winds. The reservoir is empty over, I think it was 1.7 million gallons. I think it's 11 million. Maybe 11 million. Yeah. Probably right. It's empty during fire season. Yeah. You've got brush. 
[P48]  It hasn't been cleared for 40 years. There was a whole bunch of us raising hell about that after the fire in Brentwood six years ago. Nothing was done. The fire department wasn't pre-deployed, so there weren't engines staffed in different areas. You've got a fire department that's underfunded, and you've got fire equipment that's mothballed. And then the mayor flies to Ghana. And the mayor's out of town. So what should have been done, and who's responsible? 
[P49]  Well, I think the leadership is responsible at every level. I think the mayor is responsible for not being better prepared. I think she's certainly responsible for not staying in town. That's a lack of judgment. If you want to be a leader, the first thing you have to do is be present. I don't know what all the meetings that she had beforehand to make sure everybody was prepared. But years ago, the brush should have been cleared. Yes. Right. And you probably couldn't have prevented the fire. Maybe you couldn't have prevented the fire. Only God knows. 
[P50]  But you could have mitigated it. We don't really know the source of the fire yet. And we do know there was quite a bit of arson. That's true. That's true. And there was a fire, to your point, there was a fire on New Year's Eve from fireworks. And there's some talk that it may have been in that same area that this sparked up again. Or maybe it was another arson that went up there. But it seemed like there were several fires that started very close to each other. It seems like highly unlikely. 
[P51]  That there was just three accidents that took place at the same time as these catastrophic winds. Could be. The most sinister version of it is that somebody wanted this to happen, maybe some mentally ill person. I know they did arrest... It's a sickness. It is a sick... Arsonists are... They're really sick people. And it's a known psychological illness. There's a guy that they arrested that was a known arsonist, several times arrested, who had a fake fire truck and drove down. I saw that. 
[P52]  Yeah. Drove down from Oregon to do who knows what. Can you imagine? Yeah. Well, there's. You got to be really, really sick. There's some psychos out there. Yeah. There's some real sick people out there. There's some weird people also that enjoy watching other people lose everything. It's very strange. Yeah. But I guess people who feel like they have nothing and they feel like the world has screwed them over and they haven't got the breaks they deserve. They literally want to watch. And there's this entitled culture that we live in that kind of tells people that the reason why other people are successful is because they've stolen from you. Right. 
[P53]  just the craziest thing to say in America. But it gives them an excuse. It gives them an excuse. And it also gives them a pathway to vent their anger and instead point it productively at their own lives. Like, why am I in this position right now? What could I have done differently? What personal responsibility do I have for the way I live right now? Instead of that, it's like, no, no, no. These rich people, they fucked you over. That's right. They took advantage of it. Yeah. So the water, why, what is the explanation for why that enormous reservoir, 
[P54]  that provides the Palisades with water was empty. Well, the explanation that's been said is it's out of service because the cover on it needed to be repaired. Oh, the cover. The cover. Because, you know, we're very sensitive in L.A. that bad things don't get in our water. So they have to keep all these reservoirs covered, which in general I get. I get the safety of that. But how about this? You know that you have catastrophic winds coming. 
[P55]  in the water. Yeah. When you need it in your fire hydrant. Yeah. Right? That could have been done in probably a couple of weeks. Whatever it took. Yeah. And it's not like we don't know. L.A. has fire season. I remember every year because where I used to live in Bell Canyon is, you know, it's about 35 minutes from L.A. Right. And it gets rough out there. It's like a lot of like big rolling hills and it gets all filled with grass. And if it catches and the winds start whipping through those canyons, the winds in California for people to 
[P56]  don't know, every year we get the Santa Ana winds. That's right. And they're crazy. They are crazy. Some of them were 100 miles an hour this year. That is just, if you've ever been out there for that, that's nuts. And if there's fires blowing, boy. No, it's a terrible combination. I mean, the early settlers called them the devil winds. They've been there forever. Forever. To your point, they've been there forever. So just think about, you know, had the brush been cleared, had the reservoirs been full, had the fire trucks been stationed, 
[P57]  And had there been a whole series of protocols in place, again. We could have saved some houses. We could have saved a lot of lives, a lot of houses, a lot of jobs, a lot of pain. A lot of pain. Yeah. Yeah. So that's just incompetence. There's no way you could say, oh, I see why they didn't do that. Oh, I see why they didn't have the resources. Oh, it's not their fault. No, there's none of that there. No one's saying that. That's right. Everyone is saying it's a failure. 
[P58]  needed. Even the spin masters, even the greatest of gaslighters have nothing. There's not one person who's tried to pass the buck. I've not seen one successful person go on the air and say everything was done that could have been done. We have amazing leadership. We're really proud of them. We're really lucky we have them. Not one. You're right. Not one. That's kind of crazy. It is kind of crazy. Because they gaslight everything, no matter what it is. Everything's safe and effective. Everybody's fine. 
[P59]  Everything's great. He's sharp as a tack. They gaslight the shit out of you with everything. But with this one, they're like, there's nothing you can say. I agree with that because the facts are the facts. The facts are the facts. You just can't argue around the facts. And also there's a thing that happens when an area bigger than Manhattan that's filled with the most liberal people. They're the most liberal. They're the most blue no matter who. The most compassionate, kind people.

[P180]  I couldn't do what you did. Yeah, you could. Oh, no. You're a stud. I couldn't. I can't. In fact, I just want to go on a tangent for a second. Sure. Okay. My boys got me addicted to taking an ice bath. Okay. You're insane. What's the temperature of yours? 34. Oh, my God. Okay. I saw a picture of you removing a sheet of ice. Yeah. Yeah. I'm nowhere near the stud that you are, obviously. 
[P181]  It's just three minutes, and it makes the rest of the day wait. I'm at 50. 50's cold. Yeah, and I'm addicted to it. Yeah, it's great. How long are you in for? Three minutes. You'll still get the benefits at 50. Okay. What I get at 30 is much more suck, and getting through the suck is part of it. How long is the suck part? It sucks for about a minute. Yeah, the first minute. The first minute really sucks. Yeah, that's with me at 50. I'm like heavy breathing. I got some stem cells shot into my shoulder recently, and when I do that, you have to take like 72 hours. 
[P182]  Because the inflammation is actually good from the initial injection to heal the area. And so I took three days off. And it's funny. Just taking three days off, when you get back in, the suck is worse. Yeah. But for me, it doesn't get any easier, though. It doesn't? After the first minute? No, no, no, no, no. Oh, every day. Every day. Yeah. It gets a little easier. It never gets easy. But it's like it's easier now. Like now I'm like four or five days in. 
[P183]  Pop the lid off of it. I don't even think about it. I just go, get in there. Just shut up. Put the timer on. Get in there. Just sit. Just sit there. I do love it. But the thing about it is the way you feel when you get out is so amazing. You feel alive. You feel energized. You feel like your brain is firing. It kicks up your dopamine levels by 200%. It lasts for hours and hours. You feel wonderful. And that's the thing. 
[P184]  gratitude. You need to delay this. People like to feel comfortable now. You need to delay that. Put that on the side. I like that. Just suck it up for a while. Yeah, I like that. And doing that, forcing yourself to have voluntary adversity, just like have three minutes a day that's horrible, is going to make the whole rest of your day better. It's only three minutes. How much time has he spent on Instagram? Just flipping through nonsense. Just looking at bullshit. Getting upset at Twitter. Going on Twitter. 
[P185]  what are these people talking about? Like three minutes. No, it's addicting to me. I'm a, I never thought I would be addicted to it. I love it. I love it. And the other thing I love, which I heard you do is the infrared. Yeah. I do that too. I do that today. Yeah. I do it every day. Yeah. Oh, you're talking infrared sauna. I do a red light bed every day. I do a regular sauna, dry sauna because, uh, I think there's more research that's been done, particularly out of Finland. You know, they did a 20 year study where they showed a 40, 
[P186]  decrease in all-cause mortality for people who use the sauna four days a week. Really? Yeah. More than an infrared? Just an old-fashioned dry sauna? It's just not more than an infrared. I think, look, infrared is definitely beneficial. I think the whole idea is heat shock proteins. The whole idea is raising your body temperature to the point where your body develops these heat shock proteins in order to mitigate the effects of the extreme heat. Because you can really only tolerate that extreme heat for a certain amount of time. A regular dry sauna gets 
[P187]  way hotter. So my sauna, I like to keep it at 196. So I get in there at 196 for 25 minutes. And it's not fun. It's not fun. It sucks. But that stress of doing that is what makes your body stronger. It's the response, your body's response to that extreme stress that makes it stronger. And this is what develops the heat shock proteins. And this is what is responsible for this. There's an EPO-like effect on 
[P188]  on your blood where you have more red blood cells. It raises your endurance. It's almost like static cardio. Even though you're sitting there, you know, I wear a heart rate monitor sometimes when I'm in there, and my heart's jacked up to 147 beats a minute at the end. I mean, it's pretty high. That's high, yeah. When you're hitting that 21-minute mark and you're looking at your watch going, oh, Jesus Christ, four more minutes of this shit. And then is your recovery quick once you get up, your heart rate's down? I'm so used to it. But another benefit is living in Texas. 
[P189]  When I go out in the heat and the sun, it doesn't bother me at all. My body's fully adapted to being hot. You know, it's just it's hot every day. And this just that's again, it's just voluntary adversity. It's forcing yourself to do something physically and it makes the rest of your day way easier. OK, so you should get into politics. Voluntary adversity. I would way rather have people like you on and try to help you out and get involved. I appreciate that. I'm grateful for that.

[P63]  I think the reality has set in, honestly, and it's unfortunate it's taken this, but the reality really has set in that you've got to have competent leadership. Yes. And what happened at DWP, because I was there for 13 years, 10 of which I was president, or close to 10, is the head of that department got politicized. 
[P64]  Years ago under Bradley and under Reardon, under Hahn, the general manager of the Department of Water and Power was always somebody who came through the ranks, who was just this exceptional engineer. And that department was regarded as best in class in the country as a utility, bar none. The best financial rating, the best engineers wanted to work there. It built some of the most amazing projects in history, including Hoover Dam. So let's just start with that one, right? 
[P65]  Then what happened? Politics creeped into who was the general manager. That destroys an organization. This is an organization that's not in the business of being necessarily doing what's politically important at the time. It's in the business of delivering water and power. And the failure is also there. 
[P66]  I don't know what she did and didn't do. But the kind of failure that's on her desk where the buck stops, she needs to resign. She needs to be fired, in my opinion, by the mayor and be held accountable for whoever made bad decisions, including herself. But we're allowing this. And so the minute you allow that, that continues this creep of incompetence is tolerated. 
[P67]  it shouldn't be tolerated because people lost their lives. They lost their homes. Right? Am I right about that? You're 100% right. And I think you're 100% right about politics. And the problem with politics is that people want to preserve the structure that pays them. They want to preserve the entity that they're invested in, that they have their time in, they have all their connections. And this is the weird world of politics versus the world of business. 
[P68]  And, you know, what's fascinating right now is we're getting a chance to see what happens when you take a business approach to the government in the White House. We're seeing right now with this whole USAID thing where they're uncovering massive amounts of corruption and waste and just a lot of weird shady shit with NGOs and where an enormous amount of money is going. 
[P69]  and instead of saying like well this is just how it is and this is how these politicians get funded so let's just keep this thing going the same way it is and make some incremental changes to try to make people happy so we still get elected right instead of that you're seeing a politician a president who's coming in who can't get reelected so he's just going ham and he's just cleaning out everything and people are freaking out the same people that say we need radical change 
[P70]  radical change. We don't need this. But you do. The government does. They need oversight. And they haven't had that. And because of that, you're seeing this not just waste. You could call it waste, but it's deeper. It's deeper than waste. It's corruption. And you're seeing that corruption get weeded out. I am hoping that this is successful and that it yields a benefit to the American people, to the working class people, to everybody, where they recognize like, hey, we can't just 
[P71]  be spending all our fucking tax money on nonsense. And it all should be done with a real clear understanding of getting results. If that happens and that idea spreads across the country because ideas spread and people change their minds. And sometimes it happens. One guy in the neighborhood will go, you know what? Fuck this. I'm fed up. And then everybody will be like, yeah, I've been kind of thinking that too. I just didn't want to say it. And then people start talking. And then it's not a scary thing to 
[P72]  discuss it. That's right. It opens the door. Right. A hundred percent. And I think you're seeing that now. I feel it in L.A. You're seeing that now. Like I said, it's terrible that it took this kind of tragedy to have people seeing it. I'm a big believer it can change. I'm a big believer that L.A. can turn around. I'm a big believer we can fix the problems. I'm a big believer we can fix the problems in California. I really am. And I think we have started to turn this corner where people are saying, you know what, whether you're Democrat or Republican, to me, sort of

输入内容：
[P4]  battleship around? Because it's a big battleship. It's a big battleship. And people will argue that the mayor of L.A. doesn't have a lot of authority like other mayors. You know, I learned a lot, Joe. I worked for three mayors. I worked for Tom Bradley when I was in my mid-20s as a commissioner. I was the head of Department of Water and Power. I worked for Dick Reardon. He brought me back into head of DWP during the energy crisis. The department was under a lot of financial strain. 
[P5]  Tim Hunt, who brought me in to turn around LAPD, and I was the police commissioner, the head of the police commission. So I've seen really good leadership. And honestly, what we've had in the last two mayors is not good leadership, and we're paying a price for it. So you may not have a lot of power, but actually, I think the most powerful thing you can have that I learned as a police commissioner, if you're not worried about getting reelected or reappointed, it's really amazing what can happen. 
[P6]  Make decisions that are actually in the best interest of the people. And I believe the career politicians are always worried about getting reelected. They are scared to death of getting a real job. They've never had to sign the front of a check, only the back. So it's very difficult for them to even think about being out of office. So they just circulate. You know, they go from the city council to the state assembly to the state senate. 
[P7]  That look and feel of leadership, which is pretty weak. I think Dick Rudin was a good example of a guy who came in and did a lot of great stuff. I actually think Jimmy Hahn did a lot of great stuff as mayor. So I would go in there with some strong leadership. I would certainly go in there and reach across the aisle and find common ground and all of those things you need to do to move forward. But I would certainly plant some really strong goals that everybody knew we were working towards. 

[P10]  both immigrants. My, my grandfather, paternal grandfather was a gardener in Los Angeles. He lived in Boyle Heights. He started as a, as a coal miner. He actually probably had one of the worst jobs you could ever have in life. When he immigrated here to a little town called Uniontown, Pennsylvania, he was the dynamiter. He was the guy that had to go in the lead. Oh boy. Yeah. Set the dynamite and get the hell out in time. And his brother who immigrated with him said, come to LA. It's sunny. My, my dad was actually 
[P11]  born in a coal mining camp outside the coal mine. But anyway, he was a gardener out here. And we actually grew up in his truck as he would go around. And they had this small little home they rented in Boyle Heights. And I think about what L.A. gave to my grandparents, to my dad, to me, my family, the opportunity to build a business. 

[P112]  close down. But here's what really hit me on the campaign. And I was telling our family, I've got four kids and they're 35 to 25 and just incredible people. And my wife is wonderful. I'm really incredibly blessed with all of that. I was so worried when I decided to run for mayor, the impact on the family, right? A little bit scary, high profile, all these kinds of things. It ended up being the greatest experience. And we would go into neighborhoods, hardworking neighborhoods, 
[P113]  of people that just wanted the ability to work hard and live their life, that would just want the ability to allow their daughter to be able to walk to school on her own and not have to walk around an encampment or for fear that there'd be somebody that would attack her on the way to school. Right. The most basic things. And we'd give them a hug. You know, they would cry. We would cry. And I would tell the kids that cry is hope. 
[P114]  we're seeing there is for the first time, there's actually somebody coming into their neighborhood, a neighborhood that historically doesn't vote in large chunks. So the politicians forget about them, right? Because they're not likely voters necessarily. But we were trying to mobilize it. And we were also trying to give a voice to people that don't have a voice. How inspiring that was for me. That's what fueled me. And you're right. I don't, 
[P115]  want a career as a politician. I want a career of being able to give back and help and take the group of people that have the least voice but are some of the hardest working people of our society and give them an opportunity to grow. That was my grandfather as an immigrant, as a gardener. But he had the opportunity to raise his family where he didn't have to worry about all this shit. 
[P116]  It's just changed so much. So I believe we've got to get our elected officials. If we take people who are the hardest working, the dearest people that have the most impact because of crime, because of homelessness, because of being overly taxed, all of these kind of things, and we give them hope and a path forward, everybody benefits from it. You start solving so many problems, Joe.

主题：洛杉矶商业环境与政策改革

输入内容：
[P161]  rebuilt. It's immensely complicated. And again, I mean, I'll be very honest. The government just cannot do it alone. There's just no way. There's just no way. One of the things that people complain a lot about California is regulations. Yeah. And how regulated it is and how difficult it is to start businesses and to maintain businesses. Hugely over-regulated. What can be done about that? Cut through the red tape. We have more regulations. It's insane to run a business. I run a business. 
[P162]  obviously in LA and in California. And it's to the point that you would never, I would never restart the business in LA and in California. It's too expensive. The tax rates are too high for everybody, not just people that are making money. I'm talking about people who are, you know, moderate, hardworking people. Tax rates too high. But the regulation on small businesses in Los Angeles, you have businesses now closing because of it's over-regulated. And then it got even, 
[P163]  frankly, worse post-COVID, because a lot of the restrictions they took away during COVID in order to allow businesses to survive and restaurants to operate, they started taking them away, like just having outdoor dining. Like, why would you do that? Why would you make it more difficult for a small business owner to operate a restaurant? So that gets back to, like, the business approach to running government. Let people prosper. Have a system. There's certain laws you need, obviously, 
[P164]  operate safely and smartly, but have a system that people can earn money, become successful. What's the cause of reform regulation? How does it start? Joe, that's a good question. I think that there's a group of people that feel like government is the only way that society can be safe and regulated, that people left on their own will go crazy and do terrible things and running around the streets. 
[P165]  the way it works, right? Capitalism is a really good system. We've proven that. And overregulation starts squeezing capitalism to the point that it pushes out people from investing and creating jobs and creating opportunity. And L.A. has gotten to the point it's certainly over the bridge and needs to get pulled back. I mean, I can't even tell you how overregulated it is. And then on top of it, in L.A. now, we have too few cops. 
[P166]  And so the obligation to protect your property is getting pushed to private landowners. So like on our shopping centers, we have a very safe environment, friendly environment, family environment, all those kind of things we're very protective of. LAPD wants to do the right thing. They don't have the resources. So we've had to supplement it, millions and millions of dollars of private security. And that's a whole other problem because what about the individual landowner in a neighborhood? 
[P167]  that doesn't have the kind of protection they need and they don't have the police force to protect them and running a business becomes impossible. So, and again, those things are just fixable. They really are fixable. So regulations, water, law and order, what other things are giant issues about L.A. that you think need to be addressed? 
[P168]  I think we have to, on the positive side, I want to be more business friendly. I want to invite businesses back to California. I want to invite businesses back to L.A. That's a tough sell. I know. I want to get Elon back to L.A. I don't want him to leave L.A. I've told him that. And I think he would come back. I think all these businesses would come back. Sure, if it was reasonable. If it was reasonable. I mean, they didn't leave because it was awesome. That's what people have to understand. I didn't leave because it was awesome. Right. 
[P169]  this group of people that I thought were inept telling me what to do. Of course. And they gave you, in a weird way, they gave you the incentive to leave and not the incentive to stay. Yes. I want to give people the incentive to stay. Start your business. Grow your business. Raise your family. Let's protect you. Clean the streets. You know, all of those basic things are really important. And again, Joe, maybe I'm overly optimistic in it, but it can come back. And I think California, if unleashed, 
[P170]  mighty powerhouse. It could really change the direction of this whole country. The innovation that we have in California, the technical knowledge, what's happening in our universities, some of the best in the world, what's happening in the tech field with AI, it's all based here in California. And you've got to let that flourish. Set the platform that's encouraging these youngest, brightest minds to come here and start your business and do the right thing. 
[P171]  You're absolutely right. I've talked to a lot of the tech people. They want a different leadership that is supporting the growth of technology that's going to change the world. It's going to happen somewhere. We saw it happen in China with their new AI company. And we better be prepared to be the best at it. And we have to provide the platform to do that. So in order to incentivize people, 
[P172]  If they wanted to come back to California, you've got these enormous taxes. Right. So something has to be done on a state level, not just on a city level. That's right. To address that. That's right. So how do you address that? You should have competitive tax rates. I don't know why California needs to tax people much higher than any other state. Why would you? The cost of operating a state, you know, you've got very sophisticated states, very dense states. It's a matter of setting priorities. 
[P173]  to look at the tax code and make it fairer. We've got the highest gas costs in the country. Why does a gallon of gas in California cost more than a gallon of gas in California? Well, isn't that because in California you're required to sell gas that's refined in California? I don't know if that's the case. See if that's the case, Jamie. But I think the gas in California is also highly taxed. Of course. Why wouldn't they be? This is the question, though, Rick. It's like, where's all this money going? I don't know. It's an insanely high tax rate, 
[P174]  yet you don't have any money to fix the power lines. You've got this insanely high tax rate, but you can't clean up the homeless problem, even though you're throwing a lot of money on it. Where's that money going? I don't know. It's not going to the school system. They need to get these super nerds that are on top of this Department of Government efficiency and set them loose. Set them loose on California. We've got a lot of smart people in California, along with them, that really want to help the system. And I think the minute you bring some really smart people... 
[P175]  Foundation. You look at the list of people that are donating their time and talent. They're just brilliant people. I made one phone call to each of them. Would you give me your time and talent? I don't want a dollar from you. Yes, I'm in. Whatever it is, I'm in. And that's what we need to do more of is have the elected officials have the courage and the competency to reach out and get the smartest people in different industries to come 
[P176]  and help get their ideas and then implement them. That's the greatest form of government. Whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, it doesn't really matter if you've got great ideas. And if you're a big thinker, that's what I would do. That's what I am doing. But on a state level, like the taxes for the state, that would have to be addressed by the governor, right? The governor and the legislature, yeah. Yeah. What could be done about that? I think you've got to rebuild it. 
[P177]  Joe, I don't want to give you a specific proposal here, but it doesn't need to be as high as it is in order to operate the state of California if the state of California has their priorities right of what they're spending money on. And by the way, the best way, and we learned this from Reagan, to raise revenue for the government is to allow businesses and families to grow and create jobs and industries, not to suppress them. Right. 
[P178]  is giving people the incentive to leave, which we've seen, right? The exodus. If you start giving people a rate that allows them to be benefited by staying in the state of California, that business will grow and California is going to make more revenue. It's not rocket science. The economy grows. People have more money. It's better for everybody. And you get some jobs. You get people off the streets. This whole thing starts changing the dynamic. How great would that be? It would be pretty incredible. I just don't want to get my hopes up. Let's do it. 
[P179]  Come on. Don't leave me. Come on. Don't leave me. I think it's possible. It's just a daunting task. It is a daunting task. But, okay, I'm not throwing flowers at you. Look at what you've accomplished in your career. That was a daunting task. Yeah, but I didn't think about it. It just sort of lucked out. It wasn't luck. It was a little bit of luck. Everybody's got a little bit of luck. For sure. It was a hell of a lot of hard work, and you were very focused, and you had your head down, and you just kept going forward. So it can be done.

[P1] ﻿ Good to see you, sir. Thanks for having me. My pleasure. Thanks for being here. It is a terrible time for Los Angeles. And unfortunately, you did not win. I wanted you to win. Thank you. I was rooting for you. Thank you. It's just the politics in L.A. are it's almost like watching people. 
[P2]  who are in a cult who are being confronted by the cult experts who are telling them, hey, this is all crazy and fake and you're ruining your life. And they're like, no, no, no, I think it's going to work out. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of things that aren't working out. Yeah. There's a lot of things that are. I mean, listen, I know like you spending time and living in L.A., it's an amazing city. It's amazing. And when I ran for office, as much as I loved L.A., I actually fell in love with it more 
[P3]  I got to see places that I wouldn't normally see. And so it was really amazing. And people and the diversity and the dearness of so many neighborhoods and people. But what's happened to L.A. over the last decade is just tragic. And people are paying huge consequences for it. And it's sad to watch. So if you get to the heart of it, like if you did, if you won and you became the mayor of L.A., 

[P8]  I believe that you either lead, follow, or get out of the way. And I really admire people who lead. And I wouldn't mind being a little bit controversial if it's in the interest of doing what's in the best interest of the residents. Well, that's what I enjoyed about your campaign, and that's what I was really hopeful about, is that it seemed like you were not running for mayor because you wanted to be the mayor. You were running for mayor because you're a businessman, and you realized that this was not being run like a successful business. 
[P9]  You knew how to run a successful business. You knew the difference. And L.A. is just constantly plagued by this crony political movement. The same people, same type of people shuffling in and out. And it's just nothing ever changes. Yeah. And again, to give you a little bit of background, I am so indebted to L.A. It sounds a little bit corny, but, you know, my paternal and maternal grandparents, 

[P12]  to the city that gave me so much. And by the way, all the problems that we've got, you can fix them with a little bit of backbone, a little bit of smarts. If you're equipped right, bring together some really smart people. You can fix everything. And to your point, what happened when I was tied at the end of the race and actually a little bit ahead? You know, Biden flies into campaign. Kamala flies into campaign. Pelosi, Bernie. 
[P13]  And at the end of the day, when we're 10 days before Election Day, they finally convinced Obama to do a message. And so the system is so it's a closed loop. Right. And the idea that somebody was going to come in the tent that's an outsider was horrifying to them. And, you know, we would laugh about it as a family. It's like you might as well just load up Air Force One all at one time and bring everybody out. 

[P60]  I think the politics have changed. 

[P131]  There's one way that's good and there's one way that's evil. And there's the right wing people that want to be fascist, totalitarian dictators and they just want the wealthy to get wealthier and they want the poor to starve. And then you have the left wing side that has this idea of compassionate care and letting everybody be themselves and let people camp out and let, you know, and we need to treat people like human beings and they're not homeless. They're the unhoused and you start reframing things. 
[P132]  Just a bunch of nonsense. And unfortunately, these people are all conditioned to think that everybody opposed to them hates civil rights, hates women's rights, hates gay rights. They're right wing, hardcore, fascist assholes. What we need is someone. This is one of the things that made me happy about you, is that you need someone who appeals to people's sense of kindness and caring and, you know, being a progressive person. 
[P133]  terms of like social issues. Right. But yet understands human nature and understands business like that. You have to do things if you want to change things. You can't just throw money at it. You can't just have a bunch of people that are just bullshitting and not getting anything done. And this is the problem with L.A. that we see. Well, there's there's no doubt. But but don't you think that is changing now? Right. We've talked about that. I think it's changing. I think it's changing. 
[P134]  way. I mean, if you just give them a couple of good years, they'll be convinced that, you know... We got to fight that good fight, though, Joe. We got to fight that good fight. There's too much at risk. There is too much at risk. I do think... It all really depends on how successful Trump is in this four years that he has and the structure that he sets up and how he can kind of... If it really shows people that, hey, guess what? Gay people aren't losing rights. Hey, guess what? Women aren't losing rights. Hey, guess what? Civil rights 
[P135]  aren't being eroded. This is not what's happening. And then the whole country benefits. If we see GDP go up, if we see homelessness go down, that would be amazing. If that happens, then maybe people could wake their mind up to the fact that you're not in this binary system and that you really shouldn't be a part of a team. You should be a part of Team America. And Team America is like we want the whole thing to be better. Everybody. All of us. Wouldn't that be great? It'd be amazing. It can be done. And it can be done. 
[P136]  It could be. Most people, I think, are reasonable, kind people. Most people. Yes. But I think people get trapped in ideologies. And California is one of the better examples of a place that's just trapped. You're either a Democrat or you're a fucking asshole. That's how you look at it. You know? Oh, God. That's how people look at it. Yeah, I think there's a lot of that. There's a lot of that.

主题：洛杉矶重建与发展的挑战及对策

输入内容：
[P140]  blueprint to the city of LA and say, you know, here's the 10 things you need to do. And it should only take, I mean, that's what we're doing. This new foundation I launched with a bunch of really smart thought leaders in industry have come together. We launched it yesterday just to go tackle problems. Don't tell me what the problem is without the solution. You know, I just live by that. And there is a solution to every problem. It may not be the solution you want, but there's a solution out there. So work towards it. 
[P141]  And I'll give you an example. You know, I've been pushing since the fires. We've got to underground all the power lines. You can't go rebuild the Palisades or Altadena the way it was built 70 years ago. Right. It'd be insane. It's insane. So underground the power lines, redo the water mains, redo the higher fighter system, blah, blah, blah. And I get this pushback. We don't have the money. We don't have the time. You just had the largest urban disaster in the history of the United States. 
[P142]  billion dollars worth of damage, and you're telling me you don't have the money to do the right thing? Didn't we just have the largest infrastructure bill in history passed about a year ago? We must have the money, and we'll find the money, but that can't stop you from doing what's right. So this organization I put together is to go be the advocate for those homeowners, to be the advocate for those business people that lost their businesses, and work alongside 
[P143]  government and say, listen, we'll solve the problem for you and hand the blueprint to you. And then we're going to hold you accountable to implement it. What is the answer when they say we don't have the money? If you have California, which is just insanely enormous economy and a very high tax rate. One of the highest. That's right. So you have high taxes. So you have an enormous economy. That means you've got a lot of money. Right. So where's the money going? Where the money's gone, I can't tell you. 
[P144]  surplus in California. Now we have a deficit. So if that happens at your home or my home, that means we mismanaged our money. It's pretty simple. Yeah. In solving the problem for the Palisades or Altadena on the electric issues or the infrastructure issues, listen, the city has bonding authority. Department of Water and Power has bonding authority. There's federal grants. There's state grants. There's private capital. We're going to go solve that and give some answers to the 
[P145]  But my point is the answer can't be let's not do what's right. We've done enough of that. The answer has to be we're going to go do this and now we're going to solve how to pay for it. And we're going to do it quickly to get people back in their homes and start building again. And I believe we can bend the curve. If somebody thinks it's going to take five years, let's go figure out how we get it done in two years. This is where private enterprise needs to come in and help the government. 
[P146]  because the government alone can't fix this problem. It's too big. They work too slow. You need innovation and entrepreneurship that private enterprise brings. We saw that in COVID with Project Warp Speed and getting the medicines that were needed at the time. We saw it at 9-11 on getting the rebuilding done. And we need to implement the same thing in Los Angeles to get the city rebuilt because it's an impact on the American economy to have the size of two Manhattans. 
[P147]  Two Manhattans burned down. That's how big it is. Can you imagine that? That's insane. 14,000, 15,000 structures burned. It's so hard for people to imagine that. I just went back. Like I was telling you, I was there a couple weeks ago for the UFC. Yeah. And, you know, you see it. And when you're flying over, it just doesn't even make sense. Yeah. We showed the drone footage as well of the Palisades. It doesn't make sense. It's so much devastation. Altadena's gone. Gone. Gone. 
[P148]  You know, Altadena, my friend Jimmy Dore was just talking about this the other day in a video. It was this beautiful, like, nice neighborhood. Oh, yeah. Tree-lined streets. Yeah. Cottage homes. Dear, sweet neighborhood. And gone. Yeah, gone. One of the nice neighborhoods, like, a beautiful neighborhood to drive through. Yeah. It's gone. And those people mostly, Joe, as you know, so many of them, there's no safety net. Right. I mean, very moderate income. Right. 
[P149]  class, hardworking class people. And I've been telling all the elected officials, you've got to have programs that start supporting people because they are down and out. They have nowhere to go. And we've got to do something to help them, you know, day to day to live. One of the things that was bothering me was they were talking about replacing all those beautiful streets that were filled with single family homes with big apartment buildings. And then it would just 
[P150]  ruin that area. Can't do it. Yeah. Can't do it. It's wrong. Yeah. This is not the time to be reimagining anybody's neighborhood off the backs of the devastation and the pain. I've been really vocal about that. And this is, you know, this is the creep you get, what you're talking about, this social justice. Well, now let's say in the Palisades, let's start building a whole bunch of low-income housing. I'm all for low-income housing. I'm building workforce 
[P151]  housing for our employees that are low income because I want to make sure they have a home. So I'm all into that. But now is not the time to do it in a neighborhood that's been devastated. And there's also you're going to have people that won't be able to move back to their neighborhood because they may not be wealthy, but they may make more money than what is required to move into a low income apartment. They can't move back. Don't do that. 
[P152]  that. That's not fair. If you want to do that, what I've told the elected officials is provide an incentive, not a requirement. If you build some low-income units in an apartment building you're replacing, let me back up. So we have this crazy law in the city of Los Angeles. The crazy law in the city of Los Angeles is something to this effect. I may not get it exactly right. If you tear down an existing apartment building that's market rate, 
[P153]  you have to replace it with low-income housing. Okay. All of it? Maybe it's not all of it. I think it's the majority of it. But whatever the number is, okay? My point is when you do that, you provide a disincentive to reinvest in the city. Yeah. So let's turn it around and provide an incentive. Say if you close, knock it down and rebuild, or it's burned down in the Palisades and want to rebuild, 
[P154]  bonus density and allow that person to build more to compensate them for providing housing that is low income, right? It just seems to be more fair. How would you do that? How does that work? Well, let's say you have a 12-unit apartment building that burnt down in the Palisades. Instead of requiring low-income housing for, let's say, 20%, 30%, 40% of it, say instead of building 12, we're going to let you build 20 units. And out of the 20 units, give us 
[P155]  units that are low-income housing, whatever the numbers are. But let's have governments start thinking about an incentive-based system, right? I mean, you look at your life or my life or the people that work here, the harder you work, the more that you do, you're more rewarded, right? You're not required to work harder. You're incentivized to work harder or work smarter. And I think if we build that kind of thinking into government, 
[P156]  to provide capital, to provide investment, especially on the rebuilding, you can have some social policies that are very important and very good, like low income. What I would even say is, why don't we give an incentive to build workforce housing in the Palisades and Altadena, where the workforce housing goes to the first responders, firefighters, police, and teachers? 
[P157]  they're serving. As you know, L.A. is so expensive, most of the cops drive two hours to get home and two hours to get to work. Same with the firefighters. You want them to be in the neighborhood they serve. That's a great public policy. Do it around an incentive. Especially in a place like the Pacific Palisades, I think people deeply resent the idea of being forced to have any kind of low-income housing. The idea is that it's hard to live in the Palisades. It's expensive. It's beautiful. It's an incredible piece of land. 
[P158]  or it was before the fires devastated it. It was a glorious place to live. And it was very difficult to afford to live there. So the people that made the most money were the ones who could buy the homes there. They don't want someone to open up low-income housing in the same neighborhood that's very difficult to live in. The whole idea is that you make enough money where you could live in a place that's very difficult to live in, but it's beautiful and it's really safe. And that's what the Palisades was. They don't want this to be replaced with low-income housing. 
[P159]  housing. They don't want incentives for it to be replaced with low-income housing. Yeah, I don't know, Joe. I think there's people, I think there's a lot of people that would be very excited to have workforce housing, especially if you tie your workforce housing into first responders. And I think there's people that would allow... That's different, though. That's different than apartment buildings. Yeah, but even in an apartment setting, I think it can work. I mean, listen, I think there's people in the Palisades that would very much welcome 
[P160]  affordable housing, low-income housing. I certainly wouldn't. I'm a big landowner in the Palisades. But what I don't like about it is the requirement off the backs of people who have lost everything. That's just not right. That's not the time to do it. If you want to go rezone stuff, let the place get rebuilt and let people get back on their feet and then go have that discussion. It's a timing issue on it, in my opinion. But listen, there's a lot of issues the city's got to tackle to get these places. 

[P190]  zero interest in getting involved myself. Is this where your interests end though? Is it just mayor stuff or do you ever look bigger than that? I don't know. You know, right now, honestly, I was looking at a lot of, a couple of different options. Um, and then when January 7th hit with the fire, the world sort of stopped and I want to spend a lot of time right now trying to get it rebuilt. There's going to be time for politics for me for sure. Um, it's probably not right now. So you think like one day, like governor one day, like maybe, 
[P191]  President. Well, I don't. Come on. Come on, Rick. You know what I want to do? I look at it and I don't mean this in a morbid way. I mean it in a positive way. I'm at the I'm sort of at the back nine of my life. Right. And I've had an incredible life. And so what can I do like that's really meaningful at this point? And I enjoy public service a lot. I enjoyed when I worked for three different mayors. 
[P192]  do want to do something at some point. But the question for me is, where is the place that I can do the most good? And have a good time doing it, by the way, because I like having fun. And where does that intersect? And so as time goes on, I'll figure that out. And whether it's the governor or whether it's the mayor, I'm not quite sure. But I want to do something at some point. But now I really want to get the place rebuilt. Let's get moving. What does that involve? 
[P193]  You wanted to get the place rebuilt. So how long is this woman still going to be the mayor for? Well, she's there for, you know, I think about 18 months or so. And she already announced before the fires she's going to run for reelection. But we'll see how that plays out. As a private citizen, it's this group that I put together that's going to work really closely, pushing the city, finding solutions, sort of calling out when they're not doing what they need to be doing. 
[P194]  And I'm hopeful that that's going to be really effective. And like I said, bending the curve, shortening the timeline to get people in. And that's going to take most of my time and most of my day. I got a small, mighty staff that I hired for it. I'm going to fund it myself. I'm going to use all the resources from my company and the talent we have in the company to help find answers to rebuild it. We got guys like, you know, Joe Lonsdale is a part of that group, one of the biggest thinkers around. 
[P195]  Patterson's, you know, one of the great Gensler architectural firms. Everybody's donating time and talent. And so we want to push the needle on this thing. And then politics will come down the road. We'll figure that out. Well, that sounds wonderful. But it seems to me that, like, unless you're at the cockpit, unless you're, you know, controlling the direction of the city, it's going to be very hard to really change things in a meaningful way. It's a good challenge for sure. 
[P196]  the leadership that's there now. And the problem is now. Right. Right. So I got to figure out how I help the leadership be successful. Has the leadership adjusted their perspective based on this enormous failure of the fire? Because it seems like politically that's a giant handicap for them, right? Obviously, it was a huge disaster. So in order to get reelected, you have to give these people some faith that you've recognized that you've made some errors and you're going to do things differently. 
[P197]  I haven't heard that. I haven't heard that. Oh, that sounds crazy. Yeah. But, you know, I'll be really honest with you. I'm always honest with you, with everybody. When you're a leader and you weren't around to help prevent the problem, probably highly and likely you're going to be able to fix the problem if that was your judgment. Yeah. Right? Right. So if your judgment was, I'm going to go out of town when this catastrophic event is about to hit, 
[P198]  the city that I'm in charge of, you probably don't have the judgment to get it fixed. I hope I'm wrong. But I'm going to do whatever I can to help because the problem is bigger than the politics and the problem is bigger than her. And the people that are suffering shouldn't be suffering because of her or anything that she did or who she appointed that failed in their job. We've got to do a workaround. 
[P199]  option I've got right now. And that's what we're going to do. And that's what I'm going to do. Well, that's very practical. Is there anything else that you would think of that needs to be discussed about L.A. and that you think could be fixed? You know, we cover the regulations. Yeah. What about desalination? Absolutely should be done. Great idea. I tried it when I was the head of Department of Water and Power. Yeah. Got fought by every environmental group there is. Why? Do they think we're going

[P18]  But the real question is, why? And why is so much money spent on it and no results? We've covered it on this podcast that there's people that are bureaucrats that work for this department of homelessness, and they're making a quarter million dollars a year. And they have no incentive whatsoever to make anything better because it doesn't hurt them. They're not paid based on whether or not they clean up the homeless issue. They're just paid. So the longer the homeless issue goes on, the more they keep their job. 
[P19]  And it's a profitable job. And they just rant on and on about we need housing. Like, that's not the problem. But, you know, I had a plan and I'm confident my plan would have worked. Let's talk about housing for a minute. L.A. and L.A. County, they put in a tax called HHH to build 10,000 units. At least about a year ago, I think they had maybe short of 1,000 units built. 
[P20]  That's amazing. Over 10 years. Over 10 years. I'm amazed they built one. Yeah, I know. But you know what they built them for? $800,000 a unit. Wow. That was the cost of it. If you go to the sector, the nonprofit sector that's actually doing amazing work with the homeless, like down on Skid Row, Ground Zero, they're building on average $300,000 a unit. 
[P21]  waste on top of waste. It's ridiculous. So yeah, you're right. Very little is happening. Almost no housing is being built by the government, even though they have massive taxes. We got another tax called ULA. When you sell your home, you have to pay another 5% over $5 million. So there's taxes on top of taxes. There is a solution to the homeless. So let's give, I'll just give you an example. There's a company called Boxable outside of Vegas, and they're building units that are five, six hundred, 
[P22]  square feet. On average, they're about 60,000, 70,000 a unit. This young guy figured out how to build up basically a production line to knock these things out. And when I was campaigning, I said to him, when I win, I'm going to give you a contract for 30,000 units. And there's so much open space, Joe, in and around Los Angeles that's controlled by the city. And we're going to start getting people in homes, getting them taken care of, giving them the service they need. 
[P23]  You can't have open drug dealing on the streets. We welcome it. And if you look around MacArthur Park, the great old Langer's Deli, and the poor owner, Norm Langer's, who basically said, after 70 years, I've got to close my restaurant. It's terrible. Terrible. Amazing old place. And then, you know, Mayor Bass promised, I'm going to be down there. I'm going to clean it up. We're going to fix it. It hasn't changed in six months since she said that. It can be cleaned up. It can be fixed. You've got to have some backbone. 
[P24]  A lot of it is a mental health issue, correct? Very much so. Probably half. And drug addiction. Drug addiction, a lot of that comes from mental health issues as well, right? Yes. So what could be done? I mean, you're dealing with an enormous population of people that have this issue. It's probably closer to 100,000 in L.A. County. Maybe. I mean, that's the high estimates, right? So let's say 70,000 to 100,000 people. You have a lot of people. 
[P25]  results with helping these people with their mental health issues and helping these people with their drug addiction issues. I think you start first by enforcing the law and don't allow the sale of drugs on the street and holding the drug dealers accountable. Not just the sale, but the open use. I mean, meth, cooking meth right out in front of everybody. You're right, all the above. I mean, literally in downtown, there's tents that are run by the drug dealers where everybody knows to go to get their drugs. So you got to start there. 
[P26]  But I'm a big believer that government alone can't solve major problems, right? Right. And you've got organizations downtown that are really doing great stuff. Downtown Women's Center is doing great stuff. Union Rescue Mission, great stuff. And they're bringing people in. They're giving them the help and the treatment they need for drug addiction and mental health care. And they're giving them housing. Scale those people up. Take the dollars we're spending and wasting on the city trying to do it. 
[P27]  And start pushing dollars to organizations that have a proven track record of success. And their success, Joe, is like a 90% success rate. And scale it. Why go reinvent a model that's already working well? And there's probably a dozen organizations downtown that are doing a good job. And what are they doing? And you do it at a fraction of the cost. I already interrupted you. Do it at a fraction of the cost. These people that are being successful, how are they doing it? What's their method? 
[P28]  down there and spend time during the campaign. And since then, because we've been supportive of their efforts as a family, they actually welcome people as they are. No judgment. Downtown Women's Center. Tonight in Los Angeles, there'll be about 20,000 women that will go to sleep on the street. And the majority of those women will in some form or fashion be abused, sexually abused, right? It's terrible that we allow this. It's a crime we allow this. But an example of Downtown Women's Center, 
[P29]  They accept them the way they are, mental health condition, drug addiction condition. They have embedded services downtown in their facility. They have housing there for them, and they give them the treatment. And it's happening in real time. And they're very effective doing it. Like I said, they've got about a 90% success rate. So they have highly educated, skilled workers that know how to react and deal with the people on the street. That's what we need more of. 
[P30]  I don't think you need to build new big institutions. What I do think you need to do is cut all the red tape, start building quickly, funding these organizations, and fund them quickly. If you talk to Downtown Women's Center, it will take them an average of six years to build new housing. Six years. That's crazy. It's crazy. And it's in Skid Row. It's not like you're building in a sensitive environmental area. Right. Right? Right. Give the damn permits. 

[P32]  So this was 20 years ago, 22 years ago. And even back then it was bananas. Come see it now. Oh, I've heard. Well, we watched that documentary. Is it the Carlisle Hotel, Jamie? I think so. One of the documentaries on one of the old downtown hotels. And it went into the history of Skid Row. And what Skid Row was, they would take people, they would arrest them for being vagrants somewhere else, and they'd bring them to Skid Row and just leave them there and basically box them in and leave them in this area. 
[P33]  They had, you know, soup kitchens and places where they could get food and they were allowed to just sleep on the street. And so they just stayed there. And so they essentially, instead of fixing this problem of homeless people and mentally ill people, they just pushed them into this one area. They said, let's just, you know, we got a spot. We could just stick them. We could turn our back on it. And then, of course, every business in that area got devastated. All those hotels, glorious old classic hotels. I mean, in fact, the Morrison Hotel just caught fire because vagrants were living in it. 
[P34]  And it's gone now. So these methods that these people are using that are successful, what are they? What are they doing? Well, what they're doing is they're giving them the treatment they need. Now, Union Rescue Mission has a different approach. Union Rescue Mission, you know, that's a faith-based organization. Hugely successful. It's overflowing. They can't accommodate everybody. They need a lot more funding. But they don't allow anybody to use drugs or alcohol the minute they check in. 
[P35]  get an apartment. The other organizations that I'm aware of allow them to continue that, but they're required to go on programs to get off the drugs, to get the mental health care that they need. So they have skilled workers. They're literally daily classes. There's protocols. There's requirements of the residents on what they can do and what they can't do. To give them structure. They give them structure. That's right. That's a great word. You're exactly right. They give them structure. They give them training. They give them hope. And they give them a path forward. 
[P36]  I've always said this. Let's assume your number's right. There's 100,000 homeless on the streets in L.A. County, whatever the number is. People say you can't solve the whole problem. Why don't we start with solving half of it? Yeah, that'd be nice. Yeah. Let's solve for the group of people that for whatever reason are down and out, lost their job, lost their apartment, 
[P37]  You've got more families on the streets now, Joe, than ever before. Let's start with that group and let's help them very quickly. Give them training. Give them a job. Give them a path forward. And then you sort of work through the system. But we're not even doing that. Right. And so and now you've had the fires. The estimate is there's another 180,000 people in L.A. that are homeless. Is that insane to think about? It's insane. 

[P117]  school in the middle of the heart of the worst part of Los Angeles with the homelessness in Skid Row. And it's called Paralos Ninos. And my wife and I have been supporting that school for over 30 years now. Outside the doors is the biggest sea of inhumanity of homeless people just strewned out on the street, drugged out, all the terrible mental health conditions. 
[P118]  door and it's beautiful and caring and loving. And this school that we support, there's a series of schools, takes in children from six months to five years old. The parents are all working parents, below the poverty line working parents. So they're working in the sweatshops, whatever the case may be. They're living down on Skid Row in apartments, two or three families in an apartment, working their tail off to just survive. 
[P119]  to be able to get their child in this school that costs them nothing. It's fully supported. Those are the dearest, sweetest children in the world. We love going down there. Our kids have worked down there since they were little kids. We do a Christmas party for them. And what gives us such joy is seeing the hope in their eyes. And I know it sounds corny, but it's such an important path that we've got to get our elected officials to be more supportive of that and get more of these kind of schools and give more of these families 
[P120]  to do well because they want to do well. But the system is frankly against them. And that's what I wanted to change more than anything. Well, let's talk about that. This school, there's no reason why they should have to encounter that environment outside that school. You're right. There's no reason. This is not nuclear waste. This is not something that can't be cleaned up for 5 million years. We have to leave it alone. This is human beings. This is human devastation out there in the street. The fact that these kids 
[P121]  have to encounter that first of all what does that do for your sense of hope and your your future of the world like this is what you're seeing every day like you you absorb that from your environment the the sadness and the devastation all around you and you're seeing people with lost lives out in the street right in front of your school when you're a young kid and you're a developing mind and that's the environment that you encounter all the time like that is gonna fuck your head up forever yeah it's very tough and then there's the question of the sweatshops like 
[P122]  Why? Why? How come people that work their tail off constantly have to live three, four families in an apartment? Like what the hell is going on there? I agree. Yeah. But that's what that's what I'm saying. That's what I think we got to start fixing. Yes. Right. And if you start fixing that now, your point is right. These kids having to see that every day, they're being yelled at, you know, by people as they're walking through the doors and all that. It's terrible. 
[P123]  God that school is there because if that school wasn't there, they have nothing. They got nothing. Right. They're on the street. No, it's amazing. I mean, the problem outside the school, that should be fixed. That should be a public health issue. I mean, if you're worried, the future human beings, if you want to look at this country and you want to make America a great place, what you want is less people that are going to lose at life. You want less losers. The best chance you can have less 
[P124]  losers is start them off on a good path when they're young. That's right. Well said. And if you're starting them off on a good path when they're young, if you're giving them the tools that they need to have a successful life, giving them hope, giving them examples of good people that you could strive to be like, what would Mike do? I'll probably want to do what he does. He would get up and get this done. And I admire that person. And having people around you that are examples of someone who lives a life that you admire. 
[P125]  people peeing on themselves and throwing up and walking through the streets just covered in cardboard shelters and tents. That's not hope. You're not seeing good examples. So what are you depending on for your examples? That's a travesty. That should be cleaned up immediately. So let's talk about that. What could be done for Skid Row, which is probably the worst example of LA's homeless problem? 
[P126]  It's the same thing with any place else that we talked about. You have to, I believe, supercharge these organizations like Aparo Los Ninos that are doing well, that are really changing lives, like the Downtown Women's Center, like Common Concern. There's Union Rescue Mission. There's dozens of them. Where do you put all those people? You've got all these people on the streets. You've got 100,000 people on the streets. There's endless land. There's endless land. The city of Los Angeles has something like over 300 or 400 parcels of land

[P15]  But then once we launched and we sold them, then it's like, okay, now we need to spend a lot more money. So we just started going to Bucky's like every day and spending thousands and thousands of dollars. And they have hundreds of different products. And then, you know, every t-shirt, they have six different sizes and they have 50 different types of t-shirts. So that's 300 different SKUs just for t-shirts. And then they have pajamas and hats and everything. So it was very complex. And it took us about two years to really get our arms around the logistics of this business. 
[P16]  Yeah, the logistics, I think, are fascinating. Let's talk about like those first month logistics. Guys, stay tuned because we're going to dive into like starting your own basically retail like arbitrage like type system here. What were those logistics like? Was it just you and your family doing it? Do you have a partner doing it? Because you're doing a lot of stuff here. You're putting on your website. You're grabbing the supplies. I'd love to hear those logistics just to get people thinking here. Yeah. So thankfully, we already owned a logistics business. So we had a small warehouse with shelving and employees.

And, you know, we had this business that we owned right here, Fulfilling Products, but then we have this other business where we're fulfilling products on behalf of other customers. So we were always kind of battling these two product lines and it made it pretty difficult. But, I mean, we could have launched out of my garage. We could have launched from home. It just would have been even messier.

[P26]  that's worked well. Yeah. I'm curious, like, where are you getting these seasonal design like t-shirts? Is it at like the TJ Maxx's or like, where is that at? These are Bucky shirts that I'm referring to here. Yeah. I think it's just important to like give context there. I'm like where these are actually coming from and everything like that. But what are like the startup costs of this? I know you spent $3,000. Is that really all you need to get started? Could you get started with less and build from there? Would love to hear Chris's advice. Yeah. It just depends on the industry and on the types of products that you're selling. Ours costs 
[P27]  much it costs to buy one of everything for Bucky's, but that's very unique. I would think in most cases it costs much, much less than that, especially if you have a credit card with a revolving 30-day balance that you could pay off by the end of the 30 days. I would think as little as $200 or $300, especially if you're leaning heavily on Facebook Marketplace. Is that the best place for people to get started is Facebook Marketplace for reselling?

People paid $12 to $17 an hour. We're competing with Amazon, and that's tough to do. We don't have the benefits that Amazon offers. So you kind of have to go hard the other direction and say, we're not Amazon. And no, you don't have those benefits, but we care about you as a human, 
[P21]  listen to music while you work. You can't do that on Amazon. We're going to have pizza Fridays. We're going to play fun games. We're going to have a culture.

Yeah, I love that. Let's talk about more approaches. So someone that's like, okay, I'm dialed into this right now. Chris has got me on the hook.

[P51]  make sure you're focusing on like the right thing with each company? Because obviously you can be spread very thin here. Like what's your secret to managing seven companies? So I go by what's called Parkinson's law. And Parkinson's law, for those listening that don't know, states that work and or tasks expand or contract to fit the time or resources allotted to it. So like if it's kind of like if you go to a buffet, you're going to get a plate that's pretty small because they don't want you to eat too much. 
[P52]  And if you eat from a small plate, you will scientifically eat fewer calories. You have a big plate, you're going to eat more calories because that's just Parkinson's law. And another way of looking at it is, let's say I like to clear my inbox every Friday, inbox zero every Friday. Well, let's say I go to the beach with my family on Friday and my kids want to go play volleyball with me in the sand. You know, I usually take eight hours to clear my inbox and I have one hour to do that. I'm going to get it done. I'm just going to get it done. And the emails that aren't as important, I'm just going to mark them as read. 
[P53]  because they're not that important. And you're in high school, you have a month to do a project, you do the night before, you're told that you have a project due the next day, you're going to get it done. So I just like say yes to everything. I overwhelm myself with tasks and the ones that are important naturally get my attention and everything else just falls by the wayside. Interesting. I want to ask this and push back on me if this is too much here, but like, do you like experience like a lot of anxiety with like all the companies that you're like running with? Because for me,

输入内容：
[P12]  because it's inefficient to ship, you know, one bag of chips across the country. So they need to market up a bunch, but they take customer service very seriously and they don't want to ruin the goodwill that they've built up with their customers. Yeah, it is such an experience going to Bucky's because you have like a hundred gas pumps along, like that's a whole like retail store and everything as well. So you're launching this online. It's an e-commerce like Bucky's store, essentially. Let's talk about like that first month. Like, did you guys get demand right away or like what led up to successful launch of this? 
[P13]  We launched by cold emailing reporters. We wanted it to go viral. We thought it'd be a good story. That was kind of our thesis was either this will turn into a partnership or a business or just a good story. So we started emailing reporters. They loved it. They reached out to Bucky's for comment. They put us in touch with them and they wanted to be sure that we didn't infringe on their trademarks, that everyone on our website was clear that we did not represent Bucky's, that we were an unaffiliated independent third party. So we made a few changes on our website 
[P14]  Then a bunch of articles were written about us and we went viral and it was timed just right. This was 2020, November, right before Christmas, big fourth quarter rush. And we did about 200,000 of sales in those first 30 days. Let me emphasize that $200,000 in like the first 30 days is insane, but you only bought one product of like each. So are you like scrambling to go to Bucky's like restock here? Like what's that backstory there?

And that's how I made my money as a nine or 10 year old. That is so, so cool. And that has led to a lot of stuff, but important part of your journey is going to Hungary and then coming back.

[P54]  I'm a newer entrepreneur. I'm going like my second full calendar year being an entrepreneur. To me, running like eight, seven companies is like overwhelming. I'd be curious, like, do you experience that anxiety with like how you build your schedule? I do from time to time, not regularly. And I have operating partners for all of my businesses, which on one hand is like really nice. But on the other hand, it means that like the 5% of the most stressful things from all of them make their way up to me. You know, I get the worst of the worst, but everything else is outsourced. And so there was, 
[P55]  One time, like a year or two ago, when I was just driving home from the office, a bunch of stuff weighing on me, and I had a panic attack. And I didn't even know what it was. I had heard of it, but I had never experienced it. I had never struggled with anxiety or anything. And my just heart started racing. I started feeling sick. I was shaky and it wouldn't go away. And I didn't know what it was. And so I tried to manage that. And it's not all roses. I woke up at 3.30 this morning. I didn't set my alarm for that. I just started thinking about work when I woke up to go pee. And that comes with the territory.

[P5]  Yeah, so when I was 11, I moved from Utah to Central Florida. My dad got a job at Kennedy Space Center. It was a big culture shock. Went to high school there. Didn't really do any side hustles or businesses. I just had a bunch of odd jobs, waiting tables, busing tables, delivering pizzas, pest control, lawn care, you name it. And then I went on a mission from my church to Central Europe. So I had to learn Hungarian, and I had a mission companion, a white shirt and tie, and we would knock doors all day every day for two years in post-communist Europe. 
[P6]  Gosh, that's interesting. What did that experience teach you? Because going from door to door is, that treats you a lot about resilience and getting no and a door slammed in your face quite a bit. I added it up and I was rejected about like 23,000 times in two years because that's all we did. We knocked doors and we talked to people on the street and asked them to talk about our church. And it did a lot of things. It taught me to like not care about failure and rejection, which helped the business. And it taught me to be appreciative of America. 
[P7]  I took it for granted, like I'm sure a lot of other people do. And there's just no opportunity over there in Hungary. Didn't matter how smart or hardworking you were. And so I came back with this newfound contrast of this great country that we live in, which is this desire and drive and motivation that I'd never had before. So speaking of drive, speaking of motivation, that led you to start Texas Snacks. And that's what the base of our conversation is going to be today. So let's talk about Texas Snacks. What is it? What's the premise of it? And like, what led up to it?

输入内容：
[P35]  to that 30-year-old entrepreneur that has five businesses, you could really get started as your first business on this, which I think is super exciting as well. I want to talk about continuing down that road of, okay, let's just continue with Pete Sullivan just to keep it easy for people. You achieved some early success. You have some good numbers here. What steps should they take to then grow and sustain that business? Is it more product offerings? Is it automations? What would you advise someone? I would advise them to start looking at liquidation auctions. Two websites that I like. 
[P36]  It's called B-Stock, where you can buy Costco returns. A lot of people are turned off by it because you have to have a reseller certificate, but you're looking like $100 and filling out one form. It's not that difficult to get. So bstock.com slash Costco. I've seen people buy a 20-foot container full of treadmills for $1,000. It is stupid because it's either they sell this for next to nothing or they throw it away. So that's a great source. And what's great about that is you can go, 
[P37]  list those treadmills on Facebook Marketplace before you spend a dime, before you buy anything and say, okay, wow, these sell really well. I'm going to buy these. In fact, I can afford to pay a lot more than the current list price. Or you know what? Even if I break even on these, they're not selling. So I'm not buying these. So most people just don't realize how much research you can actually do before having to spend a dime. It's just like so amazing because what excites me about this, I want to double down is anyone could do this, but like, it also sounds like you could do this as like a side hustle in a sense.

[P32]  And I know we talked about sourcing this. I mean, where do you source like a pizza? Let's stick with this example here. Like, where do you source that pizza oven from? Are you looking on Facebook Marketplace at the complete source where you're just going to resell it? Or like, where do you find that source for all of this? Yeah. So one thing that I'll do is I will buy and sell from Facebook Marketplace. So I'll go to Facebook Marketplace and I'll run a search that's over 30 days old. And let's just keep using pizza ovens as an example. 
[P33]  know exactly, you know, after 20 minutes, I kind of know what the market price is. I'll run search for items that have been on Facebook marketplace for a while. And I'll look for listings that have poor description, poor pictures, one or two pictures. And then I'll just know immediately that there's an arbitrage there. So if it's been listed for a while, that means they're more likely to take a low ball offer. If it's been listed for a while, it means it's probably because they have crappy pictures or description. So pizza oven isn't a great example for this because you really need a higher ticket to make it worthwhile. 
[P34]  But all else equal, you could just buy something at a steep discount, take possession of it, take professional pictures of it, upload as many pictures or videos as it will allow you to do. Put a keyword rich description in there and you can sell the same item on the same marketplace for more money because you have more visibility. Yeah. What I love about this strategy is one that was like super tactical. But what I also love about this as well is anyone can really do this. This is like a 15 year old could do this. A six year old could do it. Everyone in between.

主题：Texas Snacks创业起源

输入内容：
[P8]  a 3PL, a third-party logistics business, where we managed all the logistics for e-commerce brands. And at the time, my cousin Kirk and my business partner was visiting from Utah. And we went to a Buc-ee's his first time. We were just talking like, wow, imagine if Buc-ee's sold online because they didn't sell online. And I was like, Kirk, they could be our client. They could be our vendor. We could manage all of their e-commerce forums. We got all excited about it. Cold emailed them. No response. 
[P9]  tried again, no response. So then I was like, Kirk, what if we just did something crazy? We bought one of everything and we took pictures of it all and we launched a website and then just like launched it. Like we just started selling their products for them. So we did. Interesting. So let's talk about, you bought one product of like everything. How much did that cost? And like, what's the markup there for it? Yeah. So that first batch was like $3,000 or so. I brought my wife and four kids. We loaded up all these carts, 
[P10]  a bunch of pictures and we marked it up not nearly enough in the beginning, like 40%. And the fulfillment and shipping costs were pretty high. But today we mark it up closer to 80%, hoping to make like a 15% profit margin. Interesting. So obviously I think there's like a lot to go on with this. I want to ask first like demand for these like Buc-ee's products. And guys, we're both in Texas here. Chris and I are. I mean, if you've never been to Buc-ee's, Buc-ee's is like a whole experience of itself. So I want to talk about like, where does the demand come from? Is it nationwide? Or like, 
[P11]  it's Bucky's products. Yeah. So it's like, it's a really unique company. They only have about 50 locations, but by my best guess, they're privately traded. So no one really knows, but I believe they do about a billion dollars in sales a year from 50 gas stations, which is crazy, but they don't sell online and they sell snacks, but they sell a lot of merch, a lot of shirts. And the reason is good because they can't really sell their products for more than what they sell in store, hoping to make a profit.

[P29]  from other marketplaces. So one thing that I'll do is I'll open an incognito tab in a new browser and I'll go to etsy.com. And I will just kind of see what the homepage is showing me. There's a lot you can learn from algorithms. The algorithm is going to push to you what is already hot. Just like when you create a new TikTok account, TikTok knows nothing about you. It's going to show you videos that have hundreds of millions of views because it doesn't know who you are yet. And then if you start swiping on Theo Vaughn, 
[P30]  or whatever prank videos, it's going to start showing you more of that. And so go to eBay, go to Facebook with brand new accounts, clear your cookies, clear your cash, and just start looking. What's it showing me? And then you can take listings like those and list them yourself. And then you can try, all right, Houston and Dallas are comparable in size and demographic. I'm going to post, this is something, pizza oven. I just bought a pizza oven. I'm going to post a used pizza oven here, used pizza oven here. Oh, okay. 
[P31]  but five inbound messages. This one got 30 clicks, but 15 inbound messages. Interesting. So there's three times higher intent in this market versus this market. So you can run dozens of tests at any given time and the algorithm and the people will just give you all this data that you can say, okay, pizza oven's cool. I'm going to start now that I have the demand because that's the harder part. Now I'm going to go find the supply and find a way to source these because I know that I'll be able to sell them at a profitable price point.

[P22]  or markets with high resale potential. What does that process look like for someone listening? Yeah, so I would start by going to the discount suppliers like TJ Maxx. There's an Ollie's discount outlet and you can download apps where you can scan certain items. Like let's say you see an air fryer. Oh, $30 air fryer. It's on clearance. Let's see what this goes for on Amazon. $80. Interesting. And then you can just learn how to play the arbitrage game and you can list them on Amazon, send them all to Amazon at once. 
[P23]  in one box and send it with the proper labeling and sell them through your account and make a margin on the difference. To me, that's a much more approachable way to sell things online or on Facebook Marketplace because it's more scalable and not dependent on, you know, one big white whale partnership or customer. You can basically buy and sell whatever you want. Yeah. So in simplest terms of how I'm like comprehending this is you're basically finding something at a discount and then just reselling it for a high markup. 
[P24]  I like, just as a game, going to Facebook Marketplace and tracking what is getting a lot of clicks. I'll list dozens of different things for sale just from images that I get from Google Images to see what type of clicks they get. And I'll test different price points in different markets. That's just like a test, like a fun experiment to see where the demand is online. And it's shocking how much you can learn from doing that. Yeah. I want to make it as easy for listeners that want to do this here. 
[P25]  What has been a product that has had high demand that you've seen over the four, whatever, four years, five years that you've been doing this? Probably seasonal shirts because of the fact that they're different every year. New design every year or tumblers as well. These are mass markets. It's things that people need to use and or wear every single day. And every couple months they're coming out like St. Patrick's Day, Valentine's Day, New Year's Eve, new designs. And then every year, new designs of the same season as well.

[P62]  too. Chris, you've been amazing. Let's go to our fan blitz questions. And these are questions submitted from our community. And guys, if you want to join in on world-class entrepreneurs, go to www.youtube.com slash upflip and submit your questions there. But Chris, ready for our last four questions here? Yep. Number one, what's the most surprising item you've ever resold for a profit? Probably a, oh man, a culvert. You know what a culvert is? What is a culvert? Yeah, I don't even know what a culvert is. It's like a metal, 
[P63]  plastic or PVC pipe that you put under a road that water passes through. So I was just driving and I was in the market for a culvert because I have this property and I built a dirt road and I needed a ditch to pass through it. And I saw all these culverts and my city, the city that I live in, was just swapping out their fiber optic cable. And so they had all this culvert that they were just replacing for no reason. And I asked the contractor if I could have it. And he's like, yeah. And I just, I sold it. I got it for free and I sold it for hundreds of dollars. 
[P64]  It's fun. Your mind's always in business. I love that. Always. If you had to start a business today with $500, what would it be? One of two things. I would start flipping stuff on Facebook Marketplace like we've talked about because it's so approachable. It's approachable and it's scalable. And very few things are both. And the other thing would be to start a home service business. Service businesses are awesome. It costs very little to start. Most of them are low-skilled. Tree trimming, painting, drywall, fence, anything like that. 
[P65]  you. That's what we talk about most on Upflip. So you are on the right podcast. Number three, what's one tool or app every retail arbitrage entrepreneur should know or use? Yeah, Zapier. You can connect any software to any software and automate basically anything that you want. You can connect it to ChatGPT and have it answer your emails for you. It's pretty brilliant. Yeah, Zapier is a great one. All right, Chris, last one for you. Biggest mistake you made early on and what did you learn from it? 
[P66]  mistake I made early on is easily going into business with friends, close friends, just because we're friends, right? I advocate going into business with friends, but they need to have a skill that they can bring to the table that can benefit you and the business. Doing business with friends is funner. It's better, but it shouldn't just be because you're close. It should be because they're a killer hard worker. They have a lot of industry expertise that you don't have. They have something that can really add value. 
[P67]  to the outcome. That's so good. Very last question for you. If someone's like, oh my gosh, I want to learn more about Chris. I want to connect with him. Where can they learn more about you and connect with you? Probably at tkopod.com. That's my podcast, the Kerner Office Podcast. 
[P68]  by visiting us at upflip.com slash academy to get started with your first business today. Well, Chris, thank you so much for being here today. I love all the insights. So yeah, thank you so much for being here. Thank you.

[P58]  And I will answer those texts or calls or voicemails when I get time. If there's an emergency, you can call 911. I like it. And I know you talk about your calendar a lot here. So I want to wrap up this episode with basically like two more segments here. This is our last question before we run to our fan blitz. One thing that I love that you're doing on your social media right now, and guys, go check out Chris's social media. I mean, we're talking almost $550,000 on Instagram. We're talking over 100,000 on Twitter. So it's a great social media. One thing you're doing right now is doing like your favorite business ideas for 2025. And we're on day 10 of this right now. 
[P59]  We'll love to hear like so far, like what's been some of your best business ideas for 2025 that people can take on and learn more about. Yeah, that's so hard to ask because I've been putting out three of those videos a day. And so literally I've covered 30 ideas in the first 10 days of the year. But I really like, and I'm going to go look at my own page so I can remember. I really like, it's funny because we're talking about pizza ovens. I posted a video. Did you see it about cooking pizza? 
[P60]  that. Oh, I see it right here. Yeah. So I read this article in the Wall Street Journal about a guy that makes $175,000 a year in net profit. On the weekends, he's a professor selling pizza at a farmer's market, two farmer's markets. He works really hard all day, $175,000 with like 80% margins from a $2,000 pizza oven. He doesn't have a food truck. He doesn't have a restaurant. And it's just like, there's no business too small for me. I don't care. I love business. I don't care if it's porta-potties, 
[P61]  billion dollars, $100. I love turning $1 to $2. So I like the idea of taking a $2,000 pizza oven and going to a farmer's market and selling $20 pizzas that cost you $2 in labor. And personally, as a foodie, I love the taste. And as a business owner, I love the margins. He just released one about doing a huge sandbox environment, like legit sand in a coffee shop. I think that's just such a unique twist and something that I kind of want to do, obviously. Yeah, I know. That sounds fun.

[P46]  hey guys, I can't meet this week because I have to evacuate. So like a nice gesture from us, I think it was a nice gesture, was sending him like a $50 like DoorDash gift card of like, get to your next spot, order. It's $50, but in the long term of him actually signing with us, the whole value is like, sells itself 30X almost. Yeah. We've talked a lot about like identifying products, how to manage those relationships. Another important question that comes to mind here is like shipping and fulfillment. I know you had fulfillment and shipping experience before that. You had a whole company. 
[P47]  those resources available to them. How would you advise them to ship effectively? Yeah, you've got to go about doing it yourself to start. A lot of times business owners are like, well, you know, that's not the best and highest use of my time. I should be marketing and there's valid points to that. But you don't want to train someone on something or outsource anything until you really have your arms wrapped around it. Like, you know, all the tricks of the trade or else you're just going to set yourself up for failure in the future. 
[P48]  scalable way. And then scaling will become a lot easier. Also, when you start to work with like FedEx or UPS with bulk negotiated discounts, you can always go cheaper. Like a lot of times UPS has their published rates and like, these are our retail rates and we're going to give you 60% off. And the average business owner is like, holy cow, I got 60% off. What they don't know is like 90% is pretty standard, you know? So it's like 60% should not prevent you for asking for more because in my experience, 
[P49]  Literally, you just ask and you get it. And it could be the difference between $5,000 a month in shipping costs or $3,500 a month in shipping costs just because you act once. That comes down to like a lot of things of like asking, knowing what to do. We're going to wrap up this segment here and move on to one more that I'm like very excited for that I'm so interested to ask some questions out of just because you're an amazing entrepreneur here. And if you give like one more piece of advice for someone that wants to start in this sector, what would you give them? Test everything. Don't fall in love with a certain niche or product.

[P41]  Chris Foss book, but like any negotiation tips there. I look at it this way. Like if you were going to buy a truck from your dad, is he going to cut you a good deal? Yeah. Like he still needs to make some money from it, but you're going to get about the best deal possible for that truck. And why? Well, it's because you have a relationship. So that's like one end of the spectrum. The other end of the spectrum is a stranger from Facebook marketplace that's selling a truck. You show up, you meet him, you give him an offer. He doesn't know about you. He doesn't care about you, right? 
[P42]  So you're going to get a deal on the other end of the spectrum. So with buying from wholesalers or buying real estate, anything, you just want to move closer to that end of the spectrum. And you can only do that by playing the long game, building relationship with them, not like beating them up over price on day one. In fact, giving them maybe more than they're expecting on day one to buy some goodwill, because that will pay off 10 times more in the future when you actually really need it. Like to save $5 on a pizza oven today is really nothing. 
[P43]  When you're buying hundreds of them and you could save $10 or $20 on each of them, that would really move the needle for you. But people, they have short-term thinking a lot of times and they just try to play hardball on day one and you really can't do that. Is there anything that you do with like suppliers or anything? I know we just had like the holidays here. Like do you send suppliers like Christmas gifts or anything or like customers? I would love to hear that because I think that's a unlock for a lot of entrepreneurs when they don't think about developing these long-term relationships. Yeah, and especially, I mean, in the wholesale game or liquidation game, 
[P44]  A lot of these vendors are, you know, they're six or seven figure relationships. And like, let's say you have a vendor that really likes you and he sells pizza ovens and he's got 50 people in his Rolodex that he can call that he's going to call you because you sent a $50 gift basket for Christmas. But like the fact that you're getting the call first could be worth $100,000, but you sent him a $50 gift basket and that's why you stood out.

[P92]  Beautiful Japanese cooking knife, like handcrafted, handmade in Japan, beautiful, like top notch. And I was like, this is my dream. This is my dream knife. Where did this thing come from? Who sent this to me? It was so random. It was so sharp and so fancy that for many months I was like, I can't use this thing. So it just sat in my drawer. And then recently when I picked up cooking again, I was like, I'm going to start using this knife. And let me tell you, it is unbelievable. 
[P93]  the experience of using a beautiful, beautiful, fancy knife. It's the only knife I use now. I don't need to use any of my other knives because this knife is versatile and so sharp and so good. It just, it, it does it all. I don't need any other knife. Okay. If I were to like want to cut, you know, a loaf of bread or something, I'd need to get out like a large serrated knife. Obviously, you know, there are times when you need other types of knives, but for majority of like cutting, 
[P94]  use this incredible knife. And I think it's something that we often underestimate. Like instead of buying like a beautiful large knife set with like, oh, I just farted. Can you hear it? Did you hear it? I don't know. Anyways, instead of buying a really expensive knife set, buy one really good knife. Do you know what I mean? I don't know. I'm just, I'm all about like the one really good knife, really fancy cooking knife. It's just incredible. 
[P95]  Okay, moving on to frozen peas and carrots. Okay, let me explain. I have never had a particularly hard time eating vegetables. Like I've always pretty much liked vegetables, you know? And my favorite vegetable for a long time was broccoli. And so I would just add broccoli to everything. Like if I would make like a pasta dish or something, I would just like steam some broccoli and throw it in it and mix it in. Or, you know, if I needed a vegetable with my dinner or I wanted a vegetable with my dinner,

[P80]  sweeteners these days and I cannot stomach them. Like my stomach will have a meltdown if I consume aspartame, which is the artificial sweetener in most artificially sweetened things, Diet Coke, Tic Tacs, et cetera. And so I found an alternative. It's by the brand Pure, Tangerine Little Mints. And they sort of remind me of the orange Tic Tacs, but 
[P81]  they don't have aspartame. So I can pop them in my mouth all day whenever I want and they never give me a stomach ache. And it's incredible because I have been on a nicotine quitting journey for a very long time now. And one of the hardest parts about quitting nicotine for me is not having something constantly in my mouth. I have a very serious oral fixation issue and I like to constantly be chewing on something 
[P82]  thing. And I've been like that since I was a kid, sucking my thumb from the time I was born to age like 12 and then vaping from age like 15, 16 and onward. I chewed gum for a while and the aspartame in the gum started to really hurt my stomach. So then I started chewing aspartame-free gum, but then I started to get really severe jaw pain. Now I'm enjoying these tangerine flavored mints. Okay. If you're somebody who can stomach aspartame, I mean, I still wouldn't recommend it because it's, 
[P83]  I think a carcinogen now. Is that true? Is aspartame a carcinogen? Let's look. The IARC, no clue who that is. Who is that? I don't know. Sounds reputable though. The IARC classifies aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans. There's limited evidence for cancer in lab animals and limited evidence related to possible 
[P84]  mechanisms for it causing cancer. Oh, okay. Interesting. But it is apparently, it looks like it's banned in Europe. I don't know. Anyway, I'm really on those now. In fact, I go through like literally a pack a day. Like I have, they come in these little tins and I literally am sucking on these all day long. They're so good. Moving on. Next.

输入内容：
[P10]  wool socks. Just a random coincidence. So there's two reasons why the men in my life love wool socks. Number one, comfort. They're just comfortable, which is shocking to me or was shocking to me because when I think of wool, I think of itchy and I'm very sensitive to itch. Like an itchy sweater, it's tough for me. Unfortunately, itchy sweaters are usually the cutest sweaters. 
[P11]  do it. Like I'm somebody, I'm very sensitive, sensorially, if that's a word. Like I'm very particular about how my clothes fit and how my clothes feel. And so if something's itchy, it's just not happening. So when the men in my life told me that wool socks are very comfortable, I was like, they're not itchy. And they're like, no. And I was like, well, I'll believe it when I feel it. The second reason why they love wool socks is because they don't stink. You can wear wool socks for two weeks 
[P12]  straight. And unless you have some of the most acidic, foul foot sweat, maybe even then you would be fine. But unless you have some sort of radioactive foot sweat, the wool socks never smell. Listen, okay? Like, I don't need to wear the same pair of socks over and over and over and over again, but would I like to? Sure. Long story short, I was convinced. Okay, wool socks seem appealing, 
[P13]  seem pretty awesome, I'll pick up a pair. So I picked up a pair of light to medium thickness wool socks. I'll describe them to you. They're a heather dark gray with some olive green and perhaps brown stripes. Now, this was the color scheme that I got because it was my favorite that was available. Wool socks, if you're unfamiliar, 
[P14]  of patterns. It's hard to find like a plain white pair of wool socks. In fact, I haven't looked that hard, but I haven't found a pair like that yet. So they tend to look pretty outdoorsy, which is sometimes the vibe, sometimes not. But I bought them anyway. And for the last few months, I've been wearing them whenever they match an outfit and whenever I can sort of wear them in a boot and they won't be seen. And I've absolutely fallen in love with wool socks. 
[P15]  found some other different types of wool socks. My favorite right now is this super thick, sort of fluffy, soft wool sock that is not quite as like skin tight, maybe a bit more fashionable looking. And I've been wearing those nonstop. I have quite a few colors now. They are not remotely itchy at all. They're not itchy at all. They're soft and squishy. They feel unbelievably comfortable on the foot and they don't stink. Like I have worn the same pair of wool socks. 
[P16]  every single day for like a week and a half straight and not felt bad about it because they never stunk and they didn't even ever look dirty. And to some people that might be disgusting. I don't care. I don't care. I mean, my feet don't really stink anyway. And so with like a normal pair of cotton socks, I'll just wear them for three days straight. I'm already somebody who pushes my socks to the limit. If I didn't have some sort of guilty conscience, I don't think I'd ever wash the wool sock because I don't think I'd have to.

[P146]  I work with eBay, which is my favorite place to do this. I found some incredible discontinued stuff on eBay. Okay. That like, I can't find anywhere else anymore because I feel like I'm at a place now where like, for the most part, when it comes to my closet, I am pretty solid with what I have. Like I don't necessarily desire new things. If I stumble upon something that's absolute magic, you know, and I just 
[P147]  have to have it. It's so me. It fits perfect. I know I'm going to get good use out of it. I'm not completely in a phase where I'm not buying anything. I'll buy it. But more than anything, I'm like, whoa, there are things in my closet that I love so much that if they discontinue this, I'm going to be really bummed out because this is something I want to be able to wear for the rest of my life. 
[P148]  I literally bought multiple pairs of these pants because they're discontinued on resale websites. Okay. I was literally scouring the internet and bought every pair I could find, which I actually found quite a few. Like I'll be good at least for the next 10 years when it comes to these pants. Now you all are going to laugh at me and I, and I'm honestly like mortified to even tell this story, but I'm going to tell it because I'm open with all of you. I know this is a brand that we 
[P149]  hate. Okay. For the most part, most of us hate this brand. Especially those of us who have watched the documentary, Brandy Melville. There used to be a pair of Brandy Melville sweatpants. They are cinched at the waist, wide leg, no cinch at the bottom. So they're straight leg, go straight all the way down. They are not fleece. They're not fuzzy. They're like just cotton, kind of heavy. They're perfect. I'm sorry. They don't make them anymore. 
[P150]  So they're gone. They don't exist anymore. You can't buy them on the website anymore. I wear these sweatpants as normal pants all the time. Listen, I'm not a fan of Brandy Melville anymore, okay? Those days are over, right? All good. However, I'm not going to lie about the fact that these are the best pants. They're my favorite pants of all time. And I wear them almost every single day. Every single day, I would say at one point, I wear those pants. 
[P151]  Sometimes in the evening time, if it's a bit cold in my house, I wear them out and run errands in them. Sometimes I style them. I will style them for a more casual outfit, but they can be pulled off as pants. I adore these pants. And when they discontinued them, it was really traumatic for me. And for the last few months, I've been frightened, like walking around every day afraid. Like, what if I stain these? What if I rip them? What happens then? 
[P152]  freaking out. And lo and behold, I dug around on the internet and I found as many pairs of them as I could. And now I have a few more of them on the way. And some of you might be thinking, Emma, that's excessive. That's stupid. No, it's not. I wear them every day. I have some favorite basic tops that are from Free People. They've had those tops for the last, can I be honest, 10 years. The exact same top for 10 years. It's not going anywhere. So I'm not loading up on that. You know what I mean? 
[P153]  it's stuff like this. That's just random, you know? And so that's what I've been doing. It's like, if something works, I think it's okay to be like, okay, I'm going to find all of them on eBay and buy all of them. You know what I'm saying? Like, I think that's actually valid and not excessive. All right, that's it. That's it. Those are some of the things I've been liking recently. There's definitely more that I'm forgetting, but that's fine because that just means I'll have more to talk about in a few months when I do this episode again. 
[P154]  I hope that you enjoyed this. And if you did, let me know somehow. I'm on social media at anything goes at Emma Chamberlain. You can find me there. If you want to hang out again, new episodes of Anything Goes every Thursday and Sunday. Stream anywhere you get podcasts and stream on YouTube. Videos on Spotify and YouTube if you want to see me. And check out my coffee company if you like coffee and want to check it out. Chamberlaincoffee.com at Chamberlain Coffee on social media. 
[P155]  I, at the beginning of this episode, Instacarted some cereal that I was craving. Wow, maybe I should give the cereal a shout out. Cinnamon Three Wishes cereal. Just sounds good to me. Need a little bowl of that. So I Instacarted that. Like, I really don't know what got into me. I like had to have it. It was very weird. Maybe I am pregnant. Like the hot dog and burger thing. And then now like I need to have this cinnamon flavored Three Wishes brand cereal. It's very random. 
[P156]  Um, anyway, but that is outside of my doorstep right now and I need to go eat that. Uh, I just need to pour up a bowl of that. So I will talk to you all later. I love you all and appreciate you all. Thank you for showing up and wanting to hang out and listen to me talk. I really appreciate it. And, um, I'll talk to you very soon. Okay. Bye.

[P96]  I would just steam some broccoli and eat it. Like broccoli was always my favorite. And recently, within the last few months, I have been virtually unable to eat broccoli. I'm slowly but surely able to eat it again, but I had a really traumatic experience. I was grooming some pre-cut broccoli because that's how particular I am about how everything is cut and cooked. I'm particular. I like things to be perfect. 
[P97]  bought pre-cut broccoli, but I decided to groom it a bit more. Because, you know, when you get it pre-cut from the store, it's like pretty well done, but it's not perfect, right? And while I was cutting it, I noticed something gray and slimy in the broccoli. And I cannot say for 100% certainty, but in my mind, I'm 100% certain, so it doesn't even matter. It was a slug, all intertwined 
[P98]  the pre-washed, pre-cut broccoli. If I had found that in broccoli that, you know, I bought from a farmer's market, it'd be a bummer. It would make me uncomfortable. It disgusts me. But there's something about the fact that if I was not the freak that I am and I didn't feel the need to clean broccoli and cut broccoli extra and get it into perfect pieces, that I wouldn't have found it and I would have potentially eaten part of a snail that was wrapped in my broccoli piece. That made me, that just traumatized me. 
[P99]  It has completely traumatized me. And what's even worse is I tried to cut it off. I don't like wasting food, okay? So I tried to cut off what I thought was the piece where the snail was in and I just threw it away. And I proceeded to steam the broccoli. I took the broccoli out of the steamer and as I'm pouring it out into a bowl, I noticed the piece that the slug was in. And you might be asking, Emma, how do you know which one it was? Because there was more slug that had now steamed 
[P100]  expanded into... I can't. I can't. I can't. I am already a bit of a picky eater. I'm a bit particular about food. This occurrence has completely put me off broccoli. It's heartbreaking because it's my favorite. But I was so disgusted by this. And what's impressive is I actually picked out that piece that had the little slug on it or whatever, threw it out, and I proceeded to eat the rest of the broccoli really carefully. 
[P101]  looking at the rest of the pieces, but this has traumatized me and scarred me so deeply that I've really had a hard time eating vegetables since. Like I'm just afraid of something hiding inside of my vegetable. I'm just, I'm disgusted. This sort of happened to me a while ago with raspberries too, where I found like a little caterpillar inside of a raspberry. And ever since then, I cannot eat raspberries without looking inside of every single one, right? This is just who I am. Okay. I don't, I don't, 
[P102]  like eating bugs and I get grossed out easily and then I just can't eat something for like months and months. But I know the importance of eating vegetables and I feel good when I eat vegetables and I actually enjoy vegetables. But because I'm so put off by them right now, I've had to get creative. And it's actually hilarious because I almost feel like I'm my own mother. You know, when like moms will sneak vegetables into their kids' foods, their kids will eat vegetables by like blending it up into something or like putting it in 
[P103]  and mixing it up with sauce so that you can barely see that there's vegetables in there. Like, you know what I mean? That's literally what I have to do with myself these days. And so recently, my favorite go-to vegetable to just add to anything I can to get vegetables in is peas and carrots. Yep, peas and carrots. I will put steamed peas and carrots into anything. My favorite is if I'm making a pasta dish, a little bit of peas, a little bit of carrots, add it in. Honestly, delicious. By the way, like genuinely delicious. 
[P104]  but it's just, it's like, it's so fucked up. I hate getting food aversions like this, but I'm slowly but surely getting back to being able to eat other vegetables too. But in the meantime, like peas and carrots have been saving my life and I literally add them to everything, okay? Like another example would be, I like to make little egg bites. Like, you know how Starbucks has the little egg bites? Well, I like to make those too, okay? And I used to add broccoli into my egg bites, 
[P105]  No, I can't anymore. So you know what I started adding? Sounds weird, but peas and carrots. And it actually is quite good. I'm just adding it into anything that I would normally add broccoli into. And it's tasty and it's doing the trick. Next, I don't know if I've talked about this before and that's why I'm talking about it now. Period underwear. Okay, I'm talking about underwear with a built-in pad. I cannot express how much this has changed my life. I would say my favorite brand is the brand,

[P5]  let's start with something super weird. Recently, I have been absolutely loving burgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, basically American meats in between American types of bread. And I know what you're thinking. Emma, aren't you a vegetarian? Yes, I am. Okay. Thankfully, 
[P6]  Food technology has gotten to a point now where you can be vegetarian and still feel like you're eating meat, okay? Fake burger, fake hot dog, it feels real enough to me, okay? I don't know what's going on because I've never really been obsessed with burgers or hot dogs or corn dogs. This has never been a favorite food of mine. I've never cared about this genre of food. But for some reason recently, 
[P7]  This is my favorite food. This is all I'm craving. This is all I want. Okay. I want to eat a beautiful, beautiful veggie burger on a yummy, yummy bun. And I want it to have a bunch of mustard and I want it to have a bunch of ketchup and I want it to have little dill pickle spheres on my burger. I want to sink my teeth into it. That's what sounds good to me. 
[P8]  and all the mustard on it. And I want to absolutely eat it. If I could have anything right now, it'd be a corn dog. You know what I'm saying? This is my favorite food right now. And it makes no sense. I don't know where it came from. It's so random and it's so out of the blue that it makes me think I'm pregnant. And I'm not. I don't, I mean, no, I'm not. I'm actually not because I'm on my period. You know, every month you never know. Okay. Anything's possible. I am not pregnant because I'm fully on my period right now. So 
[P9]  All good. I just, like, I've never felt more American in my life. Anyway, this is just, it's just so weird, but I am absolutely loving, loving, loving American meat and bread combos. Okay, moving on to something a little bit less random and a little bit more rational, perhaps. Wool socks. Okay, I was fully influenced by the men in my life.

[P1] ﻿ Every few months, I get sort of a craving, a craving to just sit down and discuss some of the stuff that I like. I think I get this craving every few months because I'm constantly evolving, okay? My routine is constantly changing. My opinions are constantly changing. One day, I absolutely love something. I'm obsessed with it. And the next day, I couldn't care less about it. This is just who I am, a constantly evolving person. 
[P2]  I'm just inconsistent. It's not really a positive thing. I disagree. I think this personality trait of mine makes me interesting. The fact that every few months I have a brand new list of things that I really like, I think that makes me interesting. Without further ado, let me share this list with you. This list of things that have truly brought me joy over the last few months. 
[P3]  Tomorrow, I might not care about these things anymore, but we can't worry about tomorrow. No, we can't. All we have is today. Yeah, all we have is the present. And today, this list is relevant. It's powerful. This list is everything. Let's begin. I briefly paused this episode of Anything Goes to let you know that this episode of Anything Goes is presented by Amazon. Getting sick is horrible enough. 
[P4]  The getting better part shouldn't be horrible too. Waiting on hold for an appointment, sitting in crowded waiting rooms, standing in line at the pharmacy, that's almost as bad as the sickness itself. Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy remove these painful parts of getting better with things like 24-7 virtual visits and prescriptions delivered to your door. Thanks to Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy for sponsoring today's episode. Now let's get back to the episode. Um, okay.

[P73]  watch. I've been wearing a digital watch for the last few months. And I sort of told this story in my 2025 fashion trend predictions when I predicted the digital watch. I was kind of anti the digital watch at first, right? I sort of discovered it because somebody in my life wears a digital watch. And at first, I was sort of repulsed by their digital watch. I was like, this is absolutely hideous and weird. And I wasn't hateful towards it on that person, right? But being somebody 
[P74]  loves clothing and fashion and accessories in all capacities. Every time I look at something, I'm thinking about whether or not I would wear it, you know? And so this person in my life was wearing a digital watch. And when I first saw it very, very quietly in my own head, in brain, I looked at the watch and said, that's the most hideous thing I've ever seen because I'm a human being and I can't control my thoughts. Okay. And if I see something and think it's absolutely hideous and weird, I will think that. I will not tell the person because I'm polite. 
[P75]  But I will think it. And I did. And then I came around. Eventually, I was like, you know what, though? I do like the idea of a digital watch because I can't easily read an analog clock. I hate setting an analog watch. It's so annoying. And it's never like perfectly exact. You know, it actually sounds like a genuinely useful thing to wear. And so I found one that I liked that was smaller and dainty. It's like just a rubber, you know, little Casio black watch with like a little blue border. 
[P76]  around. Um, yeah, I don't even know. And I put it on. And at first I was like, I don't like it. It's uncomfortable. And the person in my life who wears the watch was like, just keep wearing it and it'll get comfortable. And I was like, okay. So I wore it for like a week. I haven't taken it off since. And actually, do you know what? That's not true. I did take it off for one day and multiple times throughout the day, I went to go look at the time on my watch and I didn't have a watch on and I freaked out. 
[P77]  me 24 seven. I never take this little $20 watch off. It's unbelievable to me how much I absolutely adore this watch. And it's $20. I say that because majority of watches are very expensive and for, you know, somewhat valid reason. Um, a lot of watches are really masterfully made and very, you know, they're little pieces of art and I respect the art of the watch, but these watches are like, you know, tens of hundreds of thousands of 
[P78]  And so it's just funny to me that my favorite watch I've ever owned and the watch I've worn the most in my entire life is a $20 Casio watch. And I'm not saying that to like be like, oh my God, look at me with the 20. I'm just saying it's just, it's genuinely one of the best watches I've ever had. It's the most comfortable. It's the most durable. I'm not worried about it. I'm not worried about damaging it because if it gets damaged, I'll buy a new one because it's $20. It doesn't matter. It's not like, oh my God, I need to go get it fixed. 
[P79]  like whatever, because, you know, it's a $40,000 watch. It's like, it's no biggie. If I can fix it, I can fix it. And if not, no stress. There's no stress around it. You know, I like the way it looks now too. Like I actually think it looks cool. I'm so into it. Love a digital watch. Next, I have really been obsessed with orange flavored mints for a long time. I really loved orange Tic Tacs. However, I am very picky about artificial

[P128]  and they've been overhyped. It's like, oh my God, how good can a cup really be? I don't care what anyone says. I love my Stanley Cup. I don't care if they're overrated. I don't care. I love my Stanley Cups. I love that I have three of them. I love them as a group of three and I love my Stanley Cup. I love each one individually, okay? I have a cream one. I have a dark blue one and I have a weird sort of ugly rose gold looking one, okay? And pretty much at all times, the blue and the cream are in 
[P129]  rotation. And in one, I have sparkling water and apple cider vinegar. Don't worry. I did extensive research about whether or not it's safe to put vinegar in a Stanley cup. It is. Okay. So don't get on me. I did hours of research on that. So that's in one Stanley cup. And then in the other Stanley cup, I have electrolytes because I do so much hot yoga these days. Okay. And then that last third Stanley cup, I know what you're thinking. 
[P130]  Emma, you don't even use that thing. You absolute consumerist pig. What are you doing with that third Stanley Cup? Shut the fuck up. Shut up. Okay? I have people that come over, friends, family, loved ones, and I like to fill up a Stanley Cup for them. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. If somebody is hanging out at my house for an extended period of time, they get to have a Stanley Cup. Do they want to bring it home? Do they want to borrow it? They can. It's no problem. 
[P131]  in the dishwasher because I routinely clean my Stanley cups because I'm not disgusting. I can whip out the ugly sort of rose gold looking one and use that one. I don't know why I bought that one. It's a hideous color. I absolutely hate it, but it doesn't matter because it does the trick. I love the Stanley cup. I'm fucking sick of people ruining a good thing. Stop ruining the reputation of a good thing. That's what we do with everything good in society. In fact, I could make a whole episode about all the things that we've ruined 
[P132]  like ruining the culture around something. Like we've ruined the culture around the Stanley Cup, but I'm here to try my best to bring it back. So I have three more, but the last three, I'm putting a fucking disclaimer before it, okay? Because these last three things are genuinely things that I've been loving recently. However, they relate in one way or another to a brand that I work with actively right now. They did not tell me, hey, Emma, can you mention us in your podcast? 
[P133]  No, this is not in the contract. This is not a part of the deal that we've sorted out, okay? This is just me genuinely talking about these things. However, I am mentioning that I'm affiliated with the brand, even though I technically don't have to because they're not sponsoring me to say these words. And trust me, I'm not trying to get into a lawsuit, so you're never going to see me not disclosing my advertisements, okay? I'm very, very particular about that. But I have to say that I like these things because I genuinely do,

[P67]  water. At a certain point when you're consuming that much of something, you're like, this feels wasteful. I need to figure out an alternative to small little sparkling water cans because I'm going through a case of cans a week. Like this just feels wasteful. And so I finally decided that I would get a water carbonator. Okay. And it took weeks to figure out which one to get. I found this one that was really aesthetically beautiful. 
[P68]  And I was like, oh, maybe I'll get this one. But then I read the reviews and the reviews were sort of iffy. So then I found this other one that like was super automatic. You put water in it and like in a tank in the back of the little machine. And then you just press a button and it just spits out carbonated water. But then I read reviews on that one and it was like, this one's really messy. Like, you know, maybe wouldn't recommend. And then, you know, there's of course like the SodaStream, the classic where it's like a plastic sort of cheap. 
[P69]  looking kind of bottle that you attach to the thing and then you carbonate. And that one had pretty good reviews, but then there was another brand that was maybe a bit fancier than the SodaStream and that one had really good reviews. And so that's the one I decided on. It took me so long to pick the right one. I got the brand Drinkmate, okay? Drinkmate water carbonator. It's not super fancy. Like I'm somebody who will spend a little bit more money if something looks aesthetically pleasing, 
[P70]  reviews from like a actual carbonating the drink standpoint. And I bought it and I'm absolutely loving it. One of my favorite things about it is that you don't have to plug it into power. It's powered by a CO2 tank. So like I can store it inside of a cabinet and then just pull it out whenever I want to use it. And I don't have to plug it in or anything. It's so easy. It takes five seconds to carbonate. It's so, it's incredible. And now I'm sort of living the DIY life. 
[P71]  with two products that I constantly used to rebuy, nut milk, because I have a nut milk maker from the brand Almond Cow. And now I have this water carbonator from Drinkmate. It's like, just being able to make stuff, you know, on your own, I think is so fun, but also like convenient because you never fully run out. Like I can make nut milk whenever I want because I always have the raw ingredients. You know what I'm saying? I can make sparkling water whenever I want. 
[P72]  I have extras if it runs out, worst case scenario. And I always have plain water. You know what I'm saying? Anyway, I actually mentioned this in my 2025 ins and outs. I was like, I think making stuff yourself is in. Anyway, and my water carbonator is just unbelievable. Moving on to another thing that I've already talked about. In my 2025 fashion trend predictions, I mentioned digital watches being in. I'm so into the digital

When I make myself a beautiful hot latte, I don't want to pour that into like a diner mug and not be able to see the beautiful layers of foam on the top and like the swirly milk in the bottom. Like I want to see that shit. And that's why I love a clear glass mug. Now the reason why this is in the portion of the episode that is not sponsored but is affiliated 
[P143]  with brands that I am affiliated with is because my brand, Chamberlain Coffee, does sell clear glass mugs. However, if you don't like my brand, don't worry. They sell them in other places as well, okay? So you can find them elsewhere if you don't want the Chamberlain Coffee logo on it because you hate me. That's totally fine. It's my favorite mug. And I have other mugs that I absolutely love. I have some nostalgic mugs that I've had for many years. 
[P144]  I have a mug that I bought from my favorite hotel in Paris. I have a mug with like characters, you know, like Moomin. It's like Moominland, you know, like the little Moomins. It's like a little cartoon, whatever. Okay. I used to love those books when I was a kid. I have all these mugs that I really like that have personal sentimental value to me. And yet nothing brings more joy to me than drinking my beautiful latte out of a clear mug. 
[P145]  I want to see what's happening. I want to see how much I have left. I want to see the foam on the top. I want to see everything. I just feel that way with my coffee in general. I need to see it. And then last but not least, I have been really loving going online and finding things that I love that are discontinued. Scouring the internet. Scouring resale websites.

[P47]  week. And then slowly I started going a little bit more and a little bit more. And now it's something that I do like four or five days a week because I love it so much. It's definitely one of the hardest workouts I've ever done, which is interesting because, you know, in theory, it's like we're not lifting heavy weights. You know, we're not doing like 30 minutes of cardio. 
[P48]  You know, at least a third of the class is spent doing pretty subtle, gentle actions, but it is so hard. I mean, the heat itself is really uncomfortable, right? But the small sort of movements and the gentle movements when repeated over and over again, like that shit hurts. And there's something about sweating to that extent 
[P49]  of workout that just for some reason works really well for my body. Like I feel really good afterward. Um, but I actually enjoy the workout too. Like the workout's really hard and it's really uncomfortable, but it's a type of hard and uncomfortable that for some reason for me, psychologically, I like, I, for many years did a lot of like bootcamp classes, which was like running and weights. And that was sort of my go-to workout class for many years. 
[P50]  I liked it. And I still like it. Sometimes I'll still go to those classes sometimes if my body is craving it for some reason. But I found that I got really sick of that after a few months. And, you know, I kept doing it because it made me feel good. But it was like it lost its excitement. There's something about hot yoga that just like never gets old to me. But also I think the emphasis on sweating and stretching also make it something that over time are making me feel better. 
[P51]  better and like healthier, which I'm not like claiming any health benefits for, you know, going to hot yoga. In fact, I actually did a lot of research when I started going a lot on whether or not it's even healthy to go four or five days a week because I was sort of concerned. And I did see some things that were like, it can potentially, you know, be detrimental to your electrolyte balance in your body because, you know, you're sweating a lot. And so I supplement on days that I go to hot yoga and I supplement with very like 
[P52]  fast-absorbing, well-rounded electrolytes, which helps a lot. And I drink a lot of water. And I just am intuitive with my body. If something's filling off, I'm like, all right, I need to either be drinking more water, supplementing with more electrolytes or whatever. But I don't know. I've been fine. And I felt really good. The constant sweating, I'm not going to claim that it's detoxifying me because I've heard a lot of pushback from scientists around what 
[P53]  detox even means and like that the word detox is like abused in the wellness space, you know, because our bodies are constantly detoxing. Like we don't need to go sweat to detox. Like that's not how it works. I've heard doctors and stuff talking about that. So I won't say that I'm detoxing, but I do feel refreshed from sweating on almost a daily basis. Like it just makes me feel physically good. I don't know why. I also think 
[P54]  yoga is becoming trendy. Like I I'm predicting that I've talked about that before. Like I think it's going to become sort of the trendy workout of the year and I'm there, I'm there and I'm into it too. So I'm fully like into it. Like it's a cult for me, but I have a tendency to join the sort of workout class cult. Like many years ago I was in the cycling class cult and then I was in the bootcamp class cult. I never really got into like reformer Pilates or anything. I never really 
[P55]  it very much. I tried and I got kind of into it for a few months, but like, just doesn't work for me. But this is, this is working for me and I'm loving it. Okay. Moving on. The TV show Squid Game. Now I know what you're thinking, Emma, you're probably talking about season two because season two just came out. No, I'm talking about season one.

Anytime I've ever seen this game being played, it's with people over the age of 60. I'm now realizing it's not because it's a game that is nostalgic to a certain generation and, you know, it isn't really fun anymore. There's much better games to play and it's sort of, you know, lost its allure for 
[P36]  newer generations, but it's not something that only that generation can enjoy, okay? I thought that that was the case. I thought it was like, oh, well, this is probably a nostalgic game that these people grew up playing. But its value is mainly coming from nostalgia for these people. I was so wrong. I was so wrong. We're all judging the game Yahtzee, okay? Yahtzee is an incredible game. Over the holidays, my family and I were obsessed 
[P37]  with Yahtzee. In fact, I'm talking about it right now and I'm like, oh my God, I just want to play Yahtzee. I love it. Okay. Basically how you play is like you put five dice in a, in a cup and you shake it and you throw it on the table and you're basically trying to roll different combinations. Like for example, three of a kind or four of a kind, which would be like three dice with the same number or four dice with the same number, uh, or like, uh, 
[P38]  a straight, which is like one, two, three, four, five, six, right? You know what I'm saying? So like you're trying to roll these different combinations and you have a little piece of paper that has all the different combinations listed and you're trying to roll as many of them as you can. And for each turn, you get to roll three times. So you roll once and then you can like pick up, let's say two out of the five dice and re-roll those two. And you're trying to get a combination that you like and you get three tries per turn 
[P39]  do so. And it's just absolutely so fun. And it sounds stupid, but it's so fun. I'm obsessed with it. In order to roll a Yahtzee, which is one of the combinations that you can roll, you want to get five of a kind. So like you want the dice to be all fives or all sixes or all ones. The feeling when you get a fucking Yahtzee is, it's like an orgasm. Okay. Have you ever had an orgasm? Okay. That's what it feels like to roll a Yahtzee. So if you want to have an 
[P40]  outside of the bedroom, go ahead and get the game Yahtzee and start playing that with your loved ones because it feels really good. You can even play it alone. It's not as fun, but you could, which is also a unique trait of the game. Anyway, you need to be playing Yahtzee. We all do. Moving on to the next game, Clue. I absolutely loved Clue as a kid, but I used to play games with my dad. My dad and I loved games. We loved board games, card games. 
[P41]  everything. And I was an only child of divorced parents. So when I was at my dad's house and we were playing games, it was just the two of us. And I always wanted to play Clue, but Clue requires three people minimum. And so over the holidays, there were lots of people around and I was able to play Clue. And wow, I really fell in love with Clue. 
[P42]  Clue is basically a board game where it's like a murder board game. Basically, there's all these cards with a bunch of different characters, a bunch of different weapons, a bunch of different rooms. And you separate them all into their own piles of people, weapons, and rooms. And then without looking, you take one person, one weapon, one room, and put it into this little folder and put it in the center of the board and hand out the rest of the cards to the players. 
[P43]  And then the cards in the center of the board become the murder, the murder weapon in the murder room where everything happened, right? And then everybody takes turns moving around the board and going into a room and then guessing like who they think did it and with what weapon in that room. This is, I don't know why I'm explaining the rules. Long story short, you're trying to figure out what's in the center of the board using process of elimination by asking people like, 
[P44]  basically trying to figure out what cards they have through making suggestions. And then if they do have the card, oh, I'm not explaining this anymore, but you get the idea. If you don't know how to play Clue, it's not that fucking hard, okay? But it's so much fun. Don't rely on me for the instructions, okay? Read the instructions in the box. But I'm absolutely loving Clue. It's so exhilarating. It's so exciting. It's really challenging psychologically. 
[P45]  constantly behind and like constantly overwhelmed by all the potential options. And the more you play, the better you get at strategy. And you start to figure out more and more complex ways to analyze the game that's happening and like figure out what the other players are doing. And you get better at analyzing their behavior and using it as evidence for yourself. It's like insane. And the more you play, the more insane it gets. And it's just so much fun. I really do love physical games. 
[P46]  think everybody needs to go to their local store that sells board games and pick up a few because they've definitely gone out of style, but I think it's time that they have a comeback. Okay, next. Moving on. Hot yoga. Obsessed. Hot yoga and hot Pilates. Yeah. For many years, I was going to a hot yoga, hot Pilates class once a

[P111]  but they are a bit boring. And I was recently in the market for some silver charms or white gold charms because I've noticed over the past year and a half since switching over to white gold slash silver jewelry and having that be sort of my go-to medal, that there are way less cute options in white gold and silver, in my opinion, than there are in gold. I feel like the gold designs are often, 
[P112]  like more timeless, more dainty, more everyday. Whereas white gold or silver jewelry is either really, really plain or like e-girl vibes or like e-boy vibes. Do we remember e-girl, e-boy? Okay, I'm talking about like a little angel or like a little cross or it's like very like almost gothic. Like that's a lot of the stuff that you find online. And I was like, this is not what I want. Like I want the same sort of jewelry designs 
[P113]  but I just want them in white gold or silver and I'm not finding it. So I sort of came to the conclusion that I was going to have to kind of do my own jewelry designing to find what I wanted because I wasn't finding what I wanted. So I decided like, I'm going to look online for some, you know, really cool, like white gold, silver charms that I could then, you know, attach to earrings or wear on a charm necklace or like attached to things so that I could take, you know, the simple, basic white gold, silver pieces, 
[P114]  that I'm finding and then spice them up with my own additions, right? Because I'm not finding stuff that has it all in one. So I found this website that was selling like every type of charm you could potentially imagine in white, gold, and silver. They had white, gold, and silver in all of them. And I was like, this is so fun. So I ordered a bunch in various like symbols that sort of have some sort of personal connection to my life in one way or another. I wasn't sure if it was going to work or if it was going to look good, but I was like, 
[P115]  try. I wanted to put it onto my huggy earrings, like the little small huggies. It's so cute and unique. And it did exactly what I wanted it to do. And so, I don't know, if you have some charms hanging around, potentially attach them to your hoop earrings and create like a brand new earring out of it. Or if you're a white gold silver wearer and you're feeling like, wow, I am not finding things I like, this could potentially be a method for you. 
[P116]  still in the market for a really good white gold silver chain. I've ordered a few and I've hated all of them. So I don't know. Okay. Next, wearing this same outfit over and over and over again for like three weeks straight until I'm sick of it. I've had multiple outfits like this where I've just gotten into the routine of wearing the outfit literally over and over and over again for like three weeks.

主题：步行习惯的养成与益处

输入内容：
[P17]  I absolutely love a wool sock. Okay, moving on to walking. Randomly on the first day of this year, I decided that this year I was going to hit 10,000 steps a day. And I'm a little bit late to that trend, but at the same time, I don't think walking 10,000 steps a day is a trend. I actually think it's just sort of a lifestyle choice. Like I'm going to make sure I move this much per day, right? 
[P18]  I never tried it prior because for many years I was into running. And so I was less focused on how many steps I got a day and I was more focused on how far I would run per session of running, right? So on a day that I wasn't running, I didn't pay attention to how much I was walking at all because I had run the day before. And so I was just sort of measuring my cardiovascular exercise different. But this sort of new, 
[P19]  goal of 10K steps a day has sort of shifted my focus from running more onto walking. And I've grown to prefer walking because I never really loved running, right? I loved the way I felt after I ran, you know, all the endorphins and stuff. But when I was actually running, I never really liked it. On a good day, it would be sort of meditative, but that's like on a good day. And for the most part, it was just fucking miserable. And I was really just pushing through because I knew at the end of it, 
[P20]  feel really good. And because it's sort of good for you. It's like, sometimes you need to eat your vegetables because you know it'll help your digestion, right? And it doesn't taste good, but it's like, I know this is good for me. There are times in life when we must do things that are for the sake of our health, even if they're not the most enjoyable, and that's fine. But walking, I'm into it. I'm so late, but I'm so into it. 
[P21]  Like, you know, a year and a half, two years, maybe even three years ago, it was so trendy to go on the hot girl walk. And now I'm like, oh, well, I mean, I got it back then, but like, I'm really, it's really clicking for me now. I've always liked walking, you know, but like now that it's a goal for me every day to hit 10K steps, I'm appreciating the routine of walking in a whole new way because I'm walking more than I ever have. You know, I live in Los Angeles. 
[P22]  Okay. It's not easy to walk. We're not invited to walk in the city. It's a driving city. You have to make an effort to walk. When I visit, you know, Paris or New York, I walk all the time. I easily hit 10,000 steps a day in Los Angeles. That doesn't happen. So like I've been constantly thinking about, okay, how can I hit my 10,000 step goal? And I've found all of these delightful ways to sort of get my steps in. 
[P23]  after dinner, going on a nightly walk. I did that a lot growing up with my dad because my dad goes on a nightly walk after dinner almost every night. And so I always did that with him growing up and I still do that with him when I go and visit or when we're like on a trip together, we'll always go on a nightly walk. Whenever I'm with him, I do that. But when I'm alone, I don't do that. And now I'm doing that and I'm absolutely loving it. And it's starting to become a part of my Los Angeles routine. 
[P24]  I'm taking the stairs more often. Now that I'm trying to hit a number, every time I see the stairs, I'm like, okay, this could help me get my numbers up. Let's take the stairs. And I break a little sweat and it feels really good. And I'm starting to notice like, wow, I'm really getting good at climbing the stairs. I have a treadmill at home and I've sort of gotten into a little mini routine of working on my little iPad while on the treadmill. I like set it up on the little platform and I walk, 
[P25]  And I work and it's incredible. I used to think that I had to run and like running needed to be a part of my workout routine in order for me to release endorphins and feel good. But making it a goal to, you know, walk as much as possible has actually ended up having equally as beneficial of a feeling for me. And I'm loving it even more. 
[P26]  more than running. I'm all about walking. I know I'm late, but I love it. So I had to talk about it. Moving on to retinol. What is retinol? I'm going to read the definition online because I don't want to mess it up. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that's used in skincare products and as a dietary supplement. It's used to treat acne, wrinkles, and other signs of aging. Retinol increases collagen production, which can help skin look firmer and plumper.

[P106]  NYX, K-N-I-X, I can really like bleed in these underwear, okay? And I'm good. And you know, if I want to be super powerful and I really don't want to have to like wear a tampon or anything because I am kind of off tampons recently, like I'm really avoiding them. I'll put like a pad and then wear the period underwear. There's no bleeding through. There's no way. It's impossible. 
[P107]  I just think period underwear are absolutely incredible. It's a genius invention. And I'm on my period right now. I'm wearing the period underwear right now. And like, I just feel safe. I feel comfortable. I feel like everything's going to be okay. I feel like I'm not going to leak on my pants. I'm not frightened. I'm not scared. I feel contained. And I'm really off tampons right now. I just, the whole concept of them, like they're necessary sometimes, but I think I just read too much about them online. 
[P108]  to the point where it started to make me paranoid about them and like not feel like they're the best option. And so I just, I'm like loving the period underwear because that in a pad together, I just, I feel like I don't even need to wear a tampon. And that's a good feeling because I don't want to wear a tampon. Obviously, sometimes I still, well, actually, I recently bought like one of the little cups, you know, because for really heavy periods, you know, sometimes you need more than a cup in a period underwear. Sometimes it's 
[P109]  really heavy. I bought one of those cups, but my period has been pretty light the last few months, so I haven't needed it. But I do have the cup ready because I'm just off the tampon. I think everybody needs some good pairs of period underwear. My favorite though are the shorts. They sell like little period underwear boy shorts. They're so fucking comfortable. I would just wear them on a normal day when I'm not even on my period just because they're comfortable. Okay, moving on. Adding little charms to my earrings. Everyone's talking about charm necklaces. What about charm 
[P110]  earrings. Okay. My favorite type of earring to wear is a huggy, like a little small hoop in all my, you know, miscellaneous piercings. In my main hole, I like to wear a hoop, like a big hoop, right? That's my go-to. It has been for the last probably four years. But in the other holes, I like to wear little huggies, little tight to the ear, small hoops. Huggies are cute and huggies are fun.

[P85]  I love cooking shows. I love cooking YouTube channels. I love cooking everything. I love looking through cookbooks. I love going to the grocery store. I love, I love, love, love food. And I honestly sometimes wonder if I'm a super taster, which is like, apparently there's a certain like genetic trait that is being a super taster or like a super smeller where you can taste and smell flavors that most people can't pick up on because they're so vague. 
[P86]  Sometimes I think I have that because I literally will take a bite of something and be like, that has rosemary in it. And they're like, how did you even know that? There's like one tablespoon of rosemary oil in that. And I'm like, I don't know. I just know. I could also just be sort of educated on food in that way more than the average person. But anyway, I go through phases where I cook and I'm so back. I'm so back. I was really off of it for a while. And recently I just finally got back into it. 
[P87]  loving is finding recipes in cookbooks, which I haven't really done before, to be honest. I feel like majority of the recipes before now have been like either random recipes that I've come up with on my own or like random recipes I've found in YouTube videos or random recipes I've found on Pinterest. That's honestly how I used to find majority of my recipes on Pinterest. 
[P88]  really enjoying about the cookbook is the fact that these recipes are like good enough to be published in the book. Do you know what I'm saying? Like if something's being published in a book, it's probably pretty fucking good. You know, whereas the internet is the wild, wild west. Okay. I can't tell you how many times I've copied a recipe online and it's been all right, but like not the best. There's just so many options online. Like if you Google homemade falafel recipe, 
[P89]  want to make homemade falafel and hummus. Do you know how many different falafel recipes there are on the internet? I don't know, probably 40,000. Okay. How are you supposed to narrow it down? I mean, and sometimes they have reviews and stuff, but like, I don't know, there's just something really reassuring about the fact that a recipe is in a book. Like I just trust it. And I've had really good experiences thus far. I mean, I've only cooked a few recipes from a cookbook, but enough to know that I'm really into this sort of method. 
[P90]  think it's kind of fun to collect cookbooks. Like you can refer to, you know, recipes again that way. I personally love having physical books around that I can just pick up when I'm bored. So I'm into it. And if anyone wants to get me a gift, get me a vegetarian cookbook. Actually, I guess a pescatarian cookbook because I cook fish for people sometimes and for myself, but I still sort of consider myself to be a vegetarian. 
[P91]  because I don't think I eat fish enough. I don't know. It's really confusing for me. We don't need to use labels. Okay, moving on. Speaking of cooking, having a really fancy cooking knife is kind of a game changer. I've watched a lot of cooking shows and a lot of cooking YouTube, and I've seen a lot of chefs talk about the importance of having a go-to knife. And randomly, a company actually sent me, I wish I could remember who, I literally can't,

Um, although they probably will love me for this and I love you guys back. Although one of these brands is my own brand. Um, but so let's begin with, uh, with those, with this portion of the favorites. Okay. Number one, we have the black Adidas. 
[P135]  Taekwondo sneaker. These are very trendy right now. These became very trendy last year. A lot of fashion influencers were wearing these shoes. If you don't know what the Adidas Taekwondo looks like, it's like, honestly, it sort of looks like a Samba, but it has no laces. It just has like a flat top, but it doesn't fully look like a Samba.

[P136]  flip on. I love that it's an all black, simple, smooth shoe, but there's a little pop of white. So it like makes it a little bit more dynamic. I'm really into it. And, you know, they are really popular and they're very like trendy right now, which can sometimes like when it comes to a sneaker, it can be tough because it's like, wow, does everyone have the sneaker? But I don't care with this one because I genuinely love how it looks. And I feel like it's just weird and futuristic looking enough to, 
[P137]  not just feel like a sneaker. Like it feels interesting. It feels elevated. And I feel like I can wear them with a more elevated outfit, like a black skirt or like, you know, a sweater. And it doesn't feel choogy. Like sometimes when you're wearing like a fancy, nice outfit with a sneaker, it can feel choogy because it can feel like this outfit would look better with a loafer. This outfit would look better with a little ballet flat or something. This shoe to me feels elevated to a point where I can wear it with 
[P138]  more elevated outfit and it fits. It like feels right. I just, I love it. I really think it's a good shoe. That leads me to my honorable mention Adidas shoe, which is the Adidas Tokyo. I, again, I'm telling you, they're not paying me to say this. I just genuinely really am enjoying these shoes. The Adidas Tokyo is an incredible shoe. It's like a very slim retrofit. Again, very on trend, 
[P139]  for right now, undeniably on trend for right now. You know, this sort of retro slim sneaker in sort of retro colors. The colors I have right now, I have, you know, the like creamish bases with, there's a pair with red stripes, blue stripes, and green. I have all three because I work with the brand. So I have the shoe. I love them. I really love them. I do. I just, they're really comfortable. And to me, 
[P140]  classic. To me, they're classic and they're timeless. I really do believe that they're timeless because they're so simple. And I think that they're great. Anyway, those are my favorite sneakers right now. I'm kind of in a sneaker phase as of the last few weeks. I was really into a flat, like a flat phase, like I was wearing a lot of flats. But for whatever reason, for the last few weeks, I've been really drawn to a sneaker. And that's why I'm mentioning it now. Okay, moving on to clear glass 
[P141]  coffee mugs. It's the wintertime. And you know what that means? Emma's drinking a hot coffee in the morning, which is a new thing as of the last few years, because I used to only drink ice drinks, even if it was two degrees outside. But as I've gotten older, I've enjoyed a hot drink a bit more. And it started as something that during the wintertime I'd order at a cafe, but never make for myself at home. Now, I absolutely love making myself hot

[P56]  I weirdly refuse to consume a piece of media when it's popular. It's very hard for me when something first comes out and it's hyped up and everybody's talking about it. It's hard for me to motivate to consume that media because I feel like everyone's talking about it. My opinion on it is going to be swayed and confused because everybody else seems to like it. It's just I weirdly become disinterested in something if everybody's talking about it and everything. 
[P57]  and everybody likes it. And that's not me trying to be, like, a fucking pick-me. Like, well, I only, like, listen to, like, an album that, like, one person listened to. Or, like, I'm only watching movies that are, like, indie that nobody, it's not even that. It's just that, like, I don't even really like TV and movies to begin with. Like, I've always preferred, like, documentary, YouTube, stuff like that. Like, that's always been my preferred entertainment source. So unless something sounds, like, genuinely interesting to me as a person, 
[P58]  I'm not just going to watch something because it's popular. However, the irony of that is that usually things are popular for a reason. And so when I eventually come around and watch them, I really like them. That's exactly what's happening right now with Squid Game. I finally got around to watching it, honestly, because someone in my life was like, can we fucking watch this so that we can watch season two and you know what's going on? And I was like, I guess. So I started watching this, not even because I wanted to, but rather, 
[P59]  to bond with a loved one. Okay. And it's such a good show. It's fucking insane. It's an insane show. You know, I don't watch a lot of TV. Um, I'm not like a TV junkie, so I can't really speak to like shows like this in this category. I haven't seen a lot of shows like this. Like this is a very sort of action, drama, thriller, crime, like everything sort of story. And it's very action packed and it's 
[P60]  very, there's a lot of stuff going on at once, right? And I could be totally wrong about this and I just haven't seen enough TV, but I feel like Squid Game is truly one of the most dynamic shows I've ever watched in my entire life. Like the amount of storylines that the writers have going at once in season one is unbelievable. It's mastery. Like the fact that like 
[P61]  Seamlessly in a way that's easy to follow, there's like 15 storylines going on in one TV show and it all flows perfectly. And the timeline of it all makes sense. And like, it's just incredibly done. And again, I don't know if this is like the standard, like the industry standard and like all action drama, you know, dramatic, crazy sort of shows. Like this is how they're structured. They have like 15 storylines going at once and they all seamlessly work together. 
[P62]  of this genre of television of like action and stuff. But I just, it's really crazy. And the actual story itself is so interesting and smart and dystopian. I just, it's such a good show. And I know I'm so late, but I'm just here like three, four years later to say, I finally watched Squid Game and I totally get it. You guys, I'm here and I totally get it. It's making me like get into TV. Like now I'm like, 
[P63]  what series am I going to watch next? Because now I'm in this routine of watching one episode every night before bed, which is sort of horrible because the show is very intense and scary and it kind of is making me anxious every night, but all good. But yeah, now I'm kind of in the routine of watching TV, which I don't think is bad because I do appreciate the art form of television and movies and stuff. And I always have wished that I was more into it, 
[P64]  always been more interested in YouTube and documentary and stuff. So like fictional TV and movies, it's just never really been my thing, but I've always wanted it to be my thing because I really do appreciate the art of it. I just like have so often been disappointed by it or like been afraid of the commitment of sitting down for a two hour movie or starting, you know, a 12 episode series that it's sort of prevented me from getting into it. Also to the fact that it's fictional, it's not real. 
[P65]  I'm not learning anything from it that's like factual, right? If anything, I'm learning something through metaphor, through like theme or whatever, which is valuable, but it's less promised that I'm going to learn something, which to me, I'm like, who is that a waste of time? I've always had issues with fictional television and fictional movies, but Squid Game is changing that for me because I just absolutely love the show so much and can't stop watching it, even though it is really disturbing and is making me anxious when I fall asleep. It's so good. It's worth it. 
[P66]  Okay, next, water carbonator. For like the last year now, I have been obsessed with drinking sparkling water with apple cider vinegar in it. In fact, that was in my last list of things that I like. That still remains, okay? I still am drinking that every single day, all the time.

[P27]  can help clear pores and reduce breakouts. Retinol can help reduce hyperpigmentation caused by sun damage, hormonal changes, or acne scarring. Retinol can help even out skin tone by increasing cell turnover. Retinol increases cell turnover, which exfoliates the skin and allows new skin cells to grow. Retinol neutralizes free radicals in the middle layer of the skin. Retinol blocks inflammation pathways in the skin. Start slowly and gradually increase your use of 
[P28]  That is the brief summary of retinol, okay? And retinol has been sort of in the zeitgeist, in the skincare zeitgeist over the last few years. I've seen a lot of dermatologists talking about it on YouTube, like making videos about it. I've seen a lot of skincare influencers talking about it. 
[P29]  it. Not even like skincare influencers, but like lifestyle influencers, just showing them using retinol. And I've been sort of curious about it, but I have really sensitive skin and I was sort of overwhelmed. Like I'm in such a good routine. I don't even know where to start when it comes to finding a retinol. But then I randomly got sent a retinol from a really reputable brand. And I was like, you know what? I'm just going to try it. Like I've been sort of in the same skincare routine. 
[P30]  for a long time. I'm at a point now where I can be really intuitive. Like I know what products to use when, depending on how my skin is feeling. And so I was like, I feel like I'm intuitive enough with my skin these days that I can integrate something new and I'll be able to tell if it's not working. Anyway, I started using it. I'm using sort of a retinol oil and I'm having no issues, okay, at all. Like my skin is loving it. 
[P31]  Does my skin look, you know, completely different than I did before? No, but I think my skin is reacting well to it. And I'm really making sure to like start slow, you know, not use too much product. And it's freaking working for me. And it's exciting because I really like the idea of using really good products on my skin that can, you know, potentially help keep the skin looking as good as possible. 
[P32]  possible without like having to go in and start getting Botox and stuff. Like, listen, I'm not judging. I don't care. Do whatever you want. But I am going to wait for as long as I possibly can, maybe even never participate in these sorts of anti-aging procedures. I don't want to do that, right? That's just not my vibe. So it's exciting to me to find something that, you know, 
[P33]  are like, this is a really great product and the results are really good. And it's like natural enough. I don't know. It's exciting. It's obvious. Listen, this is all obvious, right? Like, but I don't know. This is like an exciting ingredient for me to integrate into my routine. And so far my skin has been reacting really well to it. I'll keep you updated. And hopefully I just look completely smooth as a baby in a few months after using retinol for a while. We'll see. 
[P34]  Okay, moving on to two sort of games, okay? One is a board game. One is not really a board game. I don't even know. It's a dice game. I'm obsessed with physical games, okay? I'm really loving it, but these two in particular are my current obsessions. Number one, the dice game Yahtzee. I've heard of Yahtzee before. I've seen senior citizens playing it before.

主题：重复穿搭的舒适体验

输入内容：
[P117]  do this is because I work from home for the most part. So like I wear comfy clothes for the most part. And I actually go out and see people only a handful of times a week. And so I'm talking about every time I go out and leave the house and I'm, you know, dressed up, I'm wearing the same outfit. Now, the truth of the matter is like the only people I'm seeing over and over again are people that I don't care if they see me wearing the same outfit over and over again. Right. So it works out. And what I like about it is that 
[P118]  It's sort of like a micro uniform. It's like a short term uniform, which I'm really enjoying because I do love the element of like not having to choose. And that's something I've been struggling with for a long time is feeling like, oh, my God, I feel like every day I want to have a new outfit. You know, every time I leave the house, I want to be in something fresh. I used to feel a lot of pressure to do that. And that just like got old for me, you know, and I was like, well, maybe I should have a uniform. 
[P119]  But then that was too extreme for me because I was like, I do enjoy fashion a bit too much to have a full-on uniform. You know what I'm saying? So that's not going to work. So then I ended up narrowing down my closet to something that's a bit more concise. Many people do not agree with me. As I've shown my closet collection on my YouTube channel, and many people were like, that is a massive closet filled with clothes. Yes, but it is far more concise. 
[P120]  far more themed than ever before where everything sort of matches, et cetera. It's as close to a capsule wardrobe as I've ever been. Narrowing down the closet to a bunch of stuff that all kind of matches and goes together that is more timeless and buildable combined with sort of this limited uniform structure where like I'll pick out one outfit that I really like and then just wear it for like three or four weeks straight over and over again. It's working out really well where, you know, 
[P121]  my closet is getting its moment. Things are not getting neglected. I pick out an outfit that I really, really love and then I get to just enjoy it. That's not to say like I wear this exact same outfit every single time I leave the house. It's not like a structured rule. It's just something that I've recently allowed myself to do, which I didn't before. A good example of one, I have this like slightly cropped pair of olive green like work pants. I was wearing those with cream 
[P122]  socks, black flats, simple black flats, black and white striped shirt, black cardigan. I've worn that a billion times. I had this other one that I wore a billion times, which was a pair of capris with a black long sleeve. Okay. Stick with me here. A black long sleeve with a white tank top over it with a lace like half top over that. Okay. So it's like a bunch of layers. 
[P123]  And then little white socks and little cream tabby flats and little black sunglasses and a little olive green bag. I wore that. I've worn that so many times. I'm actually still wearing that one. Like if I go out this weekend to do something interesting, I'm going to wear that outfit again. Another one I had was dark gray dress pants. Black. I have these black like tabby shoes that are like leather, like almost like a loafer looking thing. Anyways. 
[P124]  And I was wearing that with just a simple black turtleneck. And if it was cold, a little black cardigan on top of that. I wear that all the time. That outfit really gets worn. Anyway, but it's just like these little micro uniforms. Like all of these, I've probably worn each of those ones that I just listed at least 10 times each within the last six months. And I know what you're thinking, Emma, this is normal. Like normal people wear the same outfit over and over again. 
[P125]  For many years, I had a fucking insane closet filled with a bunch of random shit that I had collected over the years that made no sense and had no sense of like, this is what Emma likes or this is a good building block for Emma. It was just a big fucking clusterfuck of God knows what that I thrifted or whatever that I thought was cute or could be something in the moment, but actually was not good for me at all. But I just bought it anyway because I had a shopping addiction. And then me feeling like, oh my God, every day I need to wear something new. 
[P126]  I have so many clothes. Like I need to constantly be wearing new things. I can't re-wear outfits. It's like not, it's taboo. Like all this, like even though I knew that that was stupid, I still felt the pressure. So this is new for me. You know, it's toxic. It's also like, it's cringe. Like it's a, it's cringe for me to be like, oh my God, I'm wearing the same outfit twice. I'm like, I'm obsessed, but it's true. And so that's why I'm mentioning it. Okay, moving on. I've put this on the list before. I'm going to put it on the list again. I love my fucking 
[P127]  Stanley Cup. In fact, I have two Stanley Cups or three. I can't remember. I have three. I use all three. Okay. So let's not be like, okay, Emma, like Stanley Cup over consumer. Why do you need three? No, I use all three. No, I do. That's the thing. That's the thing. I use all three. Okay. And I absolutely love them. And the reason why I bring this up is because we all shit on the Stanley Cup culture because it's become this trend to like collect every color.

[P98]  Can you – I'm curious now with everything in the rearview mirror and having built what you built and knowing what you know, what do you think that – what do you wish you had known in 2008 when you were starting your business that you think might have been helpful for you to know or to be aware of? In 2008. 2008. I'm trying to put myself back in that spot. Yeah. 
[P99]  If I could do anything over again, if I could sit down with my younger self, I would say the entrepreneurial journey is so thrilling, but so intensely difficult. Don't make it harder on yourself by carrying around self-doubt. It's like carrying around a backpack full of boulders. It just makes everything harder and it's unnecessary. And it gets a lot more fun. 
[P100]  If you let go of the idea of, can I do it? And you just say, I will do it. Awesome. Vicki, thank you so much. Thank you, Guy. I can't wait to see you and have cake and a mug. We will. I'll be wearing fabulous jewelry and I'll be smelling good. That's Vicki Tsai, co-founder and former CEO of Tatcha.

主题：Tatcha创始人创业故事分享

输入内容：
[P5]  So today we are going to talk to founders who are taking, you know, a lot of them are taking some big career moves to bring their business ideas to life. And we thought you would be the perfect person to give them advice because you started Tatcha after making this really big pivot in your career. You worked in corporate finance. You worked for Starbucks. But you kind of became disillusioned with that world after a while. Not Starbucks, but just kind of corporate life. 
[P6]  Japan and you met at Geisha and you started using skincare products that they had and it just kind of changed your life and inspired you to build this company. And this was back in 2008. And you struggled for some time to build Hatcha, but of course now it is a huge multi-million dollar company now owned by Unilever. Such an awesome story. We are going to put a link to it in the show description. 

[P7]  a couple questions. At what point did you feel like you could jump fully into this? Because you went to business school, you got the brass ring jobs, you were on the path to sort of corporate success. And you come, you know, you came from a family that really emphasized success and achievement. I remember you talking about this. And at what point did you feel like, I don't, it doesn't matter. I just can't do this anymore. I've got to do this other thing. 
[P8]  quit my day job without any safety net because I felt that corporate life was so soul-crushing. And I just thought, if I continue doing this, there's a 100% chance I'll be unhappy. If I try something new, there's a 50% chance I'll be happy. And so I left with no plan and no idea. I didn't think I was going to start a company. I just knew I couldn't keep doing what I was doing. And then I stumbled upon Tatcha. 

[P9]  Awesome. One of the things I remembered after our interview in 2020 is that at the time you had let you kind of step down as CEO. And then you actually came back and to lead Tatcha as CEO in 2021, a little bit like Howard Schultz, who's been back for the CEO three times. Can you talk a little bit about the decision, the original decision to step down and then the decision to come back? 
[P10]  after we brought in private equity in 2018. Yeah. Because they recommended that we bring in a seasoned leadership team. And it really triggered this imposter syndrome in me that I had carried for my career. And I thought, I don't want to be the kind of founder that ends up limiting the potential of their business because of their own leadership limitations. So I stepped down and I welcomed with open arms, 
[P11]  a new leadership team. And then a couple years later, Unilever asked me to come back. So 2021, in the midst of COVID and in the midst of API hate, we also did a turnaround. It was an honor to be able to step back in, and it gave me the opportunity to lead in a different way that I never thought possible. And then at the end of that year, I actually put in place a new leadership team, including a new CEO. 

[P13]  tend to experience this more than men. But I think lots of founders experience this feeling of like, okay, now we're really big. Maybe I'm not the right person to do this. And it's a very natural feeling to have. But you sort of said to yourself, wait a minute, no, I can do this. Yeah, yeah. It forced me to be curious about where those ideas came from in the first place. Why had I believed that I didn't have what it took? Because I had the experience and I had the track record. 
[P14]  the numbers were there. But I think I had internalized a lot of feedback over time. And when you're an entrepreneur, as you know, you get so many no's and so many people doubting you that you have to become your own hype machine in your head. And every day you have to be like, I can do it. I can do it. But some part for me crept in. And that little bit of leakage eventually was enough to overflow 
[P15]  my sense of self-worth and self-confidence. And then I had to watch the company disintegrate for two years from my perspective. And that was what caused me to come back and say, I don't know why I doubted myself like that, but it's time to get to work. There's not really time for doubt right now. That's a bit of a luxury I don't have. So let's finish what we started. And it was a joy. It was a joy. Yeah. Yeah. Your Steve Jobs moment.

主题：蛋糕品牌Mugsy Bakes创业咨询

输入内容：
[P71]  yourself, tell us where you're calling from, and a little bit about your business. Hi, Guy. Hi, Vicki. Thank you so, so much for having me. Hello. My name is Devin Clymer. I am calling in from Cleveland, Ohio, and I am the co-founder of Mugsy Bakes. We make single-serve gluten-free mug cake mixes designed to spark dessert joy. No oven required. No oven required. Oh, so not even a microwave oven? A microwave. 
[P72]  But no, like real oven. Right. Yeah. And this is like mug cakes, right? You see these things on Instagram. But this is specifically like a packet, like a hot cocoa type packet that you just pour into a mug and add water and stick it in the microwave? Exactly right. So we like to say that making a mugsy is as easy as one, two, three. You literally just add in the wet ingredients, pour in the mugsy dry ingredients, mix it up and pop it in the microwave and you're done. And then you get a cake in a mug. Exactly. 

[P73]  Exactly right. It's a beautiful thing. Gluten-free. Uh-huh. And dairy-free too, actually. And dairy-free. Wow. Yeah. Tell me about how this started. Are you in the food business? 
[P74]  a hospital system together. And, you know, we watched as a lot of our patients, you know, struggled with chronic illness and often due to, you know, a broken food system. And so food was just very much so a part of our day in and day out. And ultimately, you know, it is that that inspired us to create our Better For You, but super, you know, vibrant, celebratory baking mix brand. 
[P75]  How did you guys decide to come up with it? Tell me the story. Were you sitting down in the cafeteria at the hospital, wherever you guys work? You're like, let's make mug cakes. You know what? At the time when we kind of went in on this together, we actually both had our own private practices. And so we would do a lot of co-working together. We would meet at coffee shops and talk. And I am a very avid listener of how I built this. Thank you. 
[P76]  And really, you know, just after listening to, you know, so many of the episodes and I relate to you, Vicky, as well, you know, just with making a pivot and doing something different and feeling like I am doing something that, you know, is really adding to my happiness is something I had just been thinking about. So I have been making mud cake mixes myself for years. 
[P77]  And so I started talking to Nina about this idea. And she's like, oh my gosh, I love this. And the rest is history. We just jumped in together. 

[P78]  So we do stand-up pouches. They are single-serve stand-up pouches. So think of almost like, you know, a pancake mix pouch, but smaller. And so it stands up on its own. And we use a recyclable one as well. And do you use sugar or sugar substitutes? So we use organic sugars, organic cane and coconut sugar. And, you know, really priding ourselves on, you know, the high-quality ingredients that we are using. 
[P79]  is really important to us for sure, especially given our healthcare background. Cool. All right. And what's your question for us today? Yes. So my question is we are currently pre-launch. We're kind of soft launching our minimum viable product at the moment locally in markets and shops. In Cleveland. In Cleveland, correct. Yes. And we will soon be launching direct to consumer. We are very close to having our finalized packaging ready. 

[P80]  So my question is, what would be your top tip for a new brand, you know, looking to generate buzz and more importantly, build a community when we have essentially, you know, no following or a very little following? Yeah. Vicky, your thoughts? I love how everybody who's been on has such a pure and uplifting intention. And their products and their brands are expressions of, 
[P81]  of how they'd like to make the world a little bit more beautiful, a little bit more confident, a little bit more joyful. I think we need so many more businesses like this. So yes. What do you think the use case is for your customers to want to purchase this? There's the health component, but like there's something to do with your kids. Is it something to use at parties? Is it a snack? What is it? Yes. So really it's the convenience factor that we are hypothesizing will be, you know, a big draw. 
[P82]  And it's meant to just serve as that, you know, simple pleasure, you know, that moment of joy after a long day. You know, I enjoy mine after I've gotten my kids to bed and, you know, while my husband is doing the dishes or cleaning up the toys. But certainly, too, you know, we envision kids perhaps, you know, with a gluten allergy, going to a birthday party and being able to have something that they can eat as well. So it can certainly serve multiple purposes. 

[P83]  allied health professionals, we think this would be a wonderful product as well for senior citizens who maybe can no longer cook like they used to. But really, it's the convenience, the ease factor to it that we think is a big part of our value proposition. For when you absolutely need cake, which I love. I feel like I need cake every day. Yes, yes. Do you remember, I think it still exists. It must still exist. 
[P84]  made it in so long. But one of my great pleasures as a child was when my parents would come home with a Jiffy Pop pan and you would take the thing off and put it on the stovetop and shake it. And then that big foil would just blow up and then you'd rip it open. You'd have popcorn. Did you ever do that? Yes. And it was so fun. I remember it being like such a fun thing to do with my parents and my siblings. And we're going after the same type of thing with Mugsy. 
[P85]  Yes. 

[P86]  reusable mug. Maybe you just do like a limited series and you sell them at gift shops and the mug says something like, dad is the best. I don't know. I'm just trying to think of a lame sort of mug thing. But, you know, everybody. So that could be kind of a cool thing to try. I love that. Who do you imagine? I think this is another version of the question Vicky asked, which is who do you imagine using this? Like you mentioned senior citizens, but like at the end of the day, there is going to be a core type of user. 
[P87]  It's going to be kids. It's going to be, you know, sort of women between the ages of 20 and 30. It's going to be there's going to be a certain type of user. So in your mind, who do you envision buying this product? 
[P88]  that convenience factor, you know, whether they're preparing it for their kids or even for themselves, you know, because she's tired. She, you know, has a lot on her plate and at the end of the day doesn't even want to be mixing up a cake out of a, you know, traditional box mix. So that's really our target that we're going after. Vicki, I know that Devin's question was about how to build buzz. I think, and I'd be curious to get your take on this, 
[P89]  Instead of thinking building buzz sort of nationally, she's really got to build buzz in Cleveland first. And I feel like this is the perfect opportunity to start really showing people how this works. Literally have a microwave oven at a farmer's market and just make these. And just sort of start that way. What do you think? Yeah, I'm getting my head around it because I've never made cake in a mug before, but I do love cake. 
[P90]  So food operates on very low margins and it's low price point. And so you, in time, the goal, unless you want it to stay a small business, and I shouldn't assume, do you have dreams for this to become a billion dollar business or is it a jewel of a business that you want to create? Yes, we have big dreams. You know, we really want to take this as big as we can. Yeah. So your end goal is grocery distribution. 

[P91]  reverse engineer a strategy to get invited into grocery distribution. I think convenience is definitely one of your main selling points, but I think your point of difference is probably additionally the form factor and the health piece of it because you're both healthcare workers. So I think, Guy, you're right. This is one of those situations where you throw spaghetti at the wall, whether it's food fairs and 
[P92]  farmers markets for local buzz, as well as social media content that shows your intention and your thoughtfulness behind the ingredients. On your own website, that's where you'd want to build the business first. And these are lightweight and easy to ship. So you might even want to create like a gifting program online. I'm going back to Guy's idea about the mugs and my original question about occasions. If you have 
[P93]  birthday kits or I love that yeah I almost want you to do something like really unexpected too like sorry you had a bad day at work sorry your boss boss sucks sorry about your celiac you know like things that that will kind of cut through I love that's so cool sorry he dumped you yeah I love that or like or like make your own mug cake birthday party packet like where everybody gets their own thing and they can make their own cake and then you'd have like a squeezy little tube of 
[P94]  frosting that you could frost it with. I love this. And that is just getting my mind buzzing. And those are wonderful recommendations. So thank you for that. Do you know what I've become obsessed with on social media? For some reason, I get fed these videos of like bread in an oven baking. Basically, you're looking at inside of an oven, like through the glass, and you just see the bread, like it goes in, you know, the dough, and then you just see it grow, grow, grow, 
[P95]  to this beautiful baguette or croissant. And I could just watch those all day with like beautiful, you know, like the music from Amelie behind it or something, you know, it's just, and so I can imagine just like the sound of like two hands, like a hand, like ripping open the packet, pouring it in the mug, putting in the, whatever it is, is it water and butter? I don't know. And then putting in the microwave and then just watching it grow into this like pop over cake. Yes, I love that. 
[P96]  that's definitely an avenue we will go down. And I know, you know, myself and Nina included, we're ready to get more comfortable on social media because truthfully, that's an area that I, you know, don't have a ton of experience in. But I love that idea of getting creative with our videos and really showing, you know, not only what this product is, but how you could use it, how you can make it fun and different and unique to you. So thank you. 
[P97]  The brand is called Mugsy Bakes. Good luck. Congrats on the launch. Thank you. Now I want some Mugsy. Now I feel like I need a cake in a mug right now. Thank you. Yes. Thank you both so much. Thank you, Vicky. Thank you, Guy. This was truly amazing. Thank you. Yeah. You can make cake in a mug. You didn't know. I feel like I haven't even lived. Vicky, before I let you go,

主题：护肤品牌Bea创业历程与咨询

输入内容：
[P45]  Welcome to the advice line. Please tell us your name, where you're calling from, and just a little bit about your business. Hi, Vicki. Hi, Guy. Thank you so much for having me. So excited to meet you. And I'm calling in from New York City right now. I'm the founder and CEO of Beya, Beya's premium vegan skincare that addresses intimate concerns. So thanks, sweat, odor, body blemishes that affect our confidence. 
[P46]  how you started this. So I actually wrote in my second grade journal that one day. Second grade. Second grade. I wrote in my journal that I was going to have a beauty company one day. And at 16 years old, I asked my grandma for a investment of, I think, $500, which was a lot of money. And I started Below Cosmetics, which was a mascara brand. And I very quickly learned how hard it is to start a beauty business. 

[P47]  When did you start B-Low Cosmetics? How old were you? I was 16 because I didn't have business courses in high school. So I was like, I think I love business, but I have no idea, like, will I actually like it? That's a great name. B-Low Mascara, your name. It's awesome. And did you make mascara? Did you sell it? I did. So it's hilarious to look at my emails with this contract manufacturer. I was like, I would love to meet with you. I would love to share my vision with you. 
[P48]  so seriously. I think I ordered, I forget what the minimum was. I think it was 2,500 mascaras. It had the logo on it. And it was amazing, but we still probably have like 10 cases of mascaras at my parents' house to this day. I can't believe you were 16. Okay. So obviously you were on a mission from a young age to start a beauty brand. And how did you get, I mean, tell me a little bit about Bea. 

[P49]  How did that idea come about? So I ended up graduating from Babson College and I had a full time offer with L'Oreal. But again, I wrote my second grade journal that I was going to have my own company. And so I was like, wait a minute, I got to do my own thing. But where's the white space in the product world of beauty? Because it's so saturated. And I honestly couldn't come up with a good enough idea. And that's when Drybar and a lot of these beauty services were popping up. 
[P50]  is the next best thing is creating a service company where I work with real women to understand their beauty pain points. So then I could build this product business. So I ended up turning down L'Oreal and starting my first company, Butini. And so what was fascinating is we really do specialize in weddings and events. And so they would come in and be like, listen, I'm getting married in August. I sweat like crazy. Is my makeup going to melt off? Or like when I sweat, I smell, I'm going to be hugging my guests. 
[P51]  let alone let's talk about my wedding night. What do you do? And I was like, wait, that's kind of, I've never heard these questions. I guess it's a beauty question, but I honestly have these insecurities of like smelling and being around people. And I just thought that was a me thing. And so that's what I was like, wait a minute. Well, fast forward pandemic, there were no weddings, there were no events. So there was no business for Butini. So rather than just sitting around, I realized it was my perfect opportunity to start Bea. And our whole philosophy is like taking moments 
[P52]  yourself. So whether it's like taking deep breaths and just rehydrating your face and body or, you know, going into the bathroom and refreshing so you feel a little bit more confident, that's like the whole ethos of the brand. That's so awesome. I'm thinking about how much I smell right now because I took a run before this interview and I'm so happy that I'm in a separate studio from you because I would need Bea right now. I wish I could teleport them to you right now. 

[P53]  What's your question for us today? So my question is, if you were building a skincare brand, say Taja in 2024, what would be like the top three things that you would be focusing on right now? Knowing that, you know, you want to be on QVC, you want to land a retailer like Sephora, like what there's so many things to do as a founder. What would be your top three areas of focus? All right, Vicky. Yeah, let's start. 
[P54]  with you? Well, I really love that you're focusing on Femcare because this is a really hot new area. So when you go to a category that's growing, you get to sort of ride the wave up. And I get tapped a lot for advice or investment in growing Femcare brands. So this is of the moment. So good job on timing. So to your question about how to break through these days, we were talking in the last one about how people don't buy products now. 
[P55]  So your point of difference will not just be your products and your formulary promise, but your intentions. Why do you exist? When you break through, particularly in social media, then those retailers come to you. So you can pitch Sephora all day long, but they get pitched all day long. What you really want is for them to come to you. And they're going to come to you when you break through with your clients. So I would almost say, don't worry about the retailers, build it and they will come. 
[P56]  why she needs this, why to believe in you and why you care so much about her. Oh, that's really great advice. I love that. And honestly, we've had a few dream retailer like reach out. And it's interesting because you can get into a retailer and that's great. But that's when the hard work I found out happens, right? Like if people don't know about your brand and don't understand your mission, it's not going to succeed in store. So I think that's like that's very valuable insight for me. 

[P57]  to really implement. Brittany, can you talk a little bit about your sales right now, where you guys are at? So we're about, we should be ending this year about a million. And so we've had some great beauty subscription boxes that have, we've gotten a big deal with that. We were named, yeah, like a top 25 indie beauty from CEW, which is a beauty professional organization. So it's still small, but I'm self-funding. 
[P58]  like Vicki, just really being very mindful because my life mission is to empower women to feel confident in their own skin. And I want to be able to figure out those pain points and that storytelling that resonates with people before we think about investment and whatnot. And how many people do you have working with you now? So it's myself and one full-time employee, one part-time, and then we have a handful of freelancers on retainer. Right. You know, one of the cool things about this product 
[P59]  as you say, it's an opportunity to show people how to use it. I think of two brands we've had on the show in the past. One is Dollar Shave Club. One is Liquid Death. And these brands, what they did early on when they had no money, no budgets, was to put like $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 into making a very low budget, low quality, but very funny video. 
[P60]  That would go that would eventually go viral. You can imagine I can imagine you or somebody putting something like that together around. I mean, you've got, you know, these wipes, for example, to refresh wipes or, you know, I see body and intimacy serum. Like there are lots of fun things you could do with with the products you have. And so I wonder whether whether you've you've thought about doing something like that, trying to create like a low budget video. 
[P61]  funny in that sort of dollar shave club way. Would you say like just do one where you're really storytelling and thinking it through versus let's make a TikTok and see what sticks? I try both, but I would try to make them funny if you can, because you're talking about your story about talking to people getting ready for weddings and you're thinking, wait, I'd be freaked out about if I smell, not if my makeup was running, you know, and I feel like smell and scent is so funny. And it's 
[P62]  We all smell. Human beings smell like there's no way around it. There's no human that does not smell. I feel like there's a lot of fun around that idea. I love that. And I think, well, my personal need for these wipes was because I was dating in New York City and you're at a hot, sweaty bar. And then maybe, you know, you meet someone and then I would be so self-conscious about my smell. So I do think I love that idea of like storyboarding something that's really funny and hopefully relatable. 

[P63]  to be able to resonate in like a lighthearted way, but hopefully get some variety behind it. I love Guy's idea. And the fact that this started from your dating moments, it would be fun to partner with like a Tinder or, I don't know, what do people use these days? Bumble, the coffee meets bagel. I don't know any of these anymore. You could put together like a little kit called like, in case it goes well, and, you know, just sort of do a co-marketing event to try to get into that kind of audience. 
[P64]  But I would try to, first of all, a million dollars on that small of a team is amazing. Congratulations. The first million is the hardest by far. I thought the first million was harder than the first hundred million. Really? No way. Yeah, I really do. I really, really do. But then when it comes to a retailer, they'll throw anything against the wall. But if you don't climb rank very quickly, you're out. And then it's like a stain. It's like a scarlet letter A. Then you can't raise money. Then you can't get other. 
[P65]  I would really try to get the fire and the buzz going before you go to a retailer because there's also fixed costs, CapEx that goes with going into retail. And in an ideal world, you're on fire. They come to you. They take a few items. They put them on an indie wall and they fly off the shelf. And then then the party starts. And would you say that QVC is considered a retailer or would you say that's also part of like that brand awareness built because you get to storytell? 
[P66]  QVC is interesting because they are, if I remember correctly, they're a consignment model. And you have to build a lot of inventory to test it out. And if it doesn't sell through, you own it. But you have to repack it at a cost of $4 to $5 per kit in order to even be able to resell it. You also have to look at different retailers have different customer bases with different return profiles. 
[P67]  on a successful run, 50% of your stuff gets returned. And that's stuff that you trash. You have to look at your margins. So I would say some retailers, they're great for awareness when you can handle that level of risk. And as a self-funded business, that's probably not what we can afford to do at this point. So I agree with you that maybe, like I think, Guy, what you're saying is like build up like the storytelling in a really fun, relatable way. 
[P68]  And you are the perfect person to do this. You got me from the second grade. Yeah, I agree with Guy. We just need you all over TikTok. Yeah, that's awesome. It's awesome. The brand is called Bea. Brittany Lowe, congrats. Good luck. We're going to be cheering you on and we'll be following up. Thank you so much for your advice. Can't wait. And I'll be manifesting Bea being next to Tatcha and Sephora one day. Love it. Thank you so much. Love it. Thank you.

主题：珠宝品牌Petite Anjou咨询交流

输入内容：
[P16]  you know, coming back to lead the company or Howard Schultz moment. Vicki, what do you say we take our, go ahead and take our first call? I can't wait. All right, let's do it. Hello, caller number one, please introduce yourself. Tell us where you are calling from and a little bit about your business. Hi, Guy. Hi, Vicki. Thank you so much for having me here. Hello. My name is Jessica Liu. I'm calling from Newport Beach, California, and I'm the founder of Petite Anjou. 
[P17]  playfully sculptural aesthetic. Amazing. Okay. And first of all, tell us a little bit about the business. Do you buy the jewelry from somewhere else? Do you make it? Tell me about it. No, everything is handcrafted by myself. I'm a self-taught metalsmith. I tend to gravitate towards making organic and flowy designs with a bit of texture. But I also really struggle with sensitive skin. I know, Vicki, you can relate. 
[P18]  I don't use brass in my studio. So most of my pieces come in sterling silver or 18 karat gold vermeil. And I'm in the process of rolling out a fine jewelry collection as well. Okay. So you are a metalsmith, which is awesome. I mean, because, you know, I think you think of metalsmithing. I think of like the 19th century, like a guy in a hammering away at a horseshoe. Do you have an art background, a design background? Is that where this comes from? No, completely different. I actually come from the corporate world. I used to be an attorney. 
[P19]  And I've been listening to the show for ages. I was always so inspired by the female founders in particular. And so I wanted to create my own thing. And I read the story about this woman who made a jewelry business curating designs. And I thought I could do that. But I couldn't find designs that resonated with me. So I decided I was going to make my own, what I couldn't find out there. And so I taught myself. I watched YouTube videos. I bought all the books. And pretty much after my kids would go down for the night, I would stay up late at night teaching myself. 
[P20]  I'm kind of blown away. I mean, you were a lawyer who taught yourself on YouTube, and now I'm looking at your website, Petty Anjou, and these are really beautiful, complex designs. I mean, congrats on the business. And what's your question for me and Vicky today? 
[P21]  to give out samples or do gifting to influencers or editors as part of a marketing strategy. And roughly, what's the price ranges of your products? They start at around $195 and go up to about $1,600. Right, because you're dealing with gold and silver. Okay, fair enough. All right, Vicki, let's see what we can do here. Jessica's got, she makes everything. They're beautiful products, handmade, high quality, but it's challenging, right? This is all direct to consumer. Jessica, right? You're not selling in stores. 

[P22]  First of all, any thoughts, Vicky, about her approach? What do you think? I love what you do. I love the intention and the craftsmanship and the quality. I think your brand is exactly the kind of brand that people are looking for these days. They're sick of stuff that just falls off a factory line somewhere else in the world and that doesn't have a heart and a soul and a purpose for being. And I think people don't buy products these days. They join brands. If I were in your shoes, a couple ideas. 
[P23]  into the craftsmanship piece of your work. You're not competing with someone who's buying stock jewelry, putting their brand name on it and selling it on their website. You are looking for a client that cares about craftsmanship and wants to know their maker. So I don't know if you're doing this already, but really allowing people to see the work that goes into crafting your products from the design to the making. TikTok is a really great place for that. 
[P24]  The other thing is inventory. Are each of your pieces one of a kind or do you sort of make a little inventory of each? I do have an inventory of each. So I do maintain stock of each design. Got it. So to just manage your overall capital outlay, one potential is to only make one of each design, show it to people, and then if they want it, then they get part of the drop and say, I'll make 10. 
[P25]  and you eventually scale from there. So just sort of shifting the product development cycle will help your capital cycle. And then in terms of gifting, I actually have the same problem. Our things are handmade in Japan. And so when we send people four pieces, it costs about the same, I'm guessing, as one of your pieces. And so you can sample yourself out of business. We didn't do broad sampling the way that most beauty brands do. 
[P26]  And we also did not do heavy celebrity sampling the way that most beauty brands do. Instead, we thought about how to turn our best clients into advocates and ambassadors for us because we found that they really loved gifting our products. And so I don't know if you have a really passionate group of clients already, but talking to them and asking them about how you can serve them more and then, you know, 
[P27]  that might be something that's giftable and let them become the people who get the word out for you. I love that because something I've really grown to appreciate as a small business owner is the sense of community. And people really do buy into brands. That's what they're interested in, in being part of a community and part of the experience. And so I do try to showcase the craftsmanship on my Instagram page. But you're right, I do think that I could do more of that, maybe even on the website. That's actually a great idea to showcase that. 

[P28]  more. I think it's all TikTok. Yeah. Yeah. If you go to the about page on, on your website, it's awesome. You've got these photos of you in the, in the shop and you do with a soldering iron or whatever it is. And, and they, you know, basically melting down metal. It's so cool. And I think about, do you make videos of you making jewelry? I do. I, to the best of my ability with my iPhone, it's not great cinematography, but I do try to capture the process because I think people love to see where 
[P29]  pieces are coming from. You know, like you said, Vicki, it's not off of a conveyor belt. You know, each piece is handcrafted. And I think people want to see their piece being made right in front of them. How have you tried to build awareness so far? So actually, when I first started, I did hire a PR agency. I used them for a few months before quickly realizing that it wasn't going to be economically viable as a startup. So I do my own PR at this point. I've reached out to editors. 
[P30]  program. Um, and so I've landed a few editorial mentions and TV spots. Um, but you know, it's like I mentioned, it's tricky cause I can't give them samples to try in person. So it's kind of like, here's my jewelry, you know, it's great. Just trust me on it. Um, also I've been trying to do more in-person shows. Um, I love live events because it lets me meet my audience and see what they gravitate towards. Um, it's almost like market research for me too. Um, but the trick with that, the tricky 
[P31]  has been that a lot of my local events tend to be like craft shows that are at a lower price point. And so I'm not sure if my audience is really there shopping for high-end jewelry. So it's kind of been a balancing act navigating that. Jessica, did you hear, we did an episode a few years back with, on MM LeFleur, with Sarah LeFleur, who founded this apparel brand. And essentially the idea in her mind, because Sarah came from, you know, 

[P32]  was to make clothing, you know, sort of a wardrobe, a uniform. So women wouldn't have to like spend hours every morning trying to figure out what to wear, but it was a clothing design for professional women. It's an amazing brand. I found out about it like I often do for my wife who would go and buy their clothing. And I feel like there's something to that idea with what you're doing. And I mean, given your background as a lawyer and what you are creating, I wonder whether there's a way to kind of tap into 
[P33]  you know, this sort of networks of professional women who are going to the office. And because the pieces that you create are very timeless and very, they're just very classic. And so I don't know, have you explored that at all? Yeah, no, you're absolutely right. You know, I think my pieces are timeless and elegant and my audience is looking for something like that, but they want something that's unique and different. You know, my audience is not, 
[P34]  interested in blending in with everyone else. And like you mentioned, they're very professional. They're accomplished. They're strong women. And so they are looking for something that's going to make a statement that they can wear every day, be comfortable in. So that is something that I would love to pursue further, kind of promoting that angle of something that you can live in every day. Guy makes a really great point. Because of your craftsmanship, you're not looking for 100,000 clients yet. 
[P35]  You want like a thousand great ones. And so being clear on who your bullseye is, both demographically and psychographically will help you stay super, super focused. I think you're right. Trunk shows will be better for you than craft shows. I wonder whether to Guy's point, whether you could partner with a complimentary clothing brand or bag brand where you can help each other, where your ethos is the same. 
[P36]  email list with each other, do trunk shows together. I love that. And that's actually something that's been suggested to me before the collaborations, because you share each other's audiences as well. And that's something I'm looking forward to pursuing, for sure. Congrats on what you're building, Jessica. It's so cool. I mean, jumping out of the corporate world as a lawyer and going into something totally creative is really courageous. And I really can't wait to see what you

I think life is so exciting. And when I find something that interests me, I like to dive in more to it. So I have a lot of passions, I would say. I love it.

[P21]  sharing my story and empowering other people to uplift them and to know that they can do it as well. Yeah, and you do a lot of work in communities and specifically empowering women, women in business, right? When did that become a passion of yours? It became a passion when I actually started network marketing and I grew my team to be pretty large. And then I started doing individual one-on-one sessions with all of the girls on my team. And I really got to know their story. 
[P22]  I got to know their why or their because. And it really helped. And I grew up, I have my master's degree in educational leadership. And I used to be a teacher for over 10 years. So I think it's just that nurturing in me and wanting to help people get better. And so it really developed, I would say, network marketing. And it made me have the confidence and the belief in myself that I can help other women and I don't have to be defined by the past. So that's where it really stemmed from when I started my business.

[P11]  be defined by my circumstances and what I went through and I can completely change the trajectory of my life. That's amazing. And thank you for sharing that. And I want to ask you somewhat of a deeper question, right? Because just like you, some different experiences with my father. What was it like growing up? And it's like you have friends that like maybe they're sleepovers and it's like, oh, wait, I don't want you to come to my house, right? Because I remember going through that, right? Like I'll go to you, but I don't want you coming here. 
[P12]  was that like for you? Like growing up, right? Like all children do, you've got, you have friends. And I think for, for folks like Samantha and I growing up a little early because you, you become aware of surroundings and you become aware of, oh, wait, this isn't what everybody goes through. This is just happening here. What was that like for you? Like, how did that shape like friendships and the things that most kids got to do or wanted to do that maybe you didn't do, or you had to shelter that from other people too? 
[P13]  had so much shame around my house and where I grew up. My parents both smoked and I cannot stand cigarettes to this day. And my father and my mother are, they like to hoard things. So I would always be the one cleaning up the house and trying to make it look amazing if I had anyone over. But to be honest, I've never even had this conversation with anyone, but I would always go to my friend's house. I would always make some excuse. We would always go over there. I was very embarrassed to 
[P14]  to go to, to have anyone come over. And it's still hard for me going to my parents' house, seeing the way that they live. And it's really sad. Um, but again, it gives me a lot of compassion and I find myself too in my adulthood because a lot of the generational traumas that you go through, there's trauma responses that you have to work through. And I realized that I'm bringing that into my adulthood. So, I mean, I love my place. It looks beautiful, but 
[P15]  I still find myself going to other people's houses because that's how I grew up. And yeah, I would say I had a lot of shame around that. And it was always going over other people's places. You took that shame. You took the neglect that you felt like you had, right? And you turned it into power. So how did you take that? Or not even how did you take it? You didn't let that become who you are. You didn't let that define you. So for the viewers and listeners, right?

What's crazy is that we met for the first time, like October of last year, at an event in L.A., and we've been like besties since then. I know. It's been amazing being in contact with you,

[P60]  tremendous amount from him. So I would definitely say him. And I love Jeannie Kern Lima. I mean, her story of resilience and what she went through is just incredible. So I would say those would be my two top, but then I would also include Joe Dispenza as well. He's just incredible the way he thinks and his outlook and perspective on life. Good stuff. Good stuff. So again, honored to have you on today. Like what else does Samantha have going 
[P61]  on? What did we not say that you have going on that you have going on? What do you want to leave the listeners and viewers with? Yeah. So like I mentioned, we just launched our ebook. We just launched our website. So we started off the Light Up Your Life podcast as just doing that, but we're expanding it into a brand. And we're also starting weekly accountability meetings. So we're doing a women's empowerment group. So we're kicking that off really soon, which we're happy about. I feel like that's definitely the next step. 
[P62]  We want to make a huge difference in the world. So that's definitely going to be an avenue for us to be able to do so. Very good. Very good. So last thing, where can people follow and find you? And I'll make sure we have links to the ebook, to the website and everything in the show notes. But where do you want people to find and follow Samantha? You can find me on Instagram. It's my full name. It's Samantha Lynn Peters. And then our website is lightupyourlife.org. You are the greatest. My bestie, Samantha Lynn Peters. 
[P63]  much for taking time with us today. Thank you for having me. It's been a pleasure. You got it. And for all the listeners and viewers, remember your because is your superpower. Go Unleash It.

[P3]  You never know who you can meet. You never know what relationship you can cultivate. So it's been awesome. Yeah, I truly think it's the testament to not just networking, right? I think people go to a lot of events, but really going selflessly with the intent of getting to know the right people, having the right conversations with people, because you never know where that goes. And like I said, I mean, Samantha and I got to know each other in October. 
[P4]  because we probably are talking and sending each other inspiration and motivation through Instagram and all that. But how has that been an impact of your life, Samantha? Because I think you truly are the example of, you know, going to networking events purposely, right? Seeking the right people, making the right connections, but then doing what you do really well, which is following through and delivering on those meetings and on those conversations.

[P7]  that because we kind of told each other, let's wait for the podcast so that I can actually hear the story for the first time. So I know who you are today, right? Very dynamic person, but let's go back. Let's talk about what's defined and giving you the core values that you have today. So when you talk about the adversity that you had growing up, like let's define that a little bit. Yeah. So I grew up in a really toxic upbringing. My father's an alcoholic. He was heavy into Oxycontin. So that completely destroys your frontal lobe and your decision 
[P8]  factors. And I find before I felt like I was a victim to my circumstance, but I really realized and I did so much inner work to realize that he's hurting so much inside and hurt people hurt people. And so I looked at it from a different lens and I looked at him as a little boy being hurt by his parents and being abused and growing up in that environment. And unfortunately, he projected all of his pain, all of his insecurities on his children. 
[P9]  And obviously, I got the brunt of it. And it was just really hard because your father is supposed to be the one person that shows up for you, that loves you, that nurtures you, where you can build that safe trust. And I didn't have that. So I grew up putting a lot of guards in front of me and trying to protect my own peace and happiness. And I think the hardest part for me was understanding, like, why doesn't my father love me? 
[P10]  And so how can you love someone when you don't truly feel at peace with who you are, what you've been, and work through all of that? So it was really hard to go through those things. And I still honestly don't have a good relationship with him. But I feel like it's really made me dig deep to understand the psychology behind the way he is. And now I can show up and pray for him and give him compassion and love. But know that I don't have to live that way.

[P28]  levels. I don't want to, I don't want to gross out the viewers and listeners, but so when did that become a theme for you? Again, you talked about it earlier when you talked about, you care about what goes into your body and the amount and all that. So talk to us about that journey. Yeah. So growing up when I remember, I was in second grade, my mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and I saw her hooked up to all these IVs and it became really hard for her to walk. She ended up going on social security disability. She would 
[P29]  no longer works to this day. And she had cancer, congestive heart failure. My father has a bunch of other disabilities as well. So I saw that growing up and I firmly believe that your environment does shape your thoughts and your thoughts. When you're thinking negatively, that is putting cortisol in your body and it's running through you and it's toxic, it's acidic. So I had to really do a lot of work and wellness and know that what you, 
[P30]  your body, you become. And so if you're constantly eating sugar or carbs or things that are really unhealthy and processed, you're going to feel horrible. I don't know about you, but I eat something and I realize, okay, is this giving me energy or is this making you feel sluggish? And do I have brain fog from it? So if you want optimal performance, you need to be eating things that are very healthy for you. And I think just growing up and seeing the disease in my family and my grandmother passing away 
[P31]  from Alzheimer's, I'm doing everything in my power to figure out ways to anti-age, figure out ways to just optimize my health and wellness. And so it's been a big part of my journey. Wow, that's awesome. So you do that, you do a lot in beauty as well too. Like where did this thing for Samantha being, I'm gonna do, I'm not gonna say any and everything because you don't do any and everything, but I almost feel like you have your hand, like you have a lot of moving parts. You have a lot of things that are always going on. When did that become a part of you?

And I'm sure all of you have heard that you are the five people you surround yourself with. So I'm like, I need to get in rooms with people who think bigger than me, people who want to see me succeed, people who, and one of my coaches always tells me this, is like, you want to learn from people who have what you want, but more importantly, who have been where you are. 
[P6]  And I find all of these networking events, a lot of people have been through so much adversity. They've been through so many different challenges, but they were able to overcome them. And it's just really inspiring learning from all these people and getting to connect with them. So it's absolutely transformed my life. Wholeheartedly.

输入内容：
[P16]  What was the next step for Samantha? So talk about the things that you've done, like from education to the empowerment that you are so vastly involved in. Like, how did you go from, I'm taking this and turning it to a power and here's what I'm going to do. Yeah, I think one of my mentors, Ed Milad, he talks about being the one in your family to break all of generational curses. And I know this goes into my because as well, but I wanted to be the complete opposite of how I grew up. 
[P17]  drugs and that scarcity, that victim mindset, the disease. So I feed my body with the things that I need to feed my body with. I seek outside mentors who have what I want. And it's been hard. I think the hardest part for me was analyzing my thoughts and knowing that you create your own reality. So I think it's a hard perspective because society doesn't teach that your thoughts precede what happens in your external circumstances and not the other way around. A lot of people, 
[P18]  react to their environment and what they're seeing, not realizing that your thoughts create that. And so for me, it was really realizing and stopping all of those negative thought patterns and rewiring my brain to think in a more positive way, saying that just because I didn't have this as a child doesn't mean I can't have the abundance, the success, the wealth, the happiness as an adult. So it was a really huge mindset shift to analyze all my subconscious thought patterns and to rewire them. 
[P19]  to think in abundance and happiness and joy. Yeah, I love it. And so you kind of teased us with your because. So if we were to say today, what is Samantha Lynn Peters because? Yeah, I thought a lot about this and it goes back to what I previously said, but I'm going to be and I am the person that's breaking through all of these generational curses because when I grow up and have a family of my own, I never want them to have to go through what I went through, 
[P20]  abuse and the neglect and just the negativity. And so I am that person that's changing it for future generations. But I think deeper than that, too, it's showing people what's possible. You don't have to be defined by your circumstances. You can rise above. And there's people that want to see you and there's people that are going to show up for you. And I find a lot of times it's not even your direct family. It's strangers and people that you don't even know that really do want to help you.

[P51]  I'm ready. All right. So I'm not going to say it's your crazy nutrition regimen, but walk us through a breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack, whatever. Walk us through a day of Samantha Lynn Peters in the eating journey. So I do a lot of intermittent fasting. So I typically will skip breakfast and I juice right away. So I always juice celery juice in the morning, about 16 ounces. 
[P52]  I know a lot of people don't like celery. I'm already done. I can't even start, but go ahead. But it gives you so much mental clarity. And so I eat a lot of salads. I like to meal prep quite a bit too. So I don't do anything farm-raised. It's always wild-caught salmon, vegetables, anything you could think of, sautéed vegetables, organic chicken. I won't eat anything that's not organic. So vegetables, fruit. 
[P53]  Anything like that. That's what I'm eating for lunch and dinner. You lost me at the celery. I'm sorry. The celery juicing. I couldn't hear anything after you said that. I'm also, I like to do a lot of heavy metal detox as well. It just gives me so much more mental clarity. And so it has a lot of wild blueberries, an organic banana, spirulina powder, Atlantic dulce, which is actually seaweed from the ocean. 
[P54]  as well in there. And so I find that I feel incredible after I do take that smoothie. So that would be my regimen. All right. So I've always wanted to ask this question and you're the person that can answer it now. How much do you spend per month in all of that? I would say for the grocery store, I like things fresh. So I like to actually go to the grocery store and pick out what my produce looks like, my vegetables, my fruits. So I probably spend about $100 
[P55]  week on just on myself for groceries. Oh, that's not bad. It's not bad at all. No, no, that's not bad. I'll give it a try, but I'm not doing the celery juice. I can promise you. What if you mix it with something? It might taste a little better. No, celery's still in it. Celery's still in it. All right. So next question. Do you ever have like a cheat moment? Absolutely. So what's your go-to cheat meal or cheat dish or a cheat snack? I love anything with potatoes. So I do like truffle french fries.

[P40]  or which is going to help give you momentum in whatever you're doing. So I couldn't agree more with what you said. Very cool. Very cool. Again, you do a lot of things. You do a lot of things really, really well. So I applaud you for that. And, you know, again, the commonalities that we have, you also have a podcast, right? And so one of my best friends, Daniel Song, says, Mick, everybody should have a podcast. I don't agree with that. I think everybody should be a part of a podcast, right? 
[P41]  Tell your story. Definitely makes sense. What made you and Alexa, what made you guys start your podcast? Like, what was day one? Like, I want to start a podcast because. What was that? So we talked a lot about different mentors. I wanted to provide my audience with the people, the guests, the tools, the skills that help them become successful. And I wanted to provide that knowledge to our audience base. 
[P42]  what I've learned and the connections I make and the relationships that I've cultivated. And I know some really amazing people, so it's great to be able to interview them and then have them share their wisdom. And my hope is that my audience can listen to the podcast and take an actionable step towards making their life become better. And then I also think it has to do with, I was always terrified of public speaking growing up. And I know that in order to overcome anything, you have to put yourself through it. 
[P43]  So this was also something that wasn't easy for me. And the more that you practice, the more that you interview people or interview, it's going to build up that muscle and that confidence. So I would definitely say those are the two main reasons why we started our podcast. And what's been the most amazing thing since you've been in the podcast journey? Like if you were to go back and say, wow, without the podcast, this probably wouldn't have happened. What would that be? So many things I've been invited to. 
[P44]  before we recorded the podcast, I was invited to Trent Shelton's birthday because I had him as a guest on my podcast. I was invited to Secret Knock where I got to meet so many incredible people. And so you never know what opportunities can come from opening up, putting yourself out there and starting something. And I know that if I've never started this, it would have been constantly on my mind. And I don't want to go through life thinking, what if? What if I started that? 
[P45]  And so it's just been amazing the people that I'm able to meet in their relationships, I think is the biggest piece that I was able to cultivate. And I mean, everyone we brought on is just so smart in their different ways. And it's just fascinating to be able to connect with everyone. Love it. I love it. And I know the power of the podcast and all the things that can come along with it. And now you're working on an e-book, right? So tell us a little bit about this e-book.

主题：导师与指导的重要性

输入内容：
[P33]  the power of mentors and mentorship. And I think a lot of time people's either they don't know how to seek advice, guidance, help, or their ego gets in the way, right? So how important has mentorship been for you in shaping who you are? It's been everything. I mean, I think the most valuable asset is yourself and investing in you. I know a lot of people take their money and invest it in cars and outside circumstances and things. 
[P34]  you bring yourself everywhere you go. So I'm constantly seeking mentors to help me what I went through and to understand that, like I mentioned before, it doesn't have to define me. And the knowledge that they know and for them to get where they are, it's just, it's incredible. And so I seek mentors all the time. I know that you're also mentoring us too. And I mentioned this previously, but you need to find someone who's been where you are and who has what you want. 
[P35]  And I think it's really important because mentors need to know the struggles that you've gone through and really understand it on a deep level. And I find a lot of times people can't go as deep with anyone else as they've been with themselves. So I think a lot of mentors that I look up to that I seek have done the inner work who have, they've came through so many challenges and struggles and adversities. And that's what I really look for in a mentor. 
[P36]  I'm seeking them out. Totally agree. Like a hundred percent agree. And for me too, it's all about rounding myself out, right? Like, and that's why I believe in having multiple mentors and multiple coaches because everybody's not great at everything, but a lot of people have done that one thing really well, that one skill really well, or a couple skills really well. And so for me, that's what I seek. So if it's like, if this part of my life or this part of my journey, I can't figure out, or I haven't figured out, or I know I want help with, I go find either a coach or a mentor. 
[P37]  that has that thing, right? And because if there's anything, and I talk to Les Brown every day, if there's anything that he told me that like truly opened my eyes, it's this. It's not about experience. It's about wisdom because you can experience losing. You can experience going through a rut. It's wisdom that is like, hey, you don't want to do this or you might want to do it this way or go over here, right? And people talk about the journey of climbing steps and Les was like, yeah, that's great. 
[P38]  hey, you should know how to climb steps, but if there's an elevator, take the elevator, right? Like that's the difference. Like, and we're not talking about not knowing how to take the steps. I think you have to know how to take the steps as a part of your journey, but you don't need to prove every day that you can take steps, right? Like sometimes when there's an elevator, take the elevator because you know where you're going. And to me, that's what mentorship is about. It's about knowing the difference between I need to take steps so I'm learning versus, yeah, I know what I'm doing. I just want to get there. 
[P39]  faster or I want to get there without having to make these mistakes. And to me, that's what mentorship is about. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. And Tony Robbins says this a lot, too. He said, great mentors compress decades of learning into days for you. So like you mentioned, if you want to learn a specific skill set, go to that expert in that. And that's going to expedite your process and what you're doing so much faster. And it's either you're taking the time to learn it or you're paying money to learn that skill a lot

I knew that. So your favorite sport, is it still gymnastics? I love gymnastics, yes. And now I don't practice gymnastics, but I love doing hot vinyasa yoga 
[P57]  allows for deep stretching, very similar poses to gymnastics as well. And it just cleanses my body to doing the hot power yoga. See, I'm learning a lot about you that I didn't already know.

Oh, this is a hard one. We've had a lot of amazing ones. Obviously, you were incredible. I can't wait for your episode to launch. Okay. Hasn't launched yet, but I would say Garen Jones. I don't know if you've ever heard of him, but his story is absolutely incredible. He was able to change his life around, and he's 
[P59]  such an incredible husband and father. And I love the impact that he's making on the world. I would say he would probably be my favorite interview. All right. I like it. And then if you could go listen to two speakers at any conference in the world, who would those two speakers be? Ed Milet. I love him.

主题：领导者情商缺失问题

输入内容：
[P23]  network marketing about five years ago. Amazing. So, you know, I've known you for a while. I just learned something new about you that we have in common, too. So I have a master's in leadership. So my focus was organizational leadership. And then I had another focus of executive leadership. So, you know, leadership is my jam. So I'm going to ask you, where do you see leaders failing the most today? I think it comes down to actually this conversation earlier in our meeting, emotional intelligence and being able to regulate your emotional 
[P24]  I find so many people let outside circumstances and validation and what people think about them and what people say about them define their character and who they are. But you have to realize that you have complete control over your emotional state. And you can say, am I going to let that define me? Am I going to let that upset me? Or am I going to rise above it and not have to take that into account and hold firm to your values and who you are? 
[P25]  to be able to bring me down or make me feel upset because I hold that power to resist that. So I really do feel like it comes. You don't want your highs to get too high and your lows to get too low. You want to have that even keel because I actually watched a video about this. If you're a leader and people are looking up to you, your emotional state is they're called neuro neurons. So they're feeling that energy too. And they start to cultivate that from within. So I think that is one of the most important things in leadership. 
[P26]  And I think a lot of people are failing with that today. I do see that a lot. So we agree, which is why we're besties, right? Like without even having this conversation offline, and we have so many conversations, like we're in so much alignment there because to me, emotional intelligence for leaders, and I would even say society too, like that's the biggest drawback that I see with most people. We don't have to have immediate response. We don't have to have immediate gratification on things. Like sometimes we need to reflect before we respond. 
[P27]  How does this affect the greater scenario versus the right now scenario? And to me, that's where emotional intelligence definitely comes into play. So that's kind of cool, Samantha. We have that in common. Yeah, I can agree more with you. Let's talk about some of the other things that you do. All these other business ventures, I'm going to say that you have, right? Because Samantha tries to get me to eat healthy and I see what she eats. I'm like, Samantha, I can't. No parasite cleanse for you, Mick. It scares me. Not going to lie.

主题：电子书创作与幸福感悟

输入内容：
[P46]  go. It's my second ebook. It's called Creating Happiness from Within. So Alexa and I published it together. And I think a lot of it was realizing that people seek happiness outside of themselves. And I think that's a lot of times what society teaches us, you know, that promotion, that bonus, that car, the watches, all of these things that are fleeting in the moment, but don't actually give you self-fulfillment because then you're always looking for something 
[P47]  else. And so I find a lot of times our guests are truly happy within. And so it's taking the knowledge that they taught us and sharing it. And so it was a great journey writing that with her. So let's take that a little bit further for the listener, the viewer that's like, Samantha, that sounds awesome. But how do I find happiness within? What are some tips and tricks that you can give that person right now that's like, sounds great, but I'm at a place right now where 
[P48]  I can't even get to where I can see the happiness. I love that question. So I think the biggest thing for me was picking up a meditation routine because a lot of times I feel like people are so focused on the past or the present and meditation puts you in the present moment and it makes you feel grateful for what you have. And so I combine that meditation with my gratitude practice because how can you expect God in the universe to give you more 
[P49]  and thankful for what you do have. And so that has been pivotal in my life. I actually created and published a journal. It's called the Dream Bigger Journal. And so every single day, I'm writing down at least three things I'm grateful for. And it starts your day on such a positive note. And when you're in gratitude, your vibrational frequency is raised tremendously. And you start attracting more positive things in your life. So I would definitely say that. 
[P50]  helped me is keeping the promises I make to myself. If I say I'm going to wake up and go to the gym at 6 a.m., I am showing up for myself because it's a reflection outside of you too. If you have that self-trust from within, other people are going to start trusting you. And that's a really good feeling because you're creating that from within and not seeking anything externally. I love it. You're amazing, Samantha. Thank you. You're amazing. So you ready to go rapid fire with Samantha Lampeters?
