[P1] ﻿ The world is absolutely crazy right now. This is one of the most interesting moments of social, cultural and economic transition that I have ever seen. So I wanted to do something that I've never done before. I called upon three of the leading voices on social, cultural, business and economic issues to give their unfiltered, uncensored points of view so that we can all make sense of all of this craziness happening before our eyes. They don't always agree on much, but today they thrash it out to see if they can agree on something. 
[P2]  Go through the economy, Trump, Elon Musk, EEI, censorship, wokeism, and why so many men are struggling. Why are tens of thousands of millionaires running away from the UK? The terrifying truth and opportunity in AI. And I ask all of them, what is the most important thing in 2025 that nobody is talking about? With the aim of reaching clarity, agreement, and having a laugh in the process. This is the episode you probably didn't know you needed. 
[P3]  When we look at the back end of Spotify and Apple and our audio channels, the majority of people that watch this podcast haven't yet hit the follow button or the subscribe button, wherever you're listening to this. I would like to make a deal with you. If you could do me a huge favour and hit that subscribe button, I will work tirelessly from now until forever to make the show better and better and better and better. I can't tell you how much it helps when you hit that subscribe button. The show gets bigger, which means we can expand the production, bring in all the guests you want to see and continue to doing this thing we love. If you could do me that small favour and hit the follow button, 
[P4]  wherever you're listening to this, that would mean the world to me. That is the only favour I will ever ask you. Thank you so much for your time. Back to this episode. You guys are three of the best commentators, the most articulate people I know that also have the most interesting, broad experience and also I think political background. So I wanted to talk to you about everything that's going on in the world. And I wanted to ask you guys some of the dumb questions that I ponder alone with myself and with my dumb friends in my WhatsApp group. 
[P5]  It feels to me that the world is at a real moment of transition in many regards. So like social transition, cultural transition, economic transition. And I think the US has been a catalyst for all of that. So that's why I wanted to have this conversation today. We've got an American here, Scott. I think Scott's the only American here. We've got Constantine. We've got Daniel, who are two Brits, but spend a lot of time between America as well. And so I want to come to Scott first and ask Scott a question, which is a very big, broad question, 
[P6]  your perspective, Scott, you know, when I talk about this feeling of transition, that seems to be like almost inside my chest, that we're at a really historic moment. What is your analysis on this? What is the big picture here? What's happened over the last three, four, five, six, seven months? And how is that going to impact all of us around the world? Well, if you think of the US as setting the tone economically, and maybe even culturally for the West, there's definitely a reversion away from 
[P7]  people feel that quote-unquote wokeism, and I don't like to use that word, but I'll use it here, was this sort of overcorrection to systemic racism and that it began to cause more damage than it was or cause more problems than it was solving. And I think there's been a serious kind of lurch back, if you will, whether it's executive actions declaring the border, a state of emergency, stuff around saying that gender is a thing, 
[P8]  and female. And most of these issues, the actually American public supports, I would say on a more cynical level, America used to be a platform for prosperity, the protection of civil rights, the projection of women's rights and power and democracy abroad. And I would argue that it feels like a pretty quick transition to almost like a, you know, I call it a kleptocracy, but America has become a platform for 
[P9]  acquiring wealth and then leveraging that wealth as a means or a proxy of power. And the ultimate example of that was the launch of two meme coins, the Trump coin and the Melania coin, the day before the presidency, such that this conversation could have already or might happen this week. And I'll finish here. President Trump, it's Vlad. We're thinking about stabilizing our currency or trying to send the outflows of our reserves. 
[P10]  into the Trump coin, which, based on my economist estimation, would take the value of it to a $20 or $30 billion market cap, making you one of the wealthiest men in the world, Mr. Trump. And none of this would be disclosable or transparent. Also, in unrelated news, we'd really appreciate you seizing arms shipments to Ukraine. So I think we've gone kind of full kleptocracy is the way I would describe it. Are you optimistic, Scott? Well, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. 
[P11]  I don't know if I'm just getting older, but no, I don't see a man convicted of sexual abuse or found liable who inspired an insurrection retaking the White House as a point of light for the American experience. Constantine, I suspect you'd have a slightly different view on all of the above. How are you feeling about everything that happened yesterday? Did you watch the inauguration? What is your big picture, 30,000 feet view? 
[P12]  make bold predictions about what's going to happen over the next six to seven months. I do think what America had at the election and what the election of Donald Trump represents is something that we in the UK don't have, which is choice. They had a very clear choice between two very different perspectives on the world, between two very different approaches, between two very different candidates. And ultimately, criticisms of President Trump are necessary and legitimate. Of course they are. 
[P13]  But at the end of the day, I believe having spent quite a lot of time in America around election time and also just generally and traveling around real America, not just in D.C. and L.A. and New York. The reason that he was elected was that the American people are not prepared to accept what Europeans have decided they're prepared to accept, which is managed decline. The American people do not want their country to become weaker. They do not want it to become poorer. 
[P14]  impoverish their fellow citizens through net zero. What they want is their country to be great, their country to be powerful, their country to be influential. The economic realities for most Americans are not really reflected in the figures that we are told. So when people talk about inflation, the reality of people's lives on the ground is that their cost of living has gone up very, very significantly over the last few years. 
[P15]  overall inflation figure that we're shown because certain things are much more influential in people's lives than others. And so whether the decision to elect President Trump ends up being this positive thing for which there should be lots of optimism is a matter of the next four years. Are we going to see a presidency that really does everything it promises? And by the way, you know, if you look at the things that Donald Trump is promising, 
[P16]  Whether you're left or right, you have to acknowledge that they are things that are worth doing. Having a secure border so that people don't come into your country illegally is a basic duty of government. Economic prosperity is a basic duty of government. Withdrawing America from a kind of simultaneously aggressive but weak posture around the world where America sort of says, yeah, yeah, we're going to get involved in these foreign conflicts, 
[P17]  win that war is a kind of stupid position on both whichever side you're on. So on all of these things, and of course, you know, Scott mentioned wokeness. I think he's absolutely right that there is a massive backlash happening around the world because lots and lots of people who were completely apolitical until the last three or four years or maybe until 2016 just feel like the world has gone crazy and suddenly they're supposed to pretend that men can change sex and become women and now they're 
[P18]  entitled to be in female prisons. And, you know, if your teenager says that they are the opposite sex, you're supposed to chop their breasts off and all of this other stuff that ordinary people just look at and go, this is crazy. Like, I am liberal, but this isn't liberal. This is some kind of weird thing that's going on. And I see the backlash against all of that all over the Western world. And I think Donald Trump signifies that people are fed up of that. 
[P19]  that if the woke left continues to exercise this level of influence on our public debate, the reaction will be the rise of the right. And Donald Trump is one of the most diplomatic and pleasant versions of what you're likely to get if the left keeps going crazy. We will see what challenges the world throws at him over the next four years and whether he's capable of responding to them. 
[P20]  left lost its way in your view? And if so, how did that happen? And just to respond on some of Constantine's points about Trump being the best of a sort of right-wing collective, are we going to see right-wing sort of ideology spread throughout the Western world over the coming years? What's your take on all of the above? You definitely, you know, we Democrats, we get it right and then we just go too damn far. And so I look at, I'm a professor on a campus, 
[P21]  DEI, 60 years ago, there were 12 black people at Princeton, Yale, and Harvard combined. That was a problem. Race-based affirmative action makes sense. This year, more than half of Harvard's freshman class identifies as non-white. But 70% of those non-whites come from dual-income homes in the upper quintile of income-earning homes. The academic gap between black and white used to be double what it was between rich and poor. It's now flipped. So DEI was a good idea that, quite frankly, has gone insane 
[P22]  system it was trying to do away with. And then we created two candidates who were the only candidates who could make each other viable. Vice President Harris, given the hand she dealt with, did the best she did. I think President Biden should be buried in a crypt entitled narcissist who decided that it made sense for him to go back on his pledge to be a transition candidate and gave us a British-style election timing on the Democratic side in a marketplace. 
[P23]  or you need time and money. So it was not, we did not have a great candidate. There is an understandable swing back from what is an overcorrection around some of these issues. You know, parents, we gave them a huge issue with transgender rights. There's more Padel players in California than transgender people. And yet the Democrats decided to conflate it with the civil rights movement and think that it was okay for a woman who transitioned, a transgender woman, 
[P24]  enter a bicycle race and finish five minutes before everybody else, and then we all bark up the same tree and decide that it's inspiring. And parents all over the nation are saying, we've literally gone crazy. Where I would disagree a little bit with Constantine is that America choosing economic growth and prosperity, there are 190 sovereign nations in the world. 189 would change places with America over the last four years. We hit 71 new record highs in the markets, 97% of all AI. We've created more market capitalization 
[P25]  in a seven-mile radius of SFO International Airport than Europe's created in the last 20 years. We have the lowest inflation in the G7. We have the highest growth. We've grown 10% since 2020. That's triple the rate of Europe. Biden was unable to communicate any of that effectively because there's this psychological dynamic that when your wages go up, you credit your own grit and character, and when the price of cereal goes up, you blame the president. Now, similar to the future, or how William Gibson described the future, 
[P26]  It's here. It's just not evenly distributed. Prosperity is unprecedented in the U.S. over the last four years. It just wasn't evenly distributed. Now, having said that, in America, you can stop working in August and you've produced more and made more money than you have in Europe the whole year. And it has gotten better. It says things are less bad than anywhere in the world in the U.S. Biden was unable to communicate it. And then talking about how great the economy is when rents were skyrocketing, tuition was going up, it was an ineffective strategy. 
[P27]  But I don't think it's fair to say Americans chose prosperity. We have prosperity. 
[P28]  My favorite appointment in the Trump administration in the adult room is the 10 year bond, which is going to say, sorry, girlfriend, when I believe the president tries to implement some of these economic policies. Constantine, is that true? Because what I heard there is that effectively Trump had a better marketing campaign. And that reality is somewhat different from what the Americans were sold in the last election cycle. Well, politics is about marketing and Trump is the marketer in chief. 
[P29]  and partly that's what politics is about. But in terms of the economy, I think Scott is entirely right. It's one of the reasons I admire America so much, the sense of dynamism and economic growth and the desire to create things and build things. It's an observation I've had every time I've been there. You know, if you have a successful restaurant in the UK, you go, well, I've got a successful restaurant. In America, if you have a successful restaurant, you open a second one and a third one and you create a chain, right? So their attitude to business more broadly is, 
[P30]  is fantastic and I love it. But I think the difference is that I don't think Americans were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the European economies. They were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the American economy under Donald Trump in his first term and also what they expect him to do for the future. When they look at the fact that he's got real business leaders in government now, like Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk talking about government efficiency, 
[P31]  all Western countries have a massively bloated civil service, what we call civil service in the UK and the administrative state in the US that wastes a huge amount of money, that produces very little in terms of output in many cases. And that needs to be slimmed down. And people, I think, are very excited about that. And when I talk to business leaders in America, including ones that were never on the Trump train, so to speak, so many of them went over to his side in this election cycle. 
[P32]  because they just felt that he was going to continue to accelerate American growth and continue to deliver prosperity for the American people. Now, Scott's point about tariffs and all of these other things, you know, I've listened to Donald Trump enough now to know that you should not necessarily be taking him literally. I think many of the things he says are negotiation tactics and signaling. 
[P33]  build this or do that or do this. You have to sort of read between the lines when he says, you know, this will be the worst thing that you just go. He's saying to people like, you better work with me. Otherwise, this is going to work out badly for you on all of these things. And so it remains to be seen whether he's successful in those tactics of getting what he wants. Look, America is always going to be an unequal society. It's designed in a way that is going to make it that way. In America, the focus is how do we grow the pie? 
[P34]  In Europe, the focus is how do we divide it up so everyone gets their fair little share, right? So Americans are about expanding the pie and then the people who bake the pie get as much of it as they possibly can. But the question is, can there be a sense in America that the American dream is alive, that you do not have to work three gig economy jobs to pay your rent, that you're going to be able to buy a house, that you're going to be able to afford to have children, 
[P35]  raise a family, perhaps on a single income, something that most people only dream about nowadays. That's really what this whole economic conversation is about. And we will see over the next four years if Donald Trump is able to slightly even change the direction of travel towards those things that actually Americans of my generation and older used to take for granted as the promise of the country that they live in. I've thought a lot about this over the last couple of weeks in particular, 
[P36]  papers in the UK that millionaires are leaving the UK in historic numbers. I think it's 10,800 millionaires left last year, which is an increase of about 160% versus the previous year. And the general sentiment in terms of business confidence in the UK is at a several year low. So I think it's the lowest it's been since just post pandemic. There's this, I think it's the Institute of Accountants, they call up 1000 accountants every year, and they get they run a survey to see how much confidence 
[P37]  they have in business in this country. And it's fallen 14 points to 0.2% confidence in terms of business. But there's this bigger narrative emerging amongst my entrepreneurial friends that if you want to start a business right now, the best place to be in the world is to be in America, is to get over to America and to leave the UK. Now, Dan, how does that score? I know you have an accelerator, you speak to lots of entrepreneurs. How does that sort of compare or contrast with what you're seeing at the moment? Yeah, 100%. The value proposition for the UK has dropped through the floor. 
[P38]  Very, very high tax. The ecosystem of business is in decline. Some of the smartest people are now in Dubai. Some incredible creators that I know have moved to Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai. Many are going to the USA. So if people are interested in bigger markets and bigger opportunities, they're into the USA. If they're interested in lower tax and more fringe opportunities, they're in the Middle East. 
[P39]  a place in the world. I think there are three business models the UK could go for, which is either the head office of Europe, which is what we were when we were inside the EU, and everyone used to come here to build a European business. We could be the back office of the USA, so the incubator for the USA. A lot of smart companies get to their first 50 million of value here in the UK and then sell to a US private equity firm or US listed company. 
[P40]  And a lot of US companies are now actually coming here to poach talent or to outsource things to the UK more cheaply than they could do it in the US. The wages in the UK are through the floor compared to what you would pay in the US, especially in tech roles. So very smart people in the UK are massively devalued. 
[P41]  tax, model of Dubai, Singapore, you know, those kind of options. So we haven't really picked one of those three yet. We're still, you know, all these years after Brexit, and we haven't said which of those three models we want to adopt. Scott, you moved here a couple of years ago to the UK. And despite everything that's going on in the UK, are you still bullish on this being a place for entrepreneurship and business? I was looking at some stats 
[P42]  of key areas of concern for me. Business stats I've talked about there, the drop in business confidence, the entrepreneur exodus that we're seeing, but things like knife crime in the UK are up 81% over the last decade, which I think is a symptom probably of something else. And one of the big things I think a lot about as an entrepreneur at the moment is artificial intelligence. And our investment in artificial intelligence from a global perspective is down about 2000% versus a country like America. So you've moved here, you've brought your family here. 
[P43]  bullish on the UK versus the US from an entrepreneur's perspective? So the question I get most frequently when I speak here is to compare and contrast the US with the UK. And I use a personal anecdote. My parents immigrated to the US from Glasgow and London when they were 19 and 22. They took enormous risks. I've been an entrepreneur my whole life. I like to think that a lot of my success isn't my fault, that I inherited sort of that risk-taking DNA. And when I speak to people in the UK, I say the primary difference is 
[P44]  And that is, it kind of comes down to a risk appetite. The U.S. has five times per capita the number of entrepreneurs. It has five times the dollar volume per startup. There's $5 million in venture capital waiting to be deployed for every startup in the U.S. versus $1 million in Europe. I love what Constantine said about a restaurant. I went into this great little restaurant in Soho a few weeks ago called Dig In, and I loved it so much. I left my card and said, can you have the owner? 
[P45]  I'd like to open another one. Does he need money? I just would never do that here. I thought that was a really interesting insight. And the collision of risk, crazy ideas that occasionally become crazy genius and technology and intellectual property and great universities results in a company that no one had heard of five years ago being worth more than the entire UK stock market, NVIDIA. So there's just an enormous difference. 
[P46]  my impression of the UK economy, I'll just say London. I have no experience in it. I don't go anywhere that's not walking distance from Marlebone. So my bubble is pretty opaque. But the way I would describe the economy here is I love the term the butler economy. And that is all the money I see being made here is people servicing wealth created somewhere else. You're either in financial services servicing rich people. You're either opening a restaurant or hospitality. 
[P47]  quality servicing rich people, but I don't see a lot of organic wealth creation. I interviewed the two, quote unquote, inventors of AI at one of your prestigious universities. My first question is, how the hell were you not able to make any money if you invented AI? Why haven't you been able to capture any money? But just for your listeners, my summation of Europe versus the US after molesting the earth for the last 35 years is US is still the best place to make money and Europe is still the best place to spend it. Is this a failing nation, Scott? 
[P48]  I think you have too much going for you to be described as a failing nation. You still have amazing universities. London's still the second best city in the world. Premier League, it's an unbelievable export. I know how ridiculous that sounds. People want to be here. There's still rule of law, rule of play. You still produce amazing rock and roll. I just don't see how you could say this is a failed. I would argue that second only to our entry into Iraq, 
[P49]  An American can't understand why you would decide to increase your prices while reducing productivity in one fell swoop. It's difficult for us to wrap our heads around some of the economic decisions the UK has made. But I think a lot of people are kind of betting or hoping that the UK begins to grow again. So in a weird way, I would call myself cautiously optimistic about the UK. I think at some point it registers. 
[P50]  it begins to occupy the place it should command, if you will. Constantine, I would ask the same question to you as well. Do you think the UK is a failing nation? And Scott describes self-inflicted wounds there. I've heard you speak of self-inflicted wounds when you talk more broadly about the West and what the West needs to do to turn itself around. And also just layering a third point on top of that, which is somewhat linked to this, is Elon Musk has taken a particular interest in the UK over the last month in particular. 
[P51]  started to describe it online, it seems, as a failing nation. What's your view? Well, I'm glad you asked me about Elon Musk, because the thing that I love most about the media having this massive meltdown about, oh, no, these Americans are interfering in our political... These are the same media commentators who are constantly banging on about American politics and saying, Donald Trump needs to do this, you need to vote for this. Like, all of this stuff is ridiculous. The reality is we download our culture, our politics, 
[P52]  almost everything from America, right? America has become what Britain used to be, which is the center of Western civilization. And my request and ask and begging of British people is, if we're going to download American culture and politics, let's at least take the good stuff instead of all this terrible woke shit that we downloaded from them, the DEI and all this other nonsense, and actually take the entrepreneurial spirit and all these other things that are really great about America, the optimism, 
[P53]  the positivity, the willingness to have a go, to take a risk, as Scott was talking about. So I wish we took more of that. And it speaks to your question about are we a failing nation? Look, I think it's a deliberately inflammatory question, which I don't want to kind of actually accept in that way. But what I think we should acknowledge is are we trending up or are we trending down? And when you talk about over 10,000 millionaires, 
[P54]  have left. I hear that through a normal British person's ear. And I worry that there's quite a lot of British people who will hear that and say, oh, good, all of these rich parasites have left. Because that's our attitude in the UK to a very large extent. We see wealthy people not as what they are, which is for the most part, not everybody, but for the most part, people who've created a tremendous amount of value for their fellow human beings. And as a result of that, 
[P55]  have been rewarded. We see them because we, you know, we have this history of the landed gentry. And so to us, a millionaire is someone who has these ill-gotten gains that they don't deserve, right? That is not really the world we live in. When I talk to wealthy people in this country and pretty much everywhere else, for the most part, especially in the Western world, these are people who've created something that has fundamentally helped other human beings do something better, do something easier, 
[P56]  products, cheaper, whatever it is. That's who the successful people really are. And we just need an attitude shift. That's what we should be downloading from America. What we should be saying inside our heads is this person is successful because they've helped other people. Great. How do we get more of those people into our country? And I'm afraid I'm telling you something that you know better than anyone, Stephen. If you don't have entrepreneurs in your country creating businesses and creating jobs, 
[P57]  eternity. We have to get smart, talented, driven people into our country instead of chasing them out. Dan, I know this is a subject that you're very passionate about, and Konstantin's articulated it really, really well. I've seen lots of your posts about this subject, Dan. What are you seeing? And is it true that the British attitude is a form of self-harm that's holding us back from our potential? There are definitely attitudinal factors, but you'll also get the most incredibly entrepreneurial people here in London. London is a melting pot for 
[P58]  creativity. You've got sitting in one city, you've got people who are phenomenal at media, finance, technology, entertainment, politics, defense, like all of this. Like if you take the best of LA and Washington and New York and Miami and kind of start moving it into one city, you know, you get elements of that in London. It's a very diverse city from that point of view, and it creates an entrepreneurial melting pot. The issue is taxes. Nobody wants to pay 
[P59]  60% of their income in taxes. And as soon as you hit, you know, in the US, you don't hit the top tax rate until you are six times the average wage. Here in the UK, it's two and a half times. So as soon as you're two and a half times the average wage, you're in real trouble. There are so many people in the UK who deliberately hold their income at £50,000 because after £50,000, you get taxed 40% of your income. So people just give up and they say, I'm not going, I know some 
[P60]  really smart, really talented people who could be earning a lot more and they refuse to pay the 40% rate. So they like keep everything small because they don't want to go from 20 to 40% at the 50 grand rate, which is crazy. And I've employed people who have said, can I have a day off a week rather than going over that threshold? So, you know, that's a huge issue, the tax issue. The company rate tax is high. The corporate capital gains rate is taxed very high. The VAT is high. 
[P61]  The council tax is high. All of these additional taxes just keep piling up. And then the other cost at the moment, if we want to have an AI economy, we need cheap electricity. One thing that Trump has committed to is really, really cheap energy. There is no such thing as a fast growth, high octane economy that has expensive energy. Cheap energy equals fast growth. And we have the most expensive energy in the world. 
[P62]  Scott, you look like a lot of thoughts are going through your head following those two comments. What are you thinking? 
[P63]  that we have a housing crisis and that the executive order should have been around that. Just going back to the U.S., and I'm curious of the same dynamics and whether Constantine and Daniel agree with us. I believe this, the election in the U.S. was supposed to be a referendum on women's rights. Women's rights did not show up. This was a referendum on young men, in my view. And that is, if you look at the two cohorts that swung most from blue to red versus 2020, two of the three cohorts, other than Latinos, 
[P64]  was people under the age of 30 who in the U.S. are 24% less wealthy than they were 40 years ago, people over the age of 70 or 72% wealthier. Our tax code is basically an attempt to shove money from the young to the old. And two, 45 to 64-year-old women who I would affectionately describe as their mother. And that is when your son's in the basement vaping and playing video games, and I think a lot about struggling young men, you don't give a flying fuck about territorial sovereignty in the Ukraine, or Ukraine, excuse me, or transgender rights. 
[P65]  is your kid isn't doing well. And 210 times a day, your kid's getting a notification that somebody he knows is on a Gulfstream or partying in St. Bart's and it's not him or her. And so we not only have young people not doing as well, this pornographic wealth is just shoved in their face. And you end up with, in my opinion, kind of a young, struggling young man. No group has fallen further faster in the world, I would argue, than young men in America. 
[P66]  a morgue in the United States and there's five people who died by suicide, four of them are men. One in three men under the age of 30 has a girlfriend. Two in three women under the age of 30 has a boyfriend. Why? You think that's mathematically impossible? Because women are dating older because they want more economically and emotionally viable men. There's one in five men live at home at the age of 30. One in three under the age of 25. They're not having sex. They're more obese. They're more depressed. When women don't have a relationship, they oftentimes channel that energy 
[P67]  into their professional lives. More single women own homes in the U.S. than single men. Women in urban areas under the age of 30 are making more money than men. When men don't have the guardrails of a relationship or a job or being in school, they pour that energy sometimes into unproductive things, misogyny, nationalism or extreme nationalism, conspiracy theory. In some, they become really shitty citizens. They become sequestered from society. So I'm worried in the U.S., our biggest threat is a new species of asexual. 
[P68]  asocial young men who are incredibly dangerous have opted out of America. 60% of 30-year-olds used to have one child in America, and that's 27%. So people, I think, in the U.S., and this is a genuine question. I don't know if it's the same problem here. Our tax policies have taken money from the young, stuffed them in the pockets of old people so Nana and Pop-Pop can upgrade from Carnival to Crystal Cruises. Meanwhile, young people can't afford education. They can't afford housing. 
[P69]  And we especially see this really acute emerging crisis among young men who are just opting out of America, who don't even want to try and date, don't even want to enroll in school, don't want to even try and get a job, just stick in their basements and go on Reddit or Discord, or why go try and shower or work out and get a relationship when you have you porn? Why get a job when you can trade stocks or crypto on Coinbase or Robinhood? 
[P70]  In my opinion, this is the most dangerous trend in America right now. It was almost like demonizing men for decades has consequences. I mean, this is what's been happening. Men are the root of all evil, the root of all evil, the root of all evil. Every advert is about, you know, the woman is strong and capable. The guy's pathetic. In every movie, the woman's kicking ass and the man is pathetic. This has been going on for decades. It's a cultural thing as well as an economic thing. 
[P71]  meaning and opportunity away from men. If you create an education system that punishes boys for being boys, if you create a society in which traditional masculine virtues become vices, then you will create exactly the sort of thing that Scott is talking about. It's a terrible thing that's been done. Having said that, my message is always the same to young men who I hope are listening, which is the answer to your problems is never going to be, as Scott says, porn and this and that. 
[P72]  the answer to your problems is going to take responsibility, go out and get a job or create a business and actually make your life better. No one's coming to save you. No one's coming to help you. There is no, the sort of programs that we have for women where we sort of go, well, you know, let's give them an opportunity here. None of that's happening for men. It's not going to happen because for evolutionary reasons, we just don't feel sorry for men the way that we do for women. That's a reality. I know it sucks, 
[P73]  men is going to be the answer that's always been the answer for men, which is for you to get off the sofa, to get off the couch and go out and actually do and create and build and find your own way through it. Even if you have to acknowledge that the society you live in has been conditioned for quite a long time to think that you're a piece of shit because you happen to have the genitalia that you do. Now, that I think is the harsh reality of it. And I think Scott is right to point this out as a problem. And I hope that we start to have 
[P74]  both in terms of economic policy, but in terms of also just the cultural conversations and the way we talk about these issues, we come back to something that human beings have known through the entire history of our species, which is men and women are both good and need to work together in order to thrive and succeed together, in order to have families, in order to have children, and in order for us to have healthy communities and healthy societies. You need healthy femininity and you need healthy masculinity, and they need to come together and work together. 
[P75]  Together, that's what we're supposed to do. And these stupid gender wars and this idea that men as a group are this and women as a group are that, all of that just needs to end. I was watching last night as Trump sat there signing all of those executive orders. And I also watched his inauguration speak where he said, we will forge a society that is colourblind and merit-based. And he signed a bunch of executive orders last night to eliminate a variety of different DEI programmes in the federal government, 
[P76]  We've seen 
[P77]  whack DEI measures. So I think there's a lot of nuance here. I would argue in universities, DEI is used as a giant misdirect from people such as myself who are enforcers of the caste system and wake up every morning and look in the mirror and ask ourselves the same question. How do I increase my compensation while decreasing my accountability? And what I found is the ultimate strategy is to create an LVMH rejectionist bullshit, elitist strategy, where Dartmouth sits on a 
[P78]  endowment of $8 billion and lets in 500 kids. So the conversation around who gets in is a misdirect from the important question that is how many. If you are not growing your endowment or your freshman class faster than population, you should lose your tax-free status. We should be letting in more gay kids, more trans kids, more white Republicans from rural state. You know who doesn't talk about DEI? Junior colleges, because there's no admissions. They don't have a problem with DEI. 
[P79]  own tail, started out with the right idea. Now it's nothing. And I would argue the same is somewhat true of the Democratic Party. I went to the Democratic National Convention. On the dnc.org website, it lists 17 special introscripts, and it says explicitly who we serve, Asian Pacific Islanders, seniors, veterans, Black Americans, the disabled. It basically lists, I added this up, 76% of the population. And when you say you're actively advocating for 76% 
[P80]  of the population. You're not advocating for 76% of the population. You're discriminating against the 24%. It's gone too far. I would argue in the workplace, having served on seven public company boards, and I'm going to do a lot of boasting here because I'm desperate for all of your affirmation, and 12 private company boards, there's still work to be done in the private sector. There still is a cycle. 40% of all venture capitalists and probably 70% or 80% of all venture capital deployed 
[P81]  are white guys from just two universities, Stanford and Harvard. So I would argue universities, it's gotten out of control. I'd love to see the DEI apparatus disassembled, along with the ethics department, the sustainability department, the leadership department. These are all bullshit where we hire formerly important people with no standards. They never get fired. It just translates to more student debt. In the boardroom, in corporations, in certain sectors, I do think there is a need to be thoughtful about broadening the aperture of the lens 
[P82]  people who are underrepresented. There's still a dearth of women raising venture capital. So I think it's nuanced based on sector. But to just say all DEI is bad, I want to move to where the University of California did in 1997. They don't have race-based affirmative action. They have adversity-based affirmative action. I'm a beneficiary of affirmative action. I had something called Pell Grants. I was raised by a single immigrant mother who lived and died as secretary. So I got grants. I had 
[P83]  unfair advantage because I came from a household that was low income. And I think that there should be affirmative action. And I think it should be based on color, but that color is green. The poor need our help. The moment you start advocating for a special advantage based on any external factors, I think at this point in our society, it probably causes more problems than it solves. That's exactly right. That's exactly right, Stephen. 
[P84]  take a step back and look at why DEI has become such a big part of the conversation, it's precisely because instead of addressing the reality of people's lives, which is some people are disadvantaged and some people are advantaged, actually what we've mainly done, and Scott alluded to at the very beginning of our discussion, is we've given a leg up to very wealthy ethnic minority people from successful families, and they now, their children now get into 
[P85]  prestigious universities, which they probably would have done anyway, some of them, because they come from very advanced backgrounds. And the kids that are growing up in poverty, black and white, have no shot whatsoever. But the reason that it's become such a big issue around the Western world, actually, I don't think it's the nuances that we've delved into here, but actually something else, which is we have created the most ethnically diverse societies in history. And what I mean by that is, 
[P86]  not that we've created societies in which there are large groups of people who are different from each other, but for the first time probably in human history, we've created societies in which there is a lot of ethnic diversity and there is no overt discrimination against some groups of people in the sense of, you know, the imperial societies in the past would have had one dominant ethnic group, which is, you know, the Russians in the Soviet Union or the Turks in the Ottoman Empire 
[P87]  in the British Empire, whatever. That was the ethnic group that was like the dominant one. And everybody else was a kind of second-class citizen and everybody knew it, right? We don't have that anymore. We have highly diverse societies where people of every single background exist in which we have this idea that we're all supposed to be equal. And when we have programs that explicitly discriminate against people, there were times when the discrimination was explicit 
[P88]  black people. Well, we've gone full circle now where the discrimination was going the other way in university admissions, in hiring, in corporate America, in government, in all sorts of things. You know, in this country, the BBC has internships that aren't available to white people, etc. When you get to that point, as Scott said earlier on, everyone just goes, look, I know I'm not supposed to say this, but the reality is this is racism. This is a form of racism. And I thought we were trying to get away from the 
[P89]  So to the extent that the elimination of DEI is about creating a merit-based society in which people are given an opportunity because they're skilled and talented and they have the potential to actually achieve things and create wealth. You know, we all know this. We all employ people, right? How many of us are thinking about the races of the people we hire? I don't think we think about that at all. What we're thinking about is I run a business. I need the very best personable. 
[P90]  very best possible person for this job at the price I'm willing to pay. I don't care if they are purple, green, blue, white, whatever. It doesn't matter. What matters is, are we getting the best person for the job? And my concern about identity politics has always been that if we do not adopt that worldview, then what we will do is create a worldview in which we have different racial groups competing with each other on the basis of race. 
[P91]  very dangerous mix for a multi-ethnic society like ours, which is why I've been begging people to let go of this stupid idea of identity politics and to say, first and foremost, we are all Brits or we are all Americans. We have this umbrella identity under which we all operate and our personal ethnicity or sex or whatever is secondary to that and actually for the purposes of employment, for the purposes of college admission, et cetera, is irrelevant. 
[P92]  Yes, if there is disadvantage, if we grew up in a single-parent home with a low income, we may need some extra support there. If we had terrible schooling or our education was not good, we may need extra support. If there's certain things that make it easier for us because of the disadvantages we've had to fulfill our talent and potential, I am all for that. But what we've created so far, and that's why I'm delighted it's being eliminated, is an anti-meritocratic system which says, 
[P93]  We don't care what you bring to the workplace. We don't care whether you deserve this place or not. We don't care about the potential you have. Actually, we just needed an insert category tick box to fill this slot. And you filled it. It doesn't really matter that you're not doing your job very well because now we can say, you know, we're a diverse company. I don't care about that and we shouldn't care about that as a society. And thank God that's now gone. Yeah, I think the worst part about it too is that it calls into question 
[P94]  and they're from a diverse background, you know, it calls into question why they got that job in the first place, which I think is horrible. You know, I just hired from two candidates, the final two candidates was a guy and a woman. I would hate if the woman felt that she got the job because she's a woman and not because she's best. She turns out she was by far the best in the process. And I would love for her to know that there was absolutely nothing that changed our view. 
[P95]  We weren't trying to fill a position with a woman. We were trying to fill the position with the best, and she should know she was the best. I think the contrast that was really fascinating was between Trump's website and the Democrats' website. So in the Democrats' website, it was who we're for, which was what Scott was saying. But Trump's website was the 20 things we're going to do, and it was just a list of 20. These are the 20 action points. This is what we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this. 
[P96]  as opposed to the identities that we want to advantage list. And I think that was the choice. You know, at the beginning, Constantine, you said, you know, America had a choice. And for me, when I looked at those two websites, I saw this choice between the identities being the main thing or the to-do list being the main thing and very different approaches. Scott, when I was listening to that Zuckerberg interview talking about masculinity and identity issues, one of the lines he said in there, 
[P97]  like something you've said on my show before, where he said, I think having a culture that celebrates that aggression a little bit more, talking about masculinity, has its own merits that are really positive. Now, Mark Zuckerberg isn't necessarily someone that I saw closely aligning to your worldview. Am I right in thinking that that's something you agree with? Because I remember you saying to me, you think people should be able to walk in a room and kick everyone's ass. What I've said on your show is that I think the male form, especially under the age of 30, 
[P98]  with its bone structure, incredible double-twitch muscle, and then this amazing, amazing chemical called testosterone, you're going to look back at your 25-year-old self and think, why wasn't I a fucking monster like Steve Barley? And also, there is some masculinity when Russian soldiers pour over the border in Ukraine. You want some of that big dick energy that Daniel was talking about. In the case of Zuckerberg, 
[P99]  I don't think he really understands an aspirational view of masculinity. I think when he couches immediately kind of trying to kiss Trump's ass because Trump threatened to put him in prison, and what he used to call moderation, he's now calling censorship. And when you have an algorithm that elevates incendiary hateful content, I would not describe that as masculinity. For me, masculinity comes down to protection, providing, and procreation. 
[P100]  Iадib Axel- He's about gendering a workplace in the context of trying to excuse a total elimination of what I would think is probably healthy moderation. I imagine Daniel and Constantine might have a different view. 
[P101]  Right now, when I talk about masculinity, you know, there's if I say at a conference, oh, women are better managers. Everyone goes, yes, that's right. That's right. Right. That's OK. If I say men are more risk aggressive and make better entrepreneurs, you're a misogynist. You're out. And the reality is men and women bring different attributes. But the masculinity and femininity, I think masculinity is a wonderful thing. I think we need a different image of it. I think people born as male have an easier time leaning into those things. 
[P102]  I work out at CrossFit with a bunch of lesbian firefighters. They bring great masculine energy, and they could carry my ass out of a fire. So a lot of men demonstrate wonderful feminine qualities. A lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculine qualities. I don't think these things are sequestered to anyone born as a specific gender. What I think, when I talk about masculinity, I don't talk about it in the role of corporations. I think that's as fraught with risk and not worth talking about. It should be about shareholder value or stakeholder value. 
[P103]  I think young men need a code. We're going to church less. We have fewer relationships. So what's the code you hold on to in terms of creating behaviors that are productive for you, yourself, society? And I think masculinity needs to be redefined as something more aspirational where you're celebrated for being really fucking strong. You're celebrated for not complaining. You're celebrated for creating surplus value. You create more tax revenue than you absorb. You're celebrated for being aggressive. You're celebrated for breaking up fights at bars. 
[P104]  not starting them. You're celebrated for protecting your country, not shitposting it. You're celebrated for approaching strange women and expressing romantic interest. That's not a crime. And if she's not interested and you're rejected, you're both going to be fine. You're celebrated for getting out of the house. You're celebrated for working. You're celebrated for making money and liking money. I think there just needs to be a redefinition of masculinity in the context of helping young men 
[P105]  code that they used to get from the armed services or from dual parent households. And I feel like they're struggling. So I like the idea of something that they feel in their bones and in their body and in their DNA that they can lean into that we celebrate. And the conversation is flipped entirely. Five years ago, I was called a misogynist for talking about masculinity. Now the conversation is being led and advocated by one group, and it's mothers who are like, 
[P106]  My son is not doing well. I got three kids, two daughters, daughters in PR with the other ones at Penn, and my son is in the basement vaping and playing video games. He needs something to latch on to. He needs a code. Anyways, but I apologize. Word salad. Zuckerberg and masculinity, give me a fucking break. He looks like a Chechen Molly dealer. Sorry, back to you, Stephen. Well, it's interesting when you speak, Scott, because your views on masculinity 
[P107]  me to be most better represented by the right side of politics than the left side of politics. They both have their own vision of masculinity. And yours seems to be a Republican view of masculinity. To Trump's credit, he saw the opportunity and he flew right into the manosphere. Rockets, crypto, Joe Rogan, Theo Vaughn. He said, no, I'm not going to run from this. I'm going to fly right into it. Now, I would argue that his vision of masculinity has too much 
[P108]  coarseness, too much cruelty, too much bullying. I don't think that's masculinity. I think when we talk about Elon Musk taking risks, sending rockets that are captured by scissors coming down, inspiring the EV race, taking an enormous risk, making a shit ton of money. Yeah, that's a great form of masculinity. Accusing men trying to save high soccer players, calling them pedophiles, calling your employees a sex criminal such that they have to leave their house, having 13 kids by five women or three women, none of which you live with, 
[P109]  Sleeping next to a loaded gun, losing control of your self-control because of addiction. I don't think that's a great role model. I think it's an amazing role model for boys. I don't think it's a great role model for men. In terms of energy, there are so many reasons why I'm a big matcha fan, if you don't already know by now. And so much so that I actually invested in the UK's leading matcha company called Perfect Ted. And one of my favorite Perfect Ted products is these delicious matcha pouches that come in every flavor from salted caramel, 
[P110]  to peach flavor, to mint flavor, to berry flavor. One of my favorites is this vanilla flavor, which I'm going to make in just two seconds. You just take this mixer here, get a little bit of the powder, pop it on top of the shaker like that. Put the lid on. Shake, shake, shake. Delicious. If you haven't tried this yet, you can find Perfect Ted at Tesco and Holland Barrett stores or online where you can get 40% off with my code, Diary40. 
[P111]  put in code Diary40 to try this delicious multi-flavored matcha now. Highly recommend. And if you do it, please tag me, send me a message online. Do you know that 80% of New Year's resolutions fail by February? It's because we focus too much on the end goal and we forget the small daily actions that actually move us forward. Those actions that are easy to do are also easy not to do in life. It's easy to save a dollar, so it's also easy not to. Making one small improvement each day, one tiny step in the right direction, has a big difference over time. 
[P112]  mindset, which is why we created The 1% Diary, a 90-day journal designed to help you stay consistent and focus on the small wins and make real progress over time. It also gives you access to The 1% Community, a space where you can stay accountable, motivated, inspired, along with many others on the same journey. We launched The 1% Diary in November and it sold out. So now we're doing a second drop. Head to thediary.com to grab yours before it sells out again. I'll put the link below. 
[P113]  Censorship. The word censorship was used there by Scott. We've seen this reversal in Meta's attitude, Facebook's attitude that had been built up over a decade, where it almost felt like if you had sort of right-leaning views or really any unaccepted views and you posted those on Facebook, you would face maybe having the post deleted or your account suspended. This new world of speech, of free speech, and as it pertains to masculinity. 
[P114]  noticed, Scott, you'd left X. You no longer post or tweet on X anymore. Do you think Elon's decision to buy X is a net positive for society? Net, yes. But I think what people hear when you say that is there's no problems with this system than, you know, compared to the ones we had before. There are definitely disadvantages to a free platform like X now. And one of them is 
[P115]  inevitably when you remove censorship, one of the things the censorship was doing was keeping all the deeply unpleasant people away from being able to shove things in your face. And that happens quite a lot on it. So I don't enjoy that aspect of it. But I've always said that would be the price that we would pay for freedom. Freedom always has a price, and that's what we're seeing. As for Zuckerberg, his miraculous transformation into a free speech warrior 
[P116]  And I'm delighted to welcome him. I'm sure it's entirely genuine and not anything to do with the election results we've just seen in any way whatsoever. And the fact that the culture shifted and those of us who were being censored by people like him for years actually winning the argument. Well, what it shows you is we've won the argument on free speech when it comes to the big tech platforms. And it's going to be messy. 
[P117]  that are algorithmically driven, where the truth and the moderate reasonable take is not what usually gets attention, you're going to see a lot of unpleasantness. I value the ability to hear and communicate truthful ideas and facts over my own subjective feelings. Oh, someone said a thing I don't like or someone was racist or someone was misogynistic. I don't enjoy the fact that that happens. 
[P118]  but I would rather that happened and also we were not being censored from saying, you know, COVID probably came from a lab in China, which we were. You know, the Hunter Biden laptop story isn't Russian disinformation. Actually, it's an important piece of information that American voters need to hear when they're making their decision about the election. And all of these other things that were being suppressed and censored across social media for years, they're not anymore. 
[P119]  that's a good thing. And I think that's helpful. And if you look at, you know, to bring it back to the UK for a moment, Stephen, as you know, on Trigonometry, we've tried to cover the grooming gangs scandal and is an outrage what happened in this country over decades. We've been covering that for years, since about 2019, 2020, to very little purchase. And one of the reasons is it was just something that the media sort of covered and then moved on, when it actually should have been something we talked about on 
[P120]  daily basis until serious action was taken. And we saw real, real change, real change in policing, real change in social work, real change in government, real change in the way that these racially aggravated hate crimes were treated. Well, none of that was really being talked about seriously until Elon kicked up a fuss, amplified the voices of survivors, amplified the voices of campaigners on X, which he bought. And now the British government is forced 
[P121]  to do whatever it can to actually address those issues to the extent that it will. A lot of people will say it still doesn't go far enough. Well, if it doesn't go far enough, we now have a platform from which we can continue to have that conversation until there is the sort of inquiry and the sort of outcomes that people want to actually deliver real change. So is that a positive? God, yes. God, yes. We needed that. 
[P122]  by someone like Elon Musk on a platform like X, which is now free, to the point where Keir Starmer is forced into defensive action. I wish that was around 30 years ago because a hell of a lot of young girls and women wouldn't have suffered the way they did if we had the opportunity to get that message out. So, God, yes, it's a net positive. Just to pick up on that, Constantine, I've had a question in my mind for a while regarding the scandal, which is horrific, I think it's something we all definitely agree on, is why has Elon chosen 
[P123]  now? And why has he chosen Keir Starmer as the sort of central target of this flurry of tweets around the grooming scandals? Because there's clearly, Elon's, I think, an individual which you can kind of see thinking in real time. Like if you go back through his tweets, because there's so many of them, and they kind of come in these spurts, you can almost see what he's getting at. Is there an underlying reason why he's made this a central issue over the last couple of weeks? 
[P124]  is actually most Americans were completely unaware of this issue until recently. I remember a year ago speaking at a private event in New York and somebody said to me, well, you know, what is the consequence of political correctness? Why are you so against it? Why are you so against censorship? And I talked about the grooming gangs and people were horrified. They hadn't even, and these are well-informed, educated people who are media savvy and whatever. So one of the reasons is I think to a lot of Americans, this issue is only coming to the fore. 
[P125]  now in front of their mind. The second issue, I think, is that Elon Musk understands what I said earlier, which is we have a global Western culture now. And so what happens in Britain matters just as much as what happens in America, because we are symbiotic with each other now. When there's a restriction of speech in the UK, when we have laws about what people are not allowed to say, that has an impact across the world. When you see the European Union trying to pass legislation, 
[P126]  about online censorship. That has an impact because if something exists in the UK and in many European countries, it's only a matter of time before people in America are going to say, well, look, they've got this in Europe. Why don't we bring it over here? And vice versa. So what happens in America affects us in Europe and in the UK. And what happens in Europe and the UK affects America. So what Elon, I think, is trying to do is to say, we care about our civilization. Elon doesn't really talk that much about the United States. 
[P127]  about our civilization as I do, because I believe that we are now one thing to a very significant extent. Now, from our civilizational point of view, is it a good thing that mass rape gangs in the UK are being insufficiently investigated and treated improperly by the police and the government? No, it's not. It's a very bad thing. So how do we address that? Well, we address that by putting pressure on the government of the day. Now, I don't see the grooming gangs as a party political issue. 
[P128]  it properly, although there were individual members of the cabinet that tried to do something like Sir Le Braverman. But he's putting pressure on the government of the day. You can see him going after Nigel Farage, of all people, and saying Nigel Farage is not the right leader for reform. So he's attempting to shape British politics in the direction that he feels is the right way. What does he want? What outcome does he want? Look, I don't know what Elon Musk wants. I don't know him personally. I haven't even yet had a chance 
[P129]  to interview him, which I really look forward to doing, because I think he's one of the great visionaries of our time. Whether you like him or not, I think that's undeniably true. But my sense is he's trying to talk about all the things that we've been discussing, freedom of expression, the end of identity politics and the pursuit of meritocracy, a pioneering, inspiring vision of the future, which is why he's talking about Mars and a vision for our civilization that goes beyond the narrow squabbling 
[P130]  here on Earth. And the understanding that human beings are meant, we left the cave. We're not supposed to stay in a place with the walls closing in on us and feel like we're in decline. We're not supposed to be a civilization that has 1.5 children per woman and that is simply just leaving the planet Earth because we can't reproduce. We're supposed to look at the future with hope and optimism. We're supposed to say, 
[P131]  I want things to be better for my children. I want to have children. I want the vision of our society being one of positivity and optimism and a sense of a pioneering vision and inspiration. That's what I think he wants. And I don't really see any of that in the current government in the UK. And I think he's right to go after them and say, you are destroying your country's economy. You're destroying its culture. You're destroying its sense of cohesiveness by allowing illegal immigration. 
[P132]  You are destroying that sense of optimism and vision. And you're not saying to people, let's build something better. You're saying, let's stay small. Let's play small. Let's not rise above our station. And I think we need people like that, imperfect as they may be in all sorts of different ways, to drive our civilization forward, to say to us, there is an inspiring vision to which we're all moving, as opposed to just sitting there and waiting to die, which is what we've been doing for far too long. 
[P133]  I think Elon is taking him at his word. You know, he said a year ago that he was going to absolutely dismantle the woke mind virus globally and he was going to ensure meritocracy and free speech. And when he sets his mind on something, he has the ability to stay focused on it for a very long time to a degree most people can't fathom. You know, and he's absolutely willing to endure pain. He loves a fight. He obviously has the kind of mind that can't relax unless he's kind of grinding up against some gear. 
[P134]  as well. Like the way he works needs stress in his life. He needs a big enemy. He needs a big fight to engage with. And I think Keir Starmer just ticked all of his boxes as someone to go up against. I think what's interesting is we talk about these big tech. I love that Scott has previously talked about breaking up big tech. And I think there's potential for that in the next four years. All of these guys like Trump and JD Vance and all of them have locked horns with big tech. 
[P135]  and they've come, you know, this is their chance to get revenge on big tech in the next four years. They could do a little, you know, you might see Google have to, you know, spin off YouTube or you might see AWS have to come away from Amazon or something like that. Who knows? But it's interesting that a lot of these big tech guys, they're probably cozying up to Trump because, you know, that could be on the cards as well. There's been a lot of Trump butt kissing over the last couple of weeks. 
[P136]  bragged about the fact that everybody's flown down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss his butt and to cozy up with him. And there's now headlines saying that there's this tech oligarchy forming in the United States where Bezos and Elon and Zuck are all now friends and they're stood behind Trump as this unifying force. Just to touch on a few points of that, but also on Constantine's message that Elon is doing this for the betterment of humanity, to further humanity, his involvement with the UK, but his broader involvement in politics now. Scott, does that square with how you think about Elon? 
[P137]  And I am quite curious to ask you why you made the decision to leave X and to go to Blue Sky and Threads and things like that. Yeah, I can't speculate on what motivates Elon Musk. I quite frankly just don't get the guy. And I don't have the domain expertise to comment on the rape gangs. It's such a serious, upsetting issue. I don't know it well enough to speak intelligently to it. Just the topic of censorship, though, as it relates to meta, 
[P138]  A hallmark of a free society and a democracy is that pretty much anyone can say pretty much anything about pretty much anybody. I believe that. The question is, do machines and bots have free speech rights? Because if I say something, I believe, and I may be paranoid, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong. I believe VCs whose portfolio companies I've said have overvalued have enlisted thousands of bots to basically just shitpost me over and over on X to diminish my credibility. 
[P139]  critical of Putin that the GRU has hired troll farms to create lists of thousands of people to weaponize bots to say disparaging things about them. Do those bots have free speech rights? In addition, when Fox News distributes information to its anchors saying Dominion voting machines were weaponized by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, despite the fact they knew that was not true, but they tell their broadcasters to do it anyways. And then Dominion says, this hurt our business. 
[P140]  and you knew it was false, and you decided to communicate it anyways, courts find them liable. They have to pay three quarters of a billion dollars. What happened at Fox News was a dumpster fire compared to the nuclear mushroom cloud on Meta. So a lot of what we're talking about here, if you want to say that mRNA vaccines alter your DNA, I think you should have the right to say that. The dissenter's voice is important because occasionally the conspiracy theorist ends up being correct. 
[P141]  is, when you have a business model that elevates the most incendiary, ugly content beyond its organic reach, should you then be exonerated from all liability and slander that traditional media companies are liable to? If we were to say that Elon Musk is a pedophile and start stating facts and evidence of it, and he could show that it's hurt his ability to raise money for Tesla, and he filed legal action against this podcast, 
[P142]  I think we would be in a world of hurt, and that legal liability is warranted. But the most powerful media companies in the world have Section 230 protection, so they have a business model where conspiracy theory or novel content, which is Latin for bullshit and lies, and the more angry it is, it gets elevated beyond its organic reach. So while I'm kind of down with the notion that we should have free speech and anybody should be able to say pretty much whatever they want, 
[P143]  There's something wrong when we have algorithms that have a profit incentive around rage, conspiracy theory, and lies, and two-thirds of Republicans believe that the election was stolen, when one in five Americans think that 9-11 was an inside job. Let's be honest. They thought that before the internet. I remember watching all the 9-11 truth of movies and all of that. But your point overall is right. I totally agree. 
[P144]  Wait, Elon agrees with you. When he bought X, he talked about the bot problem. He talked about the amplification of outrage. He hasn't done as much as I hoped he would have done so far, but I hope that they do address that because that isn't an Elon or an X problem. It's a technology problem of the modern world. The reality is that the more we live our lives online, the more you're going to have the problem of the ability of foreign governments, of individual people to create fake accounts, 
[P145]  bot farms, et cetera, to influence the way we look at all of these things. And we are going to have to come to terms with that reality because it's a technological issue that we're going to have to solve for and we haven't yet. It's also very easy for people to get caught in their own bubbles as well, which is a new phenomenon. There was a time where if you believed crazy things, you still had to sit next to someone else in church and talk to them about their life and what they believe. And you encountered dissenting voices. 
[P146]  encountered sane, rational people who had very different views to you that you had to be friends with long term. Whereas where we are right now is if you've got some sort of crazy view, you can find yourself only talking to people who share those views and only sharing content that reinforces those views until such time that you become extremely radicalized. I think that's such an important point because I think it's a real shame that AI LLMs aren't crawling the real world. I was at Granger's yesterday. Someone comes up to me. 
[P147]  Love your content. Let's take a picture. They're so nice. Another person comes up to me and says, I disagree with your view on this, but we have a civil conversation. And then I come home to 40 bots telling me I'm Professor Genocide. I mean, people in the real world, generally speaking, I don't know if it's because of the threat of physical violence, or they want to have sex with you, or maybe they think at some point you'll hire their kid, or generally just a comity of man. But people in real life, I find, are just lovely and wonderful. And it's a shame that these LLMs aren't calling this. 
[P148]  because the treif and some of the vile shit they're crawling online, which I don't even think reflects our species. I think it reflects technology that has a profit motive around promoting the most incendiary, hateful content. So there's got to be some sort of medium speed here. And also, I got off X, Steve, because you don't like Chick-fil-A, don't eat a Chick-fil-A. If Musk wants to pay $44 billion and turn it into a Nazi porn bar, that's his right. 
[P149]  illegal. I don't think the government should step in. But I don't have to paint his fence. And I can go to another platform. That's my right, too. And everyone says, oh, you're against free speech. I'm like, no, I'm not. I'm against being on a platform that makes me feel bad. So he has the right. And all this notion around meta, free speech, it's a little different because they control so much of the media. But these are media companies, and they should be liable for slander or defamation, the same way traditional media companies are in 
[P150]  I think we could solve a lot of this problem by just removing 230 protections for algorithmically elevated content. If you decide to elevate content beyond its organic reach, then you are making an editorial decision and you should be liable if that, in fact, is slanderous or defamatory. I think that's really fascinating as a way of handling it. And also, we're living in a world where, as of this year, some of the most phenomenal content you will read will be algorithmic. 
[P151]  generated and some of the most compelling content. So this idea that Scott's talking about, should bots have free speech? It sounds like a kind of, you know, intellectual kind of pseudo intellectual topic, but it's absolutely a very practical topic in the sense that bots now can generate conversations very easily. And some of the, you know, you could spend all day talking to a bot and not know. It's funny, this is this subject has come up because in the last week, I've had a flurry of messages on 
[P152]  WhatsApp from friends. I actually had two tweets yesterday, which you could probably see if you just search my name. Because on X at the moment, there's multiple ads running that are fake articles with fake BBC headlines with my face in. So it says things like, the Bank of England is suing Steve Bartlett. And this is running as a sponsored ad on X. And people are tweeting me these things. My friend says every time he refreshes the feed, he sees a new sponsored ad of a fake article of me. And sometimes it's like, can't believe this happened to Steve. And it's a BBC article. 
[P153]  you click on it, you get scammed. I think it's a crypto scam. I don't want to click. I'll send the link to you guys so you can click on it for me. But I just, it really has, because that is a bot. There's multiple of them, multiple accounts that have been spun up. They're all verified accounts. And it's AI generated imagery with a paid ad behind it. That's the bit that really gets me. I get people can post shit, but sponsoring it is a new level of defamation. One of the big macro things I've been thinking a lot about 
[P154]  haven't shared yet, is just the amount of social networks that have emerged. In the last 10 years, there's been a 50% increase so far in new social networks that have emerged. And we're seeing this splintering now of the rumbles, the blue skies, the threads. And it almost seems, talking about echo chambers, that social networks are becoming sort of political environments. And you're choosing your social network now based on your politics. This doesn't seem like a net positive thing for society. 
[P155]  argumentation of our reality. And it comes, you know, Scott's point about people behaving better in person is true. Although I would say there is the windscreen effect or the windshield effect, which is if someone cuts you up in traffic and you feel that there's some kind of physical separation between the two of you, most people behave slightly differently in that context than they would if they were sitting next to somebody face to face in a bar. So there's something about being physically present with other people that changes it, 
[P156]  one of the reasons, you know, I know you have pretty much all your interviews face to face and we do as well, because I generally speaking, it's very difficult to connect authentically with people. Obviously, we've managed to do it in the course of this conversation, but beyond that, it's difficult. And so we're going to have to work on that. But I just what the point I'm trying to make is this isn't a political issue. It's not an X issue. It's not an Elon Musk issue. It's a technological issue. We're living through 
[P157]  probably already have lived through most of the digital revolution. And I used to, as a kid, love Isaac Asimov science fiction books. And one of the reasons I did enjoy reading them so much is it was a world in which there was an exploration of what does the creation of robots, which is what we're living through, mean for morality? What does it mean for philosophy? What does it mean for humanity? What does it mean for, how do we build rules in a world 
[P158]  in which you have these machines that take every rule literally and suddenly you find that, you know, the desire to protect humanity results in the end of humanity. How do you navigate all of this? And that is what we're living through. We are also living through a period when our realities are being fragmented. And so we believe a very small set of things that other people like us somewhere in a very different part of the world, as Daniel was saying earlier, 
[P159]  believe, and we now live in this, we don't live in England or in Scotland or in America. We live almost like in a world of people who think like us in the West. And then other people live right next door to us who live in a whole different world because they consume a whole different set of information. That is the reality. We can complain about it. That is not going to change. And the only thing I really want to, 
[P160]  raise where I disagree with Scott about this idea that Facebook and X, et cetera, they are publishers and not platforms. I don't think you can apply the same media organization section to them. I don't think it's appropriate. They are platforms in which people publish information. The artificial amplification is a fair point. We need to deal with that. We need to deal with the bot problem. 
[P161]  That's a very difficult one because one of the challenges is the only way to really deal that I can see with the bot problem is to get people to verify their identity online. That obviously has a lot of questions around that because once you start forcing people to give their identity over to some anonymous blob online, who's collecting that data? What are they doing with it? 
[P162]  then the question for you is, well, you know, let's say right now I look at Twitter and I'm like, yeah, I'm happy to verify my identity. I'm happy to confirm who I am. Well, what if, you know, George Soros buys X off Elon at some point? Are you still happy that that information is being held? Are you still happy that the anonymous account you've now made confirmed? You know, what happens to the anonymous activists speaking about the Ayatollah's regime in Iran? 
[P163]  identity and the wrong person buys that platform or someone hacks it, et cetera. So it's a conversation that's not, if there were easier solutions on these issues, they would have been solved by now. This is a very difficult thing for humanity to navigate, and we're going to have to find a way to do it, and incrementally so. I just want to respond to that. I think you're guilty of the same illusion of complexity that protects these companies from acting like actors such that they can do anything regardless of the damage to the commonwealth to add shareholder value. 
[P164]  If you implemented, we have, first off, this notion that you don't want to give up your identity. Trust me, they know everything about you, Constantine, already. And I could go get a ton of information on you from the dark web fairly easily with a credit card. So the notion that somehow we shouldn't have some sort of, you could have, we need age verification for social media. There's no reason anyone in the age of 16 should be on a social media platform. And regarding the, 
[P165]  the civil rights activist or the women's rights activist that needs an anonymity, you could create a number of accounts and use blockchain or some sort of third-party anonymous to have a certain number of accounts that says, look, if you want an anonymous parody account, you want to make fun of people, fine. If you want an account talking about issues that you feel are sensitive from other markets, fine. We could absolutely figure that out and then figure out, okay, this account is doing nothing. It has no base. It has no soul. 
[P166]  values. It has 72 followers. All it's doing is trying to start fights online. All it's doing is trying to make people feel shitty about Britain or shitty about America. And the reality is these companies use that illusion of complexity such that they can have more bots creating more fake clicks, more Nissan ads, and more shareholder value. I think there's a middle ground here. I think we could figure this out. I agree. Well, that's what I'm saying. I think some of the ideas that you're putting forward, right or wrong, I don't know. 
[P167]  conversations we should be having. How do we make sure? I mean, my son is two and a half years old. And if my wife has become a complete screen Nazi, so he's probably not going to get a phone until he's about 40. But I think your point about people shouldn't be on social media. People shouldn't be on social media until they're 16. Absolutely correct. What that's doing to the minds of, well, or everybody, but particularly young people who are really susceptible to it. 
[P168]  The verification dimension is difficult, as I say. We're going to have to hash this all out as humanity. We're just going to have to work this all out. How do we live in this new world that we now live in? It's going to take some time. And I hope it's not as bad as the last time the information space was revolutionized, which was the printing press. That caused about two centuries of religious war. Hopefully we can avoid that. And part of the way to do that is to create environments which are uncensored, 
[P169]  People can express different ideas. We can have these battles and eventually come to some sort of mutual understanding. I hope that happens. What I wanted to ask you all to really close out this conversation was these conversations tend to be a bit of a reflection of what's in the news cycle and what's in the news cycle tends to be a reflection of what people are clicking. And a lot of that's driven by fear and the sort of narrative of the time, whether it's immigration or the Trump inauguration. But what is the big important idea that we're not talking about? 
[P170]  what's the most important thing that we should be talking about that isn't getting enough attention right now as it relates to the future of the West? And that's a big, broad question. I'll start with you, Daniel. For me, it's the schooling system. I think the schooling system is not preparing people for a world that exists and that we're teaching. You know, we haven't grasped the fact that AI is going to be the biggest, most disruptive technology in the lives of our children 
[P171]  into probably won't exist. We need to have a radical look at this idea that children should go to school with the same age groups or study a certain set of topics or that it should be topic-based at all. We need to explore, you know, are there better models for the schooling system that prepare people for the world that we're going to be in? Our current schooling system goes back to the early 1800s. 
[P172]  military schooling system in Prussia. And that's kind of where it evolved from. I think what we need to do is think about what are the, you know, what are the skills that our kids are going to need? I see too. And I can only, I don't feel like I can wrap my arms around UK's issues, but in terms of the US political extremism, I would put it number two, you know, at negative 40 Celsius and Fahrenheit meet. And because of our electoral system and Citizens United, people from the far left who are crazy and people from the 
[P173]  right who are crazy are just overrepresented. And they come together to meet on reckless spending, deficit spending. They come together to agree on anti-Semitism. And there's just too many people on the far left and the far right. And the people in the middle, it's minority rule. They're just not represented. However, I think the biggest threat that people aren't talking about, and I've actually spent some time talking with the administration around this, or the former administration, I should say, is loneliness. And that is, you have the deepest pocketed, most well-resourced 
[P174]  companies and people in the world trying to convince people, especially young men, that they can have a reasonable facsimile of life on a screen with an algorithm. And I think they literally go crazy. I think they wake up and they're obese and lonely and have no skills. We talked about this. I think young people, I say this jokingly, but seriously, I think young people need to get out of the house more, drink more, make a series of bad decisions that might pay off. I think we need more sex. I think we need more people in third spaces. 
[P175]  more church, more religious, more institutions, national service. We're mammals. And I worry that we're, one in seven men doesn't have a single friend. One in four men can't name a best friend. So this loneliness epidemic where people get into a bubble and start engaging in conspiracy theory, not trusting each other, blaming women, blaming the nation, self-harm. I just, I worry about, you know, when I say to young men, I coach a lot of young men, 
[P176]  15 minutes for a reason. This shit is hard and it's worth it. But I worry that we're raising, like I said, this new species of asocial, asexual being called the young American male that is obese, anxious, and just a shitty citizen. Constantine, the most important thing in 2025 that's not getting enough attention? In the UK and in most of Europe, it's an issue that Daniel raised earlier, which is in the UK, our energy prices are four times what they are in the United States. 
[P177]  That is an ideological decision. It's done because we're saving the planet. That's what we're being told. The reality is our contribution to global carbon emissions is we're responsible for 2% of global carbon emissions in the world. Making British pensioners freeze to death every winter because they can't afford fuel bills is not the solution to climate change. And if you amplify that further, 
[P178]  making our economy uncompetitive, making Britain unable to generate wealth for itself and for its future is not the moral position. Net zero, which is the impoverishment of our society for ideological reasons, has been positioned as the moral cause where we're saving the planet, we're ending climate change. We're not doing any of that. All we're doing is virtue signaling and making our fellow citizens suffer. So what we should be talking about is how do we make energy cheap, again, 
[P179]  so that we can have a prosperous economy. And guess what? When people are prosperous, that's when they actually start being responsible about pollution, about throwing away things they don't need. And also, when you have money, that's when you can invest money in scientific research, which allows you to find cleaner, better forms of energy. That's what we should be doing. We should be making sure that we generate as much wealth for our fellow citizens as possible, because a lot of people are struggling. 
[P180]  deeply, deeply immoral to impoverish already poor pensioners in this country and to prevent businesses from hiring people and giving them jobs and opportunities, including the young men that Scott is talking about, because we are saving the planet and we're trying to keep little Greta happy. We're not doing any of that. We're not successful in that. We should stop pretending and we should do what Donald Trump said he plans to do, which is drill baby drill. We should be exploring and exploiting all the energy reserves 
[P181]  this country in order to create clean energy and better forms of energy for the future, as well as to improve the well-being of our fellow citizens. That's what we should be talking about a hell of a lot more than we are. You need cheap energy. You're right. It's what I would argue. I think it's going to be liquid, natural gas and nuclear. We haven't talked about AI. AI requires 10 times the energy. The AI query is a Google query. The choke point is energy. I would argue in the US, I think we'd benefit more from as opposed 
[P182]  The drill, baby, drill, build, baby, build. I think young people have seen housing prices just go crazy. There's a psychological benefit to household formation, forced savings. So I'm going to take your word because you're a very smart guy that Britain has implemented a series of policies. That energy stat you rolled out was incredible. But in the U.S., like I said, I don't want to say we're drowning in oil. There were more drilling permits issued under Biden. 
[P183]  than the previous Trump admitted. I mean, just to call Biden anti-energy or that somehow we have this massively overinflated energy prices, it's just not, that hasn't happened in the US. I would like, we need more homes in the US. And in the UK too. And Stephen, let me just, before you wrap up, fill the stats out a little bit more. Obviously, everyone understands that geopolitically we're in a pretty tense time and there's conflicts happening. 
[P184]  Britain is in a position now where we would struggle. You've got to remember British history. Britain is, Britannia rules the waves, right? The way that Britain has become a great nation throughout history is by having a powerful fleet. We would struggle to build warships now because we've closed down all our steelworks because we're green, right? It's insanity. And on every other issue to do with energy and industry, we have basically deliberately moved our production 
[P185]  facilities to other countries. Okay, great idea. Globalization, make things cheaper, ship things, but wonderful. Okay, what happened during COVID? What happened when suddenly the entire chains of production weren't quite operating the way that they normally do? Oh, China's suddenly hoarding all the masks. Interesting. So what do you think is going to happen when there's a war? Or they're just going to keep shipping the steel to us to make the battleships and the warplanes that we need to fight them? That's what you think is going to happen? This whole thing, this whole agenda is ideological, 
[P186]  And what Ed Miliband is about to do to this country when it comes to this issue needs to talk about way more. And it is about economic prosperity. It is about housing, because one of the reasons we don't build as much housing as we need to is, again, building housing produces emissions. And we don't want to be not green. So that's why people in their 30s and 40s are now living in flat shares for four people. We have got to let go of this obsession with net zero. We have got to build. We have got to drill. 
[P187]  We have got to produce energy and we have got to stop thinking that the moral thing to do is to make our poor citizens suffer in order that we feel good about saving the planet, which we're not even remotely saving by doing this. Guys, thank you so much for all of your perspective. One of the things I realised as you guys were talking is that you're all fathers and you're all fathers of boys, although you're fathers of boys at different ages. So I wanted to just give you all 30 seconds if you could. 
[P188]  self for this advice but based on everything that's happening in the world which can feel incredibly confusing especially to young people where we're getting a lot of our information from different echo chambers what is the advice that you would all give to your young boys that would best prepare them for the future in the next couple of years starting with you Dan yeah so I've got a six-year-old daughter a seven-year-old son and a 
[P189]  them for a world that's fast changing is difficult. We're taking the approach of a lot of general knowledge across a lot of things so that you can use AI to run deep in different topics. We're encouraging the kids to interact with supervised AI conversations and letting them know that that technology is available. We're also just focusing on some manual skills, like how to fix a boiler and how to saw through some wood. 
[P190]  you know, those kind of things. And also we're doing things like acting classes, being up on a stage and performing. So all of those kind of typical things. But to be honest, it is a point of anxiety in my life just thinking about what, you know, what the world looks like for, you know, 10 or 15 years from now that they're going to be going into. So if you get clear answers on this, I'm really open to learning. 
[P191]  For me, my son is two and a half, so it's a little bit early for this pep talk. But my message to him when he's old enough to hear it is going to be this. Your grandfather, your great-grandfather, my grandfather, was taken as a slave laborer from Soviet Ukraine to Nazi Germany. Your great-grandfather was born, your great-grandmother, rather, was born in the Soviet Gulag. Your great-grandmother lived through the German occupation 
[P192]  Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. You are not living in the worst time ever. You're surrounded by pussies. If you are a man and if you do your job and if you learn the skills that you need to do and if you pursue the things that you want to do with your life to the best of your ability, if you believe in yourself, if you believe that you're talented, if you actually achieve the things that you set your mind to, there's never been a better time in the history of humanity than now. You're surrounded mostly by people who feel sorry for themselves, 
[P193]  If you're not one of them, you're going to clean up. Young women are looking for a young man like you who's actually going to stand up for himself, who's actually going to go out there and achieve and be confident. Be that and you're going to clean up when it comes to finding the right partner for yourself. You're going to clean up when it comes to making money. You're going to clean up when it comes to your career. You're going to clean up on every front because the bar has never been lower. The bar has never been lower. So just go out and be a man and life is going to be great. 
[P194]  I'm older. I have 14 and 17 year old boys. And my observation is you can't tell them anything. The best you can do is you can try and model behavior for them. So I'm trying to be really kind to their mother. I'm trying to show them that, you know, if you're serious about having a good family, you got to be a generous, loving partner. I'm trying to be in great physical shape, which is getting harder and harder. I'm trying to be aggressive around them in terms of business. 
[P195]  business and trying to be kind. And what I do, I do talk to them about the concept of surplus value. I'm like, you're takers right now. You know, the UK school system, which is amazing, is investing a lot in you and you're giving almost nothing back. Me and your mother are loving you a lot more than you're loving us. You're just taking resources everywhere. You're a net negative. And you're crossing the manhood isn't sex or some religious ceremony. You're crossing the manhood is when 
[P196]  you are start creating surplus value. You're loving more people than you're absorbing. You're listening to more complaints than you are complaining. You're creating more revenue than you're absorbing. That's the notion. It's surplus value. And I have this trick called what a man does. And I've been doing this when they're kids. I'm like, guests show up. A man goes and gets their luggage and puts it in their room. A man is constantly scanning the table for empty water glasses. And I mean, one of the proudest moments I ever had was when I'm like, 
[P197]  my six-year-old boy who was all like 30 pounds got up and went over this gigantic pitcher of water at this table and like started like trying to pour other people's water and everyone had no idea what was going on here. You know, I do these things called what a man does. A man goes up to, a man asks a woman out for coffee. A man pays for women. I'm a sexist that way. I still have told my men, my son gave me this rap on, oh dad, you're so establishment. I'm like, do you ever want to have sex? 
[P198]  I'm like, then you need to pay. I mean, that's the bottom line. Anyways, but what I would say is I'm trying to model. I'm trying to model good behavior or be a good role model. But I agree with Constantine and Daniel. I think every day they have more potential to lead the most amazing life in history. I'm not a nihilist. I'm not a catastrophist. I think I have big problems. But given the blessings of the sons born to these, 
[P199]  men and future you know future sons that you'll have steven jesus it's good to be them there's just they have no excuse they should they should they should rock on they should have a wonderful life constantine scott daniel thank you so much for taking the time um at sort of short notice to talk about all these subjects it's incredibly wide-ranging conversation and you'll bring such an interesting hilarious nuanced perspective to these issues i'm glad that we can have these conversations and disagree in a respectful way that hopefully clarifies a lot of the confusion that i

[P1] ﻿ The world is absolutely crazy right now. This is one of the most interesting moments of social, cultural and economic transition that I have ever seen. So I wanted to do something that I've never done before. I called upon three of the leading voices on social, cultural, business and economic issues to give their unfiltered, uncensored points of view so that we can all make sense of all of this craziness happening before our eyes. They don't always agree on much, but today they thrash it out to see if they can agree on something. 
[P2]  Go through the economy, Trump, Elon Musk, EEI, censorship, wokeism, and why so many men are struggling. Why are tens of thousands of millionaires running away from the UK? The terrifying truth and opportunity in AI. And I ask all of them, what is the most important thing in 2025 that nobody is talking about? With the aim of reaching clarity, agreement, and having a laugh in the process. This is the episode you probably didn't know you needed. 
[P3]  When we look at the back end of Spotify and Apple and our audio channels, the majority of people that watch this podcast haven't yet hit the follow button or the subscribe button, wherever you're listening to this. I would like to make a deal with you. If you could do me a huge favour and hit that subscribe button, I will work tirelessly from now until forever to make the show better and better and better and better. I can't tell you how much it helps when you hit that subscribe button. The show gets bigger, which means we can expand the production, bring in all the guests you want to see and continue to doing this thing we love. If you could do me that small favour and hit the follow button, 
[P4]  wherever you're listening to this, that would mean the world to me. That is the only favour I will ever ask you. Thank you so much for your time. Back to this episode. You guys are three of the best commentators, the most articulate people I know that also have the most interesting, broad experience and also I think political background. So I wanted to talk to you about everything that's going on in the world. And I wanted to ask you guys some of the dumb questions that I ponder alone with myself and with my dumb friends in my WhatsApp group. 
[P5]  It feels to me that the world is at a real moment of transition in many regards. So like social transition, cultural transition, economic transition. And I think the US has been a catalyst for all of that. So that's why I wanted to have this conversation today. We've got an American here, Scott. I think Scott's the only American here. We've got Constantine. We've got Daniel, who are two Brits, but spend a lot of time between America as well. And so I want to come to Scott first and ask Scott a question, which is a very big, broad question, 
[P6]  your perspective, Scott, you know, when I talk about this feeling of transition, that seems to be like almost inside my chest, that we're at a really historic moment. What is your analysis on this? What is the big picture here? What's happened over the last three, four, five, six, seven months? And how is that going to impact all of us around the world? Well, if you think of the US as setting the tone economically, and maybe even culturally for the West, there's definitely a reversion away from 
[P7]  people feel that quote-unquote wokeism, and I don't like to use that word, but I'll use it here, was this sort of overcorrection to systemic racism and that it began to cause more damage than it was or cause more problems than it was solving. And I think there's been a serious kind of lurch back, if you will, whether it's executive actions declaring the border, a state of emergency, stuff around saying that gender is a thing, 
[P8]  and female. And most of these issues, the actually American public supports, I would say on a more cynical level, America used to be a platform for prosperity, the protection of civil rights, the projection of women's rights and power and democracy abroad. And I would argue that it feels like a pretty quick transition to almost like a, you know, I call it a kleptocracy, but America has become a platform for 
[P9]  acquiring wealth and then leveraging that wealth as a means or a proxy of power. And the ultimate example of that was the launch of two meme coins, the Trump coin and the Melania coin, the day before the presidency, such that this conversation could have already or might happen this week. And I'll finish here. President Trump, it's Vlad. We're thinking about stabilizing our currency or trying to send the outflows of our reserves. 
[P10]  into the Trump coin, which, based on my economist estimation, would take the value of it to a $20 or $30 billion market cap, making you one of the wealthiest men in the world, Mr. Trump. And none of this would be disclosable or transparent. Also, in unrelated news, we'd really appreciate you seizing arms shipments to Ukraine. So I think we've gone kind of full kleptocracy is the way I would describe it. Are you optimistic, Scott? Well, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. 
[P11]  I don't know if I'm just getting older, but no, I don't see a man convicted of sexual abuse or found liable who inspired an insurrection retaking the White House as a point of light for the American experience. Constantine, I suspect you'd have a slightly different view on all of the above. How are you feeling about everything that happened yesterday? Did you watch the inauguration? What is your big picture, 30,000 feet view? 
[P12]  make bold predictions about what's going to happen over the next six to seven months. I do think what America had at the election and what the election of Donald Trump represents is something that we in the UK don't have, which is choice. They had a very clear choice between two very different perspectives on the world, between two very different approaches, between two very different candidates. And ultimately, criticisms of President Trump are necessary and legitimate. Of course they are. 
[P13]  But at the end of the day, I believe having spent quite a lot of time in America around election time and also just generally and traveling around real America, not just in D.C. and L.A. and New York. The reason that he was elected was that the American people are not prepared to accept what Europeans have decided they're prepared to accept, which is managed decline. The American people do not want their country to become weaker. They do not want it to become poorer. 
[P14]  impoverish their fellow citizens through net zero. What they want is their country to be great, their country to be powerful, their country to be influential. The economic realities for most Americans are not really reflected in the figures that we are told. So when people talk about inflation, the reality of people's lives on the ground is that their cost of living has gone up very, very significantly over the last few years. 
[P15]  overall inflation figure that we're shown because certain things are much more influential in people's lives than others. And so whether the decision to elect President Trump ends up being this positive thing for which there should be lots of optimism is a matter of the next four years. Are we going to see a presidency that really does everything it promises? And by the way, you know, if you look at the things that Donald Trump is promising, 
[P16]  Whether you're left or right, you have to acknowledge that they are things that are worth doing. Having a secure border so that people don't come into your country illegally is a basic duty of government. Economic prosperity is a basic duty of government. Withdrawing America from a kind of simultaneously aggressive but weak posture around the world where America sort of says, yeah, yeah, we're going to get involved in these foreign conflicts, 
[P17]  win that war is a kind of stupid position on both whichever side you're on. So on all of these things, and of course, you know, Scott mentioned wokeness. I think he's absolutely right that there is a massive backlash happening around the world because lots and lots of people who were completely apolitical until the last three or four years or maybe until 2016 just feel like the world has gone crazy and suddenly they're supposed to pretend that men can change sex and become women and now they're 
[P18]  entitled to be in female prisons. And, you know, if your teenager says that they are the opposite sex, you're supposed to chop their breasts off and all of this other stuff that ordinary people just look at and go, this is crazy. Like, I am liberal, but this isn't liberal. This is some kind of weird thing that's going on. And I see the backlash against all of that all over the Western world. And I think Donald Trump signifies that people are fed up of that. 
[P19]  that if the woke left continues to exercise this level of influence on our public debate, the reaction will be the rise of the right. And Donald Trump is one of the most diplomatic and pleasant versions of what you're likely to get if the left keeps going crazy. We will see what challenges the world throws at him over the next four years and whether he's capable of responding to them. 
[P20]  left lost its way in your view? And if so, how did that happen? And just to respond on some of Constantine's points about Trump being the best of a sort of right-wing collective, are we going to see right-wing sort of ideology spread throughout the Western world over the coming years? What's your take on all of the above? You definitely, you know, we Democrats, we get it right and then we just go too damn far. And so I look at, I'm a professor on a campus, 
[P21]  DEI, 60 years ago, there were 12 black people at Princeton, Yale, and Harvard combined. That was a problem. Race-based affirmative action makes sense. This year, more than half of Harvard's freshman class identifies as non-white. But 70% of those non-whites come from dual-income homes in the upper quintile of income-earning homes. The academic gap between black and white used to be double what it was between rich and poor. It's now flipped. So DEI was a good idea that, quite frankly, has gone insane 
[P22]  system it was trying to do away with. And then we created two candidates who were the only candidates who could make each other viable. Vice President Harris, given the hand she dealt with, did the best she did. I think President Biden should be buried in a crypt entitled narcissist who decided that it made sense for him to go back on his pledge to be a transition candidate and gave us a British-style election timing on the Democratic side in a marketplace. 
[P23]  or you need time and money. So it was not, we did not have a great candidate. There is an understandable swing back from what is an overcorrection around some of these issues. You know, parents, we gave them a huge issue with transgender rights. There's more Padel players in California than transgender people. And yet the Democrats decided to conflate it with the civil rights movement and think that it was okay for a woman who transitioned, a transgender woman, 
[P24]  enter a bicycle race and finish five minutes before everybody else, and then we all bark up the same tree and decide that it's inspiring. And parents all over the nation are saying, we've literally gone crazy. Where I would disagree a little bit with Constantine is that America choosing economic growth and prosperity, there are 190 sovereign nations in the world. 189 would change places with America over the last four years. We hit 71 new record highs in the markets, 97% of all AI. We've created more market capitalization 
[P25]  in a seven-mile radius of SFO International Airport than Europe's created in the last 20 years. We have the lowest inflation in the G7. We have the highest growth. We've grown 10% since 2020. That's triple the rate of Europe. Biden was unable to communicate any of that effectively because there's this psychological dynamic that when your wages go up, you credit your own grit and character, and when the price of cereal goes up, you blame the president. Now, similar to the future, or how William Gibson described the future, 
[P26]  It's here. It's just not evenly distributed. Prosperity is unprecedented in the U.S. over the last four years. It just wasn't evenly distributed. Now, having said that, in America, you can stop working in August and you've produced more and made more money than you have in Europe the whole year. And it has gotten better. It says things are less bad than anywhere in the world in the U.S. Biden was unable to communicate it. And then talking about how great the economy is when rents were skyrocketing, tuition was going up, it was an ineffective strategy. 
[P27]  But I don't think it's fair to say Americans chose prosperity. We have prosperity. 
[P28]  My favorite appointment in the Trump administration in the adult room is the 10 year bond, which is going to say, sorry, girlfriend, when I believe the president tries to implement some of these economic policies. Constantine, is that true? Because what I heard there is that effectively Trump had a better marketing campaign. And that reality is somewhat different from what the Americans were sold in the last election cycle. Well, politics is about marketing and Trump is the marketer in chief. 
[P29]  and partly that's what politics is about. But in terms of the economy, I think Scott is entirely right. It's one of the reasons I admire America so much, the sense of dynamism and economic growth and the desire to create things and build things. It's an observation I've had every time I've been there. You know, if you have a successful restaurant in the UK, you go, well, I've got a successful restaurant. In America, if you have a successful restaurant, you open a second one and a third one and you create a chain, right? So their attitude to business more broadly is, 
[P30]  is fantastic and I love it. But I think the difference is that I don't think Americans were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the European economies. They were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the American economy under Donald Trump in his first term and also what they expect him to do for the future. When they look at the fact that he's got real business leaders in government now, like Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk talking about government efficiency, 
[P31]  all Western countries have a massively bloated civil service, what we call civil service in the UK and the administrative state in the US that wastes a huge amount of money, that produces very little in terms of output in many cases. And that needs to be slimmed down. And people, I think, are very excited about that. And when I talk to business leaders in America, including ones that were never on the Trump train, so to speak, so many of them went over to his side in this election cycle. 
[P32]  because they just felt that he was going to continue to accelerate American growth and continue to deliver prosperity for the American people. Now, Scott's point about tariffs and all of these other things, you know, I've listened to Donald Trump enough now to know that you should not necessarily be taking him literally. I think many of the things he says are negotiation tactics and signaling. 
[P33]  build this or do that or do this. You have to sort of read between the lines when he says, you know, this will be the worst thing that you just go. He's saying to people like, you better work with me. Otherwise, this is going to work out badly for you on all of these things. And so it remains to be seen whether he's successful in those tactics of getting what he wants. Look, America is always going to be an unequal society. It's designed in a way that is going to make it that way. In America, the focus is how do we grow the pie? 
[P34]  In Europe, the focus is how do we divide it up so everyone gets their fair little share, right? So Americans are about expanding the pie and then the people who bake the pie get as much of it as they possibly can. But the question is, can there be a sense in America that the American dream is alive, that you do not have to work three gig economy jobs to pay your rent, that you're going to be able to buy a house, that you're going to be able to afford to have children, 
[P35]  raise a family, perhaps on a single income, something that most people only dream about nowadays. That's really what this whole economic conversation is about. And we will see over the next four years if Donald Trump is able to slightly even change the direction of travel towards those things that actually Americans of my generation and older used to take for granted as the promise of the country that they live in. I've thought a lot about this over the last couple of weeks in particular, 
[P36]  papers in the UK that millionaires are leaving the UK in historic numbers. I think it's 10,800 millionaires left last year, which is an increase of about 160% versus the previous year. And the general sentiment in terms of business confidence in the UK is at a several year low. So I think it's the lowest it's been since just post pandemic. There's this, I think it's the Institute of Accountants, they call up 1000 accountants every year, and they get they run a survey to see how much confidence 
[P37]  they have in business in this country. And it's fallen 14 points to 0.2% confidence in terms of business. But there's this bigger narrative emerging amongst my entrepreneurial friends that if you want to start a business right now, the best place to be in the world is to be in America, is to get over to America and to leave the UK. Now, Dan, how does that score? I know you have an accelerator, you speak to lots of entrepreneurs. How does that sort of compare or contrast with what you're seeing at the moment? Yeah, 100%. The value proposition for the UK has dropped through the floor. 
[P38]  Very, very high tax. The ecosystem of business is in decline. Some of the smartest people are now in Dubai. Some incredible creators that I know have moved to Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai. Many are going to the USA. So if people are interested in bigger markets and bigger opportunities, they're into the USA. If they're interested in lower tax and more fringe opportunities, they're in the Middle East. 
[P39]  a place in the world. I think there are three business models the UK could go for, which is either the head office of Europe, which is what we were when we were inside the EU, and everyone used to come here to build a European business. We could be the back office of the USA, so the incubator for the USA. A lot of smart companies get to their first 50 million of value here in the UK and then sell to a US private equity firm or US listed company. 
[P40]  And a lot of US companies are now actually coming here to poach talent or to outsource things to the UK more cheaply than they could do it in the US. The wages in the UK are through the floor compared to what you would pay in the US, especially in tech roles. So very smart people in the UK are massively devalued. 
[P41]  tax, model of Dubai, Singapore, you know, those kind of options. So we haven't really picked one of those three yet. We're still, you know, all these years after Brexit, and we haven't said which of those three models we want to adopt. Scott, you moved here a couple of years ago to the UK. And despite everything that's going on in the UK, are you still bullish on this being a place for entrepreneurship and business? I was looking at some stats 
[P42]  of key areas of concern for me. Business stats I've talked about there, the drop in business confidence, the entrepreneur exodus that we're seeing, but things like knife crime in the UK are up 81% over the last decade, which I think is a symptom probably of something else. And one of the big things I think a lot about as an entrepreneur at the moment is artificial intelligence. And our investment in artificial intelligence from a global perspective is down about 2000% versus a country like America. So you've moved here, you've brought your family here. 
[P43]  bullish on the UK versus the US from an entrepreneur's perspective? So the question I get most frequently when I speak here is to compare and contrast the US with the UK. And I use a personal anecdote. My parents immigrated to the US from Glasgow and London when they were 19 and 22. They took enormous risks. I've been an entrepreneur my whole life. I like to think that a lot of my success isn't my fault, that I inherited sort of that risk-taking DNA. And when I speak to people in the UK, I say the primary difference is 
[P44]  And that is, it kind of comes down to a risk appetite. The U.S. has five times per capita the number of entrepreneurs. It has five times the dollar volume per startup. There's $5 million in venture capital waiting to be deployed for every startup in the U.S. versus $1 million in Europe. I love what Constantine said about a restaurant. I went into this great little restaurant in Soho a few weeks ago called Dig In, and I loved it so much. I left my card and said, can you have the owner? 
[P45]  I'd like to open another one. Does he need money? I just would never do that here. I thought that was a really interesting insight. And the collision of risk, crazy ideas that occasionally become crazy genius and technology and intellectual property and great universities results in a company that no one had heard of five years ago being worth more than the entire UK stock market, NVIDIA. So there's just an enormous difference. 
[P46]  my impression of the UK economy, I'll just say London. I have no experience in it. I don't go anywhere that's not walking distance from Marlebone. So my bubble is pretty opaque. But the way I would describe the economy here is I love the term the butler economy. And that is all the money I see being made here is people servicing wealth created somewhere else. You're either in financial services servicing rich people. You're either opening a restaurant or hospitality. 
[P47]  quality servicing rich people, but I don't see a lot of organic wealth creation. I interviewed the two, quote unquote, inventors of AI at one of your prestigious universities. My first question is, how the hell were you not able to make any money if you invented AI? Why haven't you been able to capture any money? But just for your listeners, my summation of Europe versus the US after molesting the earth for the last 35 years is US is still the best place to make money and Europe is still the best place to spend it. Is this a failing nation, Scott? 
[P48]  I think you have too much going for you to be described as a failing nation. You still have amazing universities. London's still the second best city in the world. Premier League, it's an unbelievable export. I know how ridiculous that sounds. People want to be here. There's still rule of law, rule of play. You still produce amazing rock and roll. I just don't see how you could say this is a failed. I would argue that second only to our entry into Iraq, 
[P49]  An American can't understand why you would decide to increase your prices while reducing productivity in one fell swoop. It's difficult for us to wrap our heads around some of the economic decisions the UK has made. But I think a lot of people are kind of betting or hoping that the UK begins to grow again. So in a weird way, I would call myself cautiously optimistic about the UK. I think at some point it registers. 
[P50]  it begins to occupy the place it should command, if you will. Constantine, I would ask the same question to you as well. Do you think the UK is a failing nation? And Scott describes self-inflicted wounds there. I've heard you speak of self-inflicted wounds when you talk more broadly about the West and what the West needs to do to turn itself around. And also just layering a third point on top of that, which is somewhat linked to this, is Elon Musk has taken a particular interest in the UK over the last month in particular. 
[P51]  started to describe it online, it seems, as a failing nation. What's your view? Well, I'm glad you asked me about Elon Musk, because the thing that I love most about the media having this massive meltdown about, oh, no, these Americans are interfering in our political... These are the same media commentators who are constantly banging on about American politics and saying, Donald Trump needs to do this, you need to vote for this. Like, all of this stuff is ridiculous. The reality is we download our culture, our politics, 
[P52]  almost everything from America, right? America has become what Britain used to be, which is the center of Western civilization. And my request and ask and begging of British people is, if we're going to download American culture and politics, let's at least take the good stuff instead of all this terrible woke shit that we downloaded from them, the DEI and all this other nonsense, and actually take the entrepreneurial spirit and all these other things that are really great about America, the optimism, 
[P53]  the positivity, the willingness to have a go, to take a risk, as Scott was talking about. So I wish we took more of that. And it speaks to your question about are we a failing nation? Look, I think it's a deliberately inflammatory question, which I don't want to kind of actually accept in that way. But what I think we should acknowledge is are we trending up or are we trending down? And when you talk about over 10,000 millionaires, 
[P54]  have left. I hear that through a normal British person's ear. And I worry that there's quite a lot of British people who will hear that and say, oh, good, all of these rich parasites have left. Because that's our attitude in the UK to a very large extent. We see wealthy people not as what they are, which is for the most part, not everybody, but for the most part, people who've created a tremendous amount of value for their fellow human beings. And as a result of that, 
[P55]  have been rewarded. We see them because we, you know, we have this history of the landed gentry. And so to us, a millionaire is someone who has these ill-gotten gains that they don't deserve, right? That is not really the world we live in. When I talk to wealthy people in this country and pretty much everywhere else, for the most part, especially in the Western world, these are people who've created something that has fundamentally helped other human beings do something better, do something easier, 
[P56]  products, cheaper, whatever it is. That's who the successful people really are. And we just need an attitude shift. That's what we should be downloading from America. What we should be saying inside our heads is this person is successful because they've helped other people. Great. How do we get more of those people into our country? And I'm afraid I'm telling you something that you know better than anyone, Stephen. If you don't have entrepreneurs in your country creating businesses and creating jobs, 
[P57]  eternity. We have to get smart, talented, driven people into our country instead of chasing them out. Dan, I know this is a subject that you're very passionate about, and Konstantin's articulated it really, really well. I've seen lots of your posts about this subject, Dan. What are you seeing? And is it true that the British attitude is a form of self-harm that's holding us back from our potential? There are definitely attitudinal factors, but you'll also get the most incredibly entrepreneurial people here in London. London is a melting pot for 
[P58]  creativity. You've got sitting in one city, you've got people who are phenomenal at media, finance, technology, entertainment, politics, defense, like all of this. Like if you take the best of LA and Washington and New York and Miami and kind of start moving it into one city, you know, you get elements of that in London. It's a very diverse city from that point of view, and it creates an entrepreneurial melting pot. The issue is taxes. Nobody wants to pay 
[P59]  60% of their income in taxes. And as soon as you hit, you know, in the US, you don't hit the top tax rate until you are six times the average wage. Here in the UK, it's two and a half times. So as soon as you're two and a half times the average wage, you're in real trouble. There are so many people in the UK who deliberately hold their income at £50,000 because after £50,000, you get taxed 40% of your income. So people just give up and they say, I'm not going, I know some 
[P60]  really smart, really talented people who could be earning a lot more and they refuse to pay the 40% rate. So they like keep everything small because they don't want to go from 20 to 40% at the 50 grand rate, which is crazy. And I've employed people who have said, can I have a day off a week rather than going over that threshold? So, you know, that's a huge issue, the tax issue. The company rate tax is high. The corporate capital gains rate is taxed very high. The VAT is high. 
[P61]  The council tax is high. All of these additional taxes just keep piling up. And then the other cost at the moment, if we want to have an AI economy, we need cheap electricity. One thing that Trump has committed to is really, really cheap energy. There is no such thing as a fast growth, high octane economy that has expensive energy. Cheap energy equals fast growth. And we have the most expensive energy in the world. 
[P62]  Scott, you look like a lot of thoughts are going through your head following those two comments. What are you thinking? 
[P63]  that we have a housing crisis and that the executive order should have been around that. Just going back to the U.S., and I'm curious of the same dynamics and whether Constantine and Daniel agree with us. I believe this, the election in the U.S. was supposed to be a referendum on women's rights. Women's rights did not show up. This was a referendum on young men, in my view. And that is, if you look at the two cohorts that swung most from blue to red versus 2020, two of the three cohorts, other than Latinos, 
[P64]  was people under the age of 30 who in the U.S. are 24% less wealthy than they were 40 years ago, people over the age of 70 or 72% wealthier. Our tax code is basically an attempt to shove money from the young to the old. And two, 45 to 64-year-old women who I would affectionately describe as their mother. And that is when your son's in the basement vaping and playing video games, and I think a lot about struggling young men, you don't give a flying fuck about territorial sovereignty in the Ukraine, or Ukraine, excuse me, or transgender rights. 
[P65]  is your kid isn't doing well. And 210 times a day, your kid's getting a notification that somebody he knows is on a Gulfstream or partying in St. Bart's and it's not him or her. And so we not only have young people not doing as well, this pornographic wealth is just shoved in their face. And you end up with, in my opinion, kind of a young, struggling young man. No group has fallen further faster in the world, I would argue, than young men in America. 
[P66]  a morgue in the United States and there's five people who died by suicide, four of them are men. One in three men under the age of 30 has a girlfriend. Two in three women under the age of 30 has a boyfriend. Why? You think that's mathematically impossible? Because women are dating older because they want more economically and emotionally viable men. There's one in five men live at home at the age of 30. One in three under the age of 25. They're not having sex. They're more obese. They're more depressed. When women don't have a relationship, they oftentimes channel that energy 
[P67]  into their professional lives. More single women own homes in the U.S. than single men. Women in urban areas under the age of 30 are making more money than men. When men don't have the guardrails of a relationship or a job or being in school, they pour that energy sometimes into unproductive things, misogyny, nationalism or extreme nationalism, conspiracy theory. In some, they become really shitty citizens. They become sequestered from society. So I'm worried in the U.S., our biggest threat is a new species of asexual. 
[P68]  asocial young men who are incredibly dangerous have opted out of America. 60% of 30-year-olds used to have one child in America, and that's 27%. So people, I think, in the U.S., and this is a genuine question. I don't know if it's the same problem here. Our tax policies have taken money from the young, stuffed them in the pockets of old people so Nana and Pop-Pop can upgrade from Carnival to Crystal Cruises. Meanwhile, young people can't afford education. They can't afford housing. 
[P69]  And we especially see this really acute emerging crisis among young men who are just opting out of America, who don't even want to try and date, don't even want to enroll in school, don't want to even try and get a job, just stick in their basements and go on Reddit or Discord, or why go try and shower or work out and get a relationship when you have you porn? Why get a job when you can trade stocks or crypto on Coinbase or Robinhood? 
[P70]  In my opinion, this is the most dangerous trend in America right now. It was almost like demonizing men for decades has consequences. I mean, this is what's been happening. Men are the root of all evil, the root of all evil, the root of all evil. Every advert is about, you know, the woman is strong and capable. The guy's pathetic. In every movie, the woman's kicking ass and the man is pathetic. This has been going on for decades. It's a cultural thing as well as an economic thing. 
[P71]  meaning and opportunity away from men. If you create an education system that punishes boys for being boys, if you create a society in which traditional masculine virtues become vices, then you will create exactly the sort of thing that Scott is talking about. It's a terrible thing that's been done. Having said that, my message is always the same to young men who I hope are listening, which is the answer to your problems is never going to be, as Scott says, porn and this and that. 
[P72]  the answer to your problems is going to take responsibility, go out and get a job or create a business and actually make your life better. No one's coming to save you. No one's coming to help you. There is no, the sort of programs that we have for women where we sort of go, well, you know, let's give them an opportunity here. None of that's happening for men. It's not going to happen because for evolutionary reasons, we just don't feel sorry for men the way that we do for women. That's a reality. I know it sucks, 
[P73]  men is going to be the answer that's always been the answer for men, which is for you to get off the sofa, to get off the couch and go out and actually do and create and build and find your own way through it. Even if you have to acknowledge that the society you live in has been conditioned for quite a long time to think that you're a piece of shit because you happen to have the genitalia that you do. Now, that I think is the harsh reality of it. And I think Scott is right to point this out as a problem. And I hope that we start to have 
[P74]  both in terms of economic policy, but in terms of also just the cultural conversations and the way we talk about these issues, we come back to something that human beings have known through the entire history of our species, which is men and women are both good and need to work together in order to thrive and succeed together, in order to have families, in order to have children, and in order for us to have healthy communities and healthy societies. You need healthy femininity and you need healthy masculinity, and they need to come together and work together. 
[P75]  Together, that's what we're supposed to do. And these stupid gender wars and this idea that men as a group are this and women as a group are that, all of that just needs to end. I was watching last night as Trump sat there signing all of those executive orders. And I also watched his inauguration speak where he said, we will forge a society that is colourblind and merit-based. And he signed a bunch of executive orders last night to eliminate a variety of different DEI programmes in the federal government, 
[P76]  We've seen 
[P77]  whack DEI measures. So I think there's a lot of nuance here. I would argue in universities, DEI is used as a giant misdirect from people such as myself who are enforcers of the caste system and wake up every morning and look in the mirror and ask ourselves the same question. How do I increase my compensation while decreasing my accountability? And what I found is the ultimate strategy is to create an LVMH rejectionist bullshit, elitist strategy, where Dartmouth sits on a 
[P78]  endowment of $8 billion and lets in 500 kids. So the conversation around who gets in is a misdirect from the important question that is how many. If you are not growing your endowment or your freshman class faster than population, you should lose your tax-free status. We should be letting in more gay kids, more trans kids, more white Republicans from rural state. You know who doesn't talk about DEI? Junior colleges, because there's no admissions. They don't have a problem with DEI. 
[P79]  own tail, started out with the right idea. Now it's nothing. And I would argue the same is somewhat true of the Democratic Party. I went to the Democratic National Convention. On the dnc.org website, it lists 17 special introscripts, and it says explicitly who we serve, Asian Pacific Islanders, seniors, veterans, Black Americans, the disabled. It basically lists, I added this up, 76% of the population. And when you say you're actively advocating for 76% 
[P80]  of the population. You're not advocating for 76% of the population. You're discriminating against the 24%. It's gone too far. I would argue in the workplace, having served on seven public company boards, and I'm going to do a lot of boasting here because I'm desperate for all of your affirmation, and 12 private company boards, there's still work to be done in the private sector. There still is a cycle. 40% of all venture capitalists and probably 70% or 80% of all venture capital deployed 
[P81]  are white guys from just two universities, Stanford and Harvard. So I would argue universities, it's gotten out of control. I'd love to see the DEI apparatus disassembled, along with the ethics department, the sustainability department, the leadership department. These are all bullshit where we hire formerly important people with no standards. They never get fired. It just translates to more student debt. In the boardroom, in corporations, in certain sectors, I do think there is a need to be thoughtful about broadening the aperture of the lens 
[P82]  people who are underrepresented. There's still a dearth of women raising venture capital. So I think it's nuanced based on sector. But to just say all DEI is bad, I want to move to where the University of California did in 1997. They don't have race-based affirmative action. They have adversity-based affirmative action. I'm a beneficiary of affirmative action. I had something called Pell Grants. I was raised by a single immigrant mother who lived and died as secretary. So I got grants. I had 
[P83]  unfair advantage because I came from a household that was low income. And I think that there should be affirmative action. And I think it should be based on color, but that color is green. The poor need our help. The moment you start advocating for a special advantage based on any external factors, I think at this point in our society, it probably causes more problems than it solves. That's exactly right. That's exactly right, Stephen. 
[P84]  take a step back and look at why DEI has become such a big part of the conversation, it's precisely because instead of addressing the reality of people's lives, which is some people are disadvantaged and some people are advantaged, actually what we've mainly done, and Scott alluded to at the very beginning of our discussion, is we've given a leg up to very wealthy ethnic minority people from successful families, and they now, their children now get into 
[P85]  prestigious universities, which they probably would have done anyway, some of them, because they come from very advanced backgrounds. And the kids that are growing up in poverty, black and white, have no shot whatsoever. But the reason that it's become such a big issue around the Western world, actually, I don't think it's the nuances that we've delved into here, but actually something else, which is we have created the most ethnically diverse societies in history. And what I mean by that is, 
[P86]  not that we've created societies in which there are large groups of people who are different from each other, but for the first time probably in human history, we've created societies in which there is a lot of ethnic diversity and there is no overt discrimination against some groups of people in the sense of, you know, the imperial societies in the past would have had one dominant ethnic group, which is, you know, the Russians in the Soviet Union or the Turks in the Ottoman Empire 
[P87]  in the British Empire, whatever. That was the ethnic group that was like the dominant one. And everybody else was a kind of second-class citizen and everybody knew it, right? We don't have that anymore. We have highly diverse societies where people of every single background exist in which we have this idea that we're all supposed to be equal. And when we have programs that explicitly discriminate against people, there were times when the discrimination was explicit 
[P88]  black people. Well, we've gone full circle now where the discrimination was going the other way in university admissions, in hiring, in corporate America, in government, in all sorts of things. You know, in this country, the BBC has internships that aren't available to white people, etc. When you get to that point, as Scott said earlier on, everyone just goes, look, I know I'm not supposed to say this, but the reality is this is racism. This is a form of racism. And I thought we were trying to get away from the 
[P89]  So to the extent that the elimination of DEI is about creating a merit-based society in which people are given an opportunity because they're skilled and talented and they have the potential to actually achieve things and create wealth. You know, we all know this. We all employ people, right? How many of us are thinking about the races of the people we hire? I don't think we think about that at all. What we're thinking about is I run a business. I need the very best personable. 
[P90]  very best possible person for this job at the price I'm willing to pay. I don't care if they are purple, green, blue, white, whatever. It doesn't matter. What matters is, are we getting the best person for the job? And my concern about identity politics has always been that if we do not adopt that worldview, then what we will do is create a worldview in which we have different racial groups competing with each other on the basis of race. 
[P91]  very dangerous mix for a multi-ethnic society like ours, which is why I've been begging people to let go of this stupid idea of identity politics and to say, first and foremost, we are all Brits or we are all Americans. We have this umbrella identity under which we all operate and our personal ethnicity or sex or whatever is secondary to that and actually for the purposes of employment, for the purposes of college admission, et cetera, is irrelevant. 
[P92]  Yes, if there is disadvantage, if we grew up in a single-parent home with a low income, we may need some extra support there. If we had terrible schooling or our education was not good, we may need extra support. If there's certain things that make it easier for us because of the disadvantages we've had to fulfill our talent and potential, I am all for that. But what we've created so far, and that's why I'm delighted it's being eliminated, is an anti-meritocratic system which says, 
[P93]  We don't care what you bring to the workplace. We don't care whether you deserve this place or not. We don't care about the potential you have. Actually, we just needed an insert category tick box to fill this slot. And you filled it. It doesn't really matter that you're not doing your job very well because now we can say, you know, we're a diverse company. I don't care about that and we shouldn't care about that as a society. And thank God that's now gone. Yeah, I think the worst part about it too is that it calls into question 
[P94]  and they're from a diverse background, you know, it calls into question why they got that job in the first place, which I think is horrible. You know, I just hired from two candidates, the final two candidates was a guy and a woman. I would hate if the woman felt that she got the job because she's a woman and not because she's best. She turns out she was by far the best in the process. And I would love for her to know that there was absolutely nothing that changed our view. 
[P95]  We weren't trying to fill a position with a woman. We were trying to fill the position with the best, and she should know she was the best. I think the contrast that was really fascinating was between Trump's website and the Democrats' website. So in the Democrats' website, it was who we're for, which was what Scott was saying. But Trump's website was the 20 things we're going to do, and it was just a list of 20. These are the 20 action points. This is what we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this. 
[P96]  as opposed to the identities that we want to advantage list. And I think that was the choice. You know, at the beginning, Constantine, you said, you know, America had a choice. And for me, when I looked at those two websites, I saw this choice between the identities being the main thing or the to-do list being the main thing and very different approaches. Scott, when I was listening to that Zuckerberg interview talking about masculinity and identity issues, one of the lines he said in there, 
[P97]  like something you've said on my show before, where he said, I think having a culture that celebrates that aggression a little bit more, talking about masculinity, has its own merits that are really positive. Now, Mark Zuckerberg isn't necessarily someone that I saw closely aligning to your worldview. Am I right in thinking that that's something you agree with? Because I remember you saying to me, you think people should be able to walk in a room and kick everyone's ass. What I've said on your show is that I think the male form, especially under the age of 30, 
[P98]  with its bone structure, incredible double-twitch muscle, and then this amazing, amazing chemical called testosterone, you're going to look back at your 25-year-old self and think, why wasn't I a fucking monster like Steve Barley? And also, there is some masculinity when Russian soldiers pour over the border in Ukraine. You want some of that big dick energy that Daniel was talking about. In the case of Zuckerberg, 
[P99]  I don't think he really understands an aspirational view of masculinity. I think when he couches immediately kind of trying to kiss Trump's ass because Trump threatened to put him in prison, and what he used to call moderation, he's now calling censorship. And when you have an algorithm that elevates incendiary hateful content, I would not describe that as masculinity. For me, masculinity comes down to protection, providing, and procreation. 
[P100]  Iадib Axel- He's about gendering a workplace in the context of trying to excuse a total elimination of what I would think is probably healthy moderation. I imagine Daniel and Constantine might have a different view. 
[P101]  Right now, when I talk about masculinity, you know, there's if I say at a conference, oh, women are better managers. Everyone goes, yes, that's right. That's right. Right. That's OK. If I say men are more risk aggressive and make better entrepreneurs, you're a misogynist. You're out. And the reality is men and women bring different attributes. But the masculinity and femininity, I think masculinity is a wonderful thing. I think we need a different image of it. I think people born as male have an easier time leaning into those things. 
[P102]  I work out at CrossFit with a bunch of lesbian firefighters. They bring great masculine energy, and they could carry my ass out of a fire. So a lot of men demonstrate wonderful feminine qualities. A lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculine qualities. I don't think these things are sequestered to anyone born as a specific gender. What I think, when I talk about masculinity, I don't talk about it in the role of corporations. I think that's as fraught with risk and not worth talking about. It should be about shareholder value or stakeholder value. 
[P103]  I think young men need a code. We're going to church less. We have fewer relationships. So what's the code you hold on to in terms of creating behaviors that are productive for you, yourself, society? And I think masculinity needs to be redefined as something more aspirational where you're celebrated for being really fucking strong. You're celebrated for not complaining. You're celebrated for creating surplus value. You create more tax revenue than you absorb. You're celebrated for being aggressive. You're celebrated for breaking up fights at bars. 
[P104]  not starting them. You're celebrated for protecting your country, not shitposting it. You're celebrated for approaching strange women and expressing romantic interest. That's not a crime. And if she's not interested and you're rejected, you're both going to be fine. You're celebrated for getting out of the house. You're celebrated for working. You're celebrated for making money and liking money. I think there just needs to be a redefinition of masculinity in the context of helping young men 
[P105]  code that they used to get from the armed services or from dual parent households. And I feel like they're struggling. So I like the idea of something that they feel in their bones and in their body and in their DNA that they can lean into that we celebrate. And the conversation is flipped entirely. Five years ago, I was called a misogynist for talking about masculinity. Now the conversation is being led and advocated by one group, and it's mothers who are like, 
[P106]  My son is not doing well. I got three kids, two daughters, daughters in PR with the other ones at Penn, and my son is in the basement vaping and playing video games. He needs something to latch on to. He needs a code. Anyways, but I apologize. Word salad. Zuckerberg and masculinity, give me a fucking break. He looks like a Chechen Molly dealer. Sorry, back to you, Stephen. Well, it's interesting when you speak, Scott, because your views on masculinity 
[P107]  me to be most better represented by the right side of politics than the left side of politics. They both have their own vision of masculinity. And yours seems to be a Republican view of masculinity. To Trump's credit, he saw the opportunity and he flew right into the manosphere. Rockets, crypto, Joe Rogan, Theo Vaughn. He said, no, I'm not going to run from this. I'm going to fly right into it. Now, I would argue that his vision of masculinity has too much 
[P108]  coarseness, too much cruelty, too much bullying. I don't think that's masculinity. I think when we talk about Elon Musk taking risks, sending rockets that are captured by scissors coming down, inspiring the EV race, taking an enormous risk, making a shit ton of money. Yeah, that's a great form of masculinity. Accusing men trying to save high soccer players, calling them pedophiles, calling your employees a sex criminal such that they have to leave their house, having 13 kids by five women or three women, none of which you live with, 
[P109]  Sleeping next to a loaded gun, losing control of your self-control because of addiction. I don't think that's a great role model. I think it's an amazing role model for boys. I don't think it's a great role model for men. In terms of energy, there are so many reasons why I'm a big matcha fan, if you don't already know by now. And so much so that I actually invested in the UK's leading matcha company called Perfect Ted. And one of my favorite Perfect Ted products is these delicious matcha pouches that come in every flavor from salted caramel, 
[P110]  to peach flavor, to mint flavor, to berry flavor. One of my favorites is this vanilla flavor, which I'm going to make in just two seconds. You just take this mixer here, get a little bit of the powder, pop it on top of the shaker like that. Put the lid on. Shake, shake, shake. Delicious. If you haven't tried this yet, you can find Perfect Ted at Tesco and Holland Barrett stores or online where you can get 40% off with my code, Diary40. 
[P111]  put in code Diary40 to try this delicious multi-flavored matcha now. Highly recommend. And if you do it, please tag me, send me a message online. Do you know that 80% of New Year's resolutions fail by February? It's because we focus too much on the end goal and we forget the small daily actions that actually move us forward. Those actions that are easy to do are also easy not to do in life. It's easy to save a dollar, so it's also easy not to. Making one small improvement each day, one tiny step in the right direction, has a big difference over time. 
[P112]  mindset, which is why we created The 1% Diary, a 90-day journal designed to help you stay consistent and focus on the small wins and make real progress over time. It also gives you access to The 1% Community, a space where you can stay accountable, motivated, inspired, along with many others on the same journey. We launched The 1% Diary in November and it sold out. So now we're doing a second drop. Head to thediary.com to grab yours before it sells out again. I'll put the link below. 
[P113]  Censorship. The word censorship was used there by Scott. We've seen this reversal in Meta's attitude, Facebook's attitude that had been built up over a decade, where it almost felt like if you had sort of right-leaning views or really any unaccepted views and you posted those on Facebook, you would face maybe having the post deleted or your account suspended. This new world of speech, of free speech, and as it pertains to masculinity. 
[P114]  noticed, Scott, you'd left X. You no longer post or tweet on X anymore. Do you think Elon's decision to buy X is a net positive for society? Net, yes. But I think what people hear when you say that is there's no problems with this system than, you know, compared to the ones we had before. There are definitely disadvantages to a free platform like X now. And one of them is 
[P115]  inevitably when you remove censorship, one of the things the censorship was doing was keeping all the deeply unpleasant people away from being able to shove things in your face. And that happens quite a lot on it. So I don't enjoy that aspect of it. But I've always said that would be the price that we would pay for freedom. Freedom always has a price, and that's what we're seeing. As for Zuckerberg, his miraculous transformation into a free speech warrior 
[P116]  And I'm delighted to welcome him. I'm sure it's entirely genuine and not anything to do with the election results we've just seen in any way whatsoever. And the fact that the culture shifted and those of us who were being censored by people like him for years actually winning the argument. Well, what it shows you is we've won the argument on free speech when it comes to the big tech platforms. And it's going to be messy. 
[P117]  that are algorithmically driven, where the truth and the moderate reasonable take is not what usually gets attention, you're going to see a lot of unpleasantness. I value the ability to hear and communicate truthful ideas and facts over my own subjective feelings. Oh, someone said a thing I don't like or someone was racist or someone was misogynistic. I don't enjoy the fact that that happens. 
[P118]  but I would rather that happened and also we were not being censored from saying, you know, COVID probably came from a lab in China, which we were. You know, the Hunter Biden laptop story isn't Russian disinformation. Actually, it's an important piece of information that American voters need to hear when they're making their decision about the election. And all of these other things that were being suppressed and censored across social media for years, they're not anymore. 
[P119]  that's a good thing. And I think that's helpful. And if you look at, you know, to bring it back to the UK for a moment, Stephen, as you know, on Trigonometry, we've tried to cover the grooming gangs scandal and is an outrage what happened in this country over decades. We've been covering that for years, since about 2019, 2020, to very little purchase. And one of the reasons is it was just something that the media sort of covered and then moved on, when it actually should have been something we talked about on 
[P120]  daily basis until serious action was taken. And we saw real, real change, real change in policing, real change in social work, real change in government, real change in the way that these racially aggravated hate crimes were treated. Well, none of that was really being talked about seriously until Elon kicked up a fuss, amplified the voices of survivors, amplified the voices of campaigners on X, which he bought. And now the British government is forced 
[P121]  to do whatever it can to actually address those issues to the extent that it will. A lot of people will say it still doesn't go far enough. Well, if it doesn't go far enough, we now have a platform from which we can continue to have that conversation until there is the sort of inquiry and the sort of outcomes that people want to actually deliver real change. So is that a positive? God, yes. God, yes. We needed that. 
[P122]  by someone like Elon Musk on a platform like X, which is now free, to the point where Keir Starmer is forced into defensive action. I wish that was around 30 years ago because a hell of a lot of young girls and women wouldn't have suffered the way they did if we had the opportunity to get that message out. So, God, yes, it's a net positive. Just to pick up on that, Constantine, I've had a question in my mind for a while regarding the scandal, which is horrific, I think it's something we all definitely agree on, is why has Elon chosen 
[P123]  now? And why has he chosen Keir Starmer as the sort of central target of this flurry of tweets around the grooming scandals? Because there's clearly, Elon's, I think, an individual which you can kind of see thinking in real time. Like if you go back through his tweets, because there's so many of them, and they kind of come in these spurts, you can almost see what he's getting at. Is there an underlying reason why he's made this a central issue over the last couple of weeks? 
[P124]  is actually most Americans were completely unaware of this issue until recently. I remember a year ago speaking at a private event in New York and somebody said to me, well, you know, what is the consequence of political correctness? Why are you so against it? Why are you so against censorship? And I talked about the grooming gangs and people were horrified. They hadn't even, and these are well-informed, educated people who are media savvy and whatever. So one of the reasons is I think to a lot of Americans, this issue is only coming to the fore. 
[P125]  now in front of their mind. The second issue, I think, is that Elon Musk understands what I said earlier, which is we have a global Western culture now. And so what happens in Britain matters just as much as what happens in America, because we are symbiotic with each other now. When there's a restriction of speech in the UK, when we have laws about what people are not allowed to say, that has an impact across the world. When you see the European Union trying to pass legislation, 
[P126]  about online censorship. That has an impact because if something exists in the UK and in many European countries, it's only a matter of time before people in America are going to say, well, look, they've got this in Europe. Why don't we bring it over here? And vice versa. So what happens in America affects us in Europe and in the UK. And what happens in Europe and the UK affects America. So what Elon, I think, is trying to do is to say, we care about our civilization. Elon doesn't really talk that much about the United States. 
[P127]  about our civilization as I do, because I believe that we are now one thing to a very significant extent. Now, from our civilizational point of view, is it a good thing that mass rape gangs in the UK are being insufficiently investigated and treated improperly by the police and the government? No, it's not. It's a very bad thing. So how do we address that? Well, we address that by putting pressure on the government of the day. Now, I don't see the grooming gangs as a party political issue. 
[P128]  it properly, although there were individual members of the cabinet that tried to do something like Sir Le Braverman. But he's putting pressure on the government of the day. You can see him going after Nigel Farage, of all people, and saying Nigel Farage is not the right leader for reform. So he's attempting to shape British politics in the direction that he feels is the right way. What does he want? What outcome does he want? Look, I don't know what Elon Musk wants. I don't know him personally. I haven't even yet had a chance 
[P129]  to interview him, which I really look forward to doing, because I think he's one of the great visionaries of our time. Whether you like him or not, I think that's undeniably true. But my sense is he's trying to talk about all the things that we've been discussing, freedom of expression, the end of identity politics and the pursuit of meritocracy, a pioneering, inspiring vision of the future, which is why he's talking about Mars and a vision for our civilization that goes beyond the narrow squabbling 
[P130]  here on Earth. And the understanding that human beings are meant, we left the cave. We're not supposed to stay in a place with the walls closing in on us and feel like we're in decline. We're not supposed to be a civilization that has 1.5 children per woman and that is simply just leaving the planet Earth because we can't reproduce. We're supposed to look at the future with hope and optimism. We're supposed to say, 
[P131]  I want things to be better for my children. I want to have children. I want the vision of our society being one of positivity and optimism and a sense of a pioneering vision and inspiration. That's what I think he wants. And I don't really see any of that in the current government in the UK. And I think he's right to go after them and say, you are destroying your country's economy. You're destroying its culture. You're destroying its sense of cohesiveness by allowing illegal immigration. 
[P132]  You are destroying that sense of optimism and vision. And you're not saying to people, let's build something better. You're saying, let's stay small. Let's play small. Let's not rise above our station. And I think we need people like that, imperfect as they may be in all sorts of different ways, to drive our civilization forward, to say to us, there is an inspiring vision to which we're all moving, as opposed to just sitting there and waiting to die, which is what we've been doing for far too long. 
[P133]  I think Elon is taking him at his word. You know, he said a year ago that he was going to absolutely dismantle the woke mind virus globally and he was going to ensure meritocracy and free speech. And when he sets his mind on something, he has the ability to stay focused on it for a very long time to a degree most people can't fathom. You know, and he's absolutely willing to endure pain. He loves a fight. He obviously has the kind of mind that can't relax unless he's kind of grinding up against some gear. 
[P134]  as well. Like the way he works needs stress in his life. He needs a big enemy. He needs a big fight to engage with. And I think Keir Starmer just ticked all of his boxes as someone to go up against. I think what's interesting is we talk about these big tech. I love that Scott has previously talked about breaking up big tech. And I think there's potential for that in the next four years. All of these guys like Trump and JD Vance and all of them have locked horns with big tech. 
[P135]  and they've come, you know, this is their chance to get revenge on big tech in the next four years. They could do a little, you know, you might see Google have to, you know, spin off YouTube or you might see AWS have to come away from Amazon or something like that. Who knows? But it's interesting that a lot of these big tech guys, they're probably cozying up to Trump because, you know, that could be on the cards as well. There's been a lot of Trump butt kissing over the last couple of weeks. 
[P136]  bragged about the fact that everybody's flown down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss his butt and to cozy up with him. And there's now headlines saying that there's this tech oligarchy forming in the United States where Bezos and Elon and Zuck are all now friends and they're stood behind Trump as this unifying force. Just to touch on a few points of that, but also on Constantine's message that Elon is doing this for the betterment of humanity, to further humanity, his involvement with the UK, but his broader involvement in politics now. Scott, does that square with how you think about Elon? 
[P137]  And I am quite curious to ask you why you made the decision to leave X and to go to Blue Sky and Threads and things like that. Yeah, I can't speculate on what motivates Elon Musk. I quite frankly just don't get the guy. And I don't have the domain expertise to comment on the rape gangs. It's such a serious, upsetting issue. I don't know it well enough to speak intelligently to it. Just the topic of censorship, though, as it relates to meta, 
[P138]  A hallmark of a free society and a democracy is that pretty much anyone can say pretty much anything about pretty much anybody. I believe that. The question is, do machines and bots have free speech rights? Because if I say something, I believe, and I may be paranoid, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong. I believe VCs whose portfolio companies I've said have overvalued have enlisted thousands of bots to basically just shitpost me over and over on X to diminish my credibility. 
[P139]  critical of Putin that the GRU has hired troll farms to create lists of thousands of people to weaponize bots to say disparaging things about them. Do those bots have free speech rights? In addition, when Fox News distributes information to its anchors saying Dominion voting machines were weaponized by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, despite the fact they knew that was not true, but they tell their broadcasters to do it anyways. And then Dominion says, this hurt our business. 
[P140]  and you knew it was false, and you decided to communicate it anyways, courts find them liable. They have to pay three quarters of a billion dollars. What happened at Fox News was a dumpster fire compared to the nuclear mushroom cloud on Meta. So a lot of what we're talking about here, if you want to say that mRNA vaccines alter your DNA, I think you should have the right to say that. The dissenter's voice is important because occasionally the conspiracy theorist ends up being correct. 
[P141]  is, when you have a business model that elevates the most incendiary, ugly content beyond its organic reach, should you then be exonerated from all liability and slander that traditional media companies are liable to? If we were to say that Elon Musk is a pedophile and start stating facts and evidence of it, and he could show that it's hurt his ability to raise money for Tesla, and he filed legal action against this podcast, 
[P142]  I think we would be in a world of hurt, and that legal liability is warranted. But the most powerful media companies in the world have Section 230 protection, so they have a business model where conspiracy theory or novel content, which is Latin for bullshit and lies, and the more angry it is, it gets elevated beyond its organic reach. So while I'm kind of down with the notion that we should have free speech and anybody should be able to say pretty much whatever they want, 
[P143]  There's something wrong when we have algorithms that have a profit incentive around rage, conspiracy theory, and lies, and two-thirds of Republicans believe that the election was stolen, when one in five Americans think that 9-11 was an inside job. Let's be honest. They thought that before the internet. I remember watching all the 9-11 truth of movies and all of that. But your point overall is right. I totally agree. 
[P144]  Wait, Elon agrees with you. When he bought X, he talked about the bot problem. He talked about the amplification of outrage. He hasn't done as much as I hoped he would have done so far, but I hope that they do address that because that isn't an Elon or an X problem. It's a technology problem of the modern world. The reality is that the more we live our lives online, the more you're going to have the problem of the ability of foreign governments, of individual people to create fake accounts, 
[P145]  bot farms, et cetera, to influence the way we look at all of these things. And we are going to have to come to terms with that reality because it's a technological issue that we're going to have to solve for and we haven't yet. It's also very easy for people to get caught in their own bubbles as well, which is a new phenomenon. There was a time where if you believed crazy things, you still had to sit next to someone else in church and talk to them about their life and what they believe. And you encountered dissenting voices. 
[P146]  encountered sane, rational people who had very different views to you that you had to be friends with long term. Whereas where we are right now is if you've got some sort of crazy view, you can find yourself only talking to people who share those views and only sharing content that reinforces those views until such time that you become extremely radicalized. I think that's such an important point because I think it's a real shame that AI LLMs aren't crawling the real world. I was at Granger's yesterday. Someone comes up to me. 
[P147]  Love your content. Let's take a picture. They're so nice. Another person comes up to me and says, I disagree with your view on this, but we have a civil conversation. And then I come home to 40 bots telling me I'm Professor Genocide. I mean, people in the real world, generally speaking, I don't know if it's because of the threat of physical violence, or they want to have sex with you, or maybe they think at some point you'll hire their kid, or generally just a comity of man. But people in real life, I find, are just lovely and wonderful. And it's a shame that these LLMs aren't calling this. 
[P148]  because the treif and some of the vile shit they're crawling online, which I don't even think reflects our species. I think it reflects technology that has a profit motive around promoting the most incendiary, hateful content. So there's got to be some sort of medium speed here. And also, I got off X, Steve, because you don't like Chick-fil-A, don't eat a Chick-fil-A. If Musk wants to pay $44 billion and turn it into a Nazi porn bar, that's his right. 
[P149]  illegal. I don't think the government should step in. But I don't have to paint his fence. And I can go to another platform. That's my right, too. And everyone says, oh, you're against free speech. I'm like, no, I'm not. I'm against being on a platform that makes me feel bad. So he has the right. And all this notion around meta, free speech, it's a little different because they control so much of the media. But these are media companies, and they should be liable for slander or defamation, the same way traditional media companies are in 
[P150]  I think we could solve a lot of this problem by just removing 230 protections for algorithmically elevated content. If you decide to elevate content beyond its organic reach, then you are making an editorial decision and you should be liable if that, in fact, is slanderous or defamatory. I think that's really fascinating as a way of handling it. And also, we're living in a world where, as of this year, some of the most phenomenal content you will read will be algorithmic. 
[P151]  generated and some of the most compelling content. So this idea that Scott's talking about, should bots have free speech? It sounds like a kind of, you know, intellectual kind of pseudo intellectual topic, but it's absolutely a very practical topic in the sense that bots now can generate conversations very easily. And some of the, you know, you could spend all day talking to a bot and not know. It's funny, this is this subject has come up because in the last week, I've had a flurry of messages on 
[P152]  WhatsApp from friends. I actually had two tweets yesterday, which you could probably see if you just search my name. Because on X at the moment, there's multiple ads running that are fake articles with fake BBC headlines with my face in. So it says things like, the Bank of England is suing Steve Bartlett. And this is running as a sponsored ad on X. And people are tweeting me these things. My friend says every time he refreshes the feed, he sees a new sponsored ad of a fake article of me. And sometimes it's like, can't believe this happened to Steve. And it's a BBC article. 
[P153]  you click on it, you get scammed. I think it's a crypto scam. I don't want to click. I'll send the link to you guys so you can click on it for me. But I just, it really has, because that is a bot. There's multiple of them, multiple accounts that have been spun up. They're all verified accounts. And it's AI generated imagery with a paid ad behind it. That's the bit that really gets me. I get people can post shit, but sponsoring it is a new level of defamation. One of the big macro things I've been thinking a lot about 
[P154]  haven't shared yet, is just the amount of social networks that have emerged. In the last 10 years, there's been a 50% increase so far in new social networks that have emerged. And we're seeing this splintering now of the rumbles, the blue skies, the threads. And it almost seems, talking about echo chambers, that social networks are becoming sort of political environments. And you're choosing your social network now based on your politics. This doesn't seem like a net positive thing for society. 
[P155]  argumentation of our reality. And it comes, you know, Scott's point about people behaving better in person is true. Although I would say there is the windscreen effect or the windshield effect, which is if someone cuts you up in traffic and you feel that there's some kind of physical separation between the two of you, most people behave slightly differently in that context than they would if they were sitting next to somebody face to face in a bar. So there's something about being physically present with other people that changes it, 
[P156]  one of the reasons, you know, I know you have pretty much all your interviews face to face and we do as well, because I generally speaking, it's very difficult to connect authentically with people. Obviously, we've managed to do it in the course of this conversation, but beyond that, it's difficult. And so we're going to have to work on that. But I just what the point I'm trying to make is this isn't a political issue. It's not an X issue. It's not an Elon Musk issue. It's a technological issue. We're living through 
[P157]  probably already have lived through most of the digital revolution. And I used to, as a kid, love Isaac Asimov science fiction books. And one of the reasons I did enjoy reading them so much is it was a world in which there was an exploration of what does the creation of robots, which is what we're living through, mean for morality? What does it mean for philosophy? What does it mean for humanity? What does it mean for, how do we build rules in a world 
[P158]  in which you have these machines that take every rule literally and suddenly you find that, you know, the desire to protect humanity results in the end of humanity. How do you navigate all of this? And that is what we're living through. We are also living through a period when our realities are being fragmented. And so we believe a very small set of things that other people like us somewhere in a very different part of the world, as Daniel was saying earlier, 
[P159]  believe, and we now live in this, we don't live in England or in Scotland or in America. We live almost like in a world of people who think like us in the West. And then other people live right next door to us who live in a whole different world because they consume a whole different set of information. That is the reality. We can complain about it. That is not going to change. And the only thing I really want to, 
[P160]  raise where I disagree with Scott about this idea that Facebook and X, et cetera, they are publishers and not platforms. I don't think you can apply the same media organization section to them. I don't think it's appropriate. They are platforms in which people publish information. The artificial amplification is a fair point. We need to deal with that. We need to deal with the bot problem. 
[P161]  That's a very difficult one because one of the challenges is the only way to really deal that I can see with the bot problem is to get people to verify their identity online. That obviously has a lot of questions around that because once you start forcing people to give their identity over to some anonymous blob online, who's collecting that data? What are they doing with it? 
[P162]  then the question for you is, well, you know, let's say right now I look at Twitter and I'm like, yeah, I'm happy to verify my identity. I'm happy to confirm who I am. Well, what if, you know, George Soros buys X off Elon at some point? Are you still happy that that information is being held? Are you still happy that the anonymous account you've now made confirmed? You know, what happens to the anonymous activists speaking about the Ayatollah's regime in Iran? 
[P163]  identity and the wrong person buys that platform or someone hacks it, et cetera. So it's a conversation that's not, if there were easier solutions on these issues, they would have been solved by now. This is a very difficult thing for humanity to navigate, and we're going to have to find a way to do it, and incrementally so. I just want to respond to that. I think you're guilty of the same illusion of complexity that protects these companies from acting like actors such that they can do anything regardless of the damage to the commonwealth to add shareholder value. 
[P164]  If you implemented, we have, first off, this notion that you don't want to give up your identity. Trust me, they know everything about you, Constantine, already. And I could go get a ton of information on you from the dark web fairly easily with a credit card. So the notion that somehow we shouldn't have some sort of, you could have, we need age verification for social media. There's no reason anyone in the age of 16 should be on a social media platform. And regarding the, 
[P165]  the civil rights activist or the women's rights activist that needs an anonymity, you could create a number of accounts and use blockchain or some sort of third-party anonymous to have a certain number of accounts that says, look, if you want an anonymous parody account, you want to make fun of people, fine. If you want an account talking about issues that you feel are sensitive from other markets, fine. We could absolutely figure that out and then figure out, okay, this account is doing nothing. It has no base. It has no soul. 
[P166]  values. It has 72 followers. All it's doing is trying to start fights online. All it's doing is trying to make people feel shitty about Britain or shitty about America. And the reality is these companies use that illusion of complexity such that they can have more bots creating more fake clicks, more Nissan ads, and more shareholder value. I think there's a middle ground here. I think we could figure this out. I agree. Well, that's what I'm saying. I think some of the ideas that you're putting forward, right or wrong, I don't know. 
[P167]  conversations we should be having. How do we make sure? I mean, my son is two and a half years old. And if my wife has become a complete screen Nazi, so he's probably not going to get a phone until he's about 40. But I think your point about people shouldn't be on social media. People shouldn't be on social media until they're 16. Absolutely correct. What that's doing to the minds of, well, or everybody, but particularly young people who are really susceptible to it. 
[P168]  The verification dimension is difficult, as I say. We're going to have to hash this all out as humanity. We're just going to have to work this all out. How do we live in this new world that we now live in? It's going to take some time. And I hope it's not as bad as the last time the information space was revolutionized, which was the printing press. That caused about two centuries of religious war. Hopefully we can avoid that. And part of the way to do that is to create environments which are uncensored, 
[P169]  People can express different ideas. We can have these battles and eventually come to some sort of mutual understanding. I hope that happens. What I wanted to ask you all to really close out this conversation was these conversations tend to be a bit of a reflection of what's in the news cycle and what's in the news cycle tends to be a reflection of what people are clicking. And a lot of that's driven by fear and the sort of narrative of the time, whether it's immigration or the Trump inauguration. But what is the big important idea that we're not talking about? 
[P170]  what's the most important thing that we should be talking about that isn't getting enough attention right now as it relates to the future of the West? And that's a big, broad question. I'll start with you, Daniel. For me, it's the schooling system. I think the schooling system is not preparing people for a world that exists and that we're teaching. You know, we haven't grasped the fact that AI is going to be the biggest, most disruptive technology in the lives of our children 
[P171]  into probably won't exist. We need to have a radical look at this idea that children should go to school with the same age groups or study a certain set of topics or that it should be topic-based at all. We need to explore, you know, are there better models for the schooling system that prepare people for the world that we're going to be in? Our current schooling system goes back to the early 1800s. 
[P172]  military schooling system in Prussia. And that's kind of where it evolved from. I think what we need to do is think about what are the, you know, what are the skills that our kids are going to need? I see too. And I can only, I don't feel like I can wrap my arms around UK's issues, but in terms of the US political extremism, I would put it number two, you know, at negative 40 Celsius and Fahrenheit meet. And because of our electoral system and Citizens United, people from the far left who are crazy and people from the 
[P173]  right who are crazy are just overrepresented. And they come together to meet on reckless spending, deficit spending. They come together to agree on anti-Semitism. And there's just too many people on the far left and the far right. And the people in the middle, it's minority rule. They're just not represented. However, I think the biggest threat that people aren't talking about, and I've actually spent some time talking with the administration around this, or the former administration, I should say, is loneliness. And that is, you have the deepest pocketed, most well-resourced 
[P174]  companies and people in the world trying to convince people, especially young men, that they can have a reasonable facsimile of life on a screen with an algorithm. And I think they literally go crazy. I think they wake up and they're obese and lonely and have no skills. We talked about this. I think young people, I say this jokingly, but seriously, I think young people need to get out of the house more, drink more, make a series of bad decisions that might pay off. I think we need more sex. I think we need more people in third spaces. 
[P175]  more church, more religious, more institutions, national service. We're mammals. And I worry that we're, one in seven men doesn't have a single friend. One in four men can't name a best friend. So this loneliness epidemic where people get into a bubble and start engaging in conspiracy theory, not trusting each other, blaming women, blaming the nation, self-harm. I just, I worry about, you know, when I say to young men, I coach a lot of young men, 
[P176]  15 minutes for a reason. This shit is hard and it's worth it. But I worry that we're raising, like I said, this new species of asocial, asexual being called the young American male that is obese, anxious, and just a shitty citizen. Constantine, the most important thing in 2025 that's not getting enough attention? In the UK and in most of Europe, it's an issue that Daniel raised earlier, which is in the UK, our energy prices are four times what they are in the United States. 
[P177]  That is an ideological decision. It's done because we're saving the planet. That's what we're being told. The reality is our contribution to global carbon emissions is we're responsible for 2% of global carbon emissions in the world. Making British pensioners freeze to death every winter because they can't afford fuel bills is not the solution to climate change. And if you amplify that further, 
[P178]  making our economy uncompetitive, making Britain unable to generate wealth for itself and for its future is not the moral position. Net zero, which is the impoverishment of our society for ideological reasons, has been positioned as the moral cause where we're saving the planet, we're ending climate change. We're not doing any of that. All we're doing is virtue signaling and making our fellow citizens suffer. So what we should be talking about is how do we make energy cheap, again, 
[P179]  so that we can have a prosperous economy. And guess what? When people are prosperous, that's when they actually start being responsible about pollution, about throwing away things they don't need. And also, when you have money, that's when you can invest money in scientific research, which allows you to find cleaner, better forms of energy. That's what we should be doing. We should be making sure that we generate as much wealth for our fellow citizens as possible, because a lot of people are struggling. 
[P180]  deeply, deeply immoral to impoverish already poor pensioners in this country and to prevent businesses from hiring people and giving them jobs and opportunities, including the young men that Scott is talking about, because we are saving the planet and we're trying to keep little Greta happy. We're not doing any of that. We're not successful in that. We should stop pretending and we should do what Donald Trump said he plans to do, which is drill baby drill. We should be exploring and exploiting all the energy reserves 
[P181]  this country in order to create clean energy and better forms of energy for the future, as well as to improve the well-being of our fellow citizens. That's what we should be talking about a hell of a lot more than we are. You need cheap energy. You're right. It's what I would argue. I think it's going to be liquid, natural gas and nuclear. We haven't talked about AI. AI requires 10 times the energy. The AI query is a Google query. The choke point is energy. I would argue in the US, I think we'd benefit more from as opposed 
[P182]  The drill, baby, drill, build, baby, build. I think young people have seen housing prices just go crazy. There's a psychological benefit to household formation, forced savings. So I'm going to take your word because you're a very smart guy that Britain has implemented a series of policies. That energy stat you rolled out was incredible. But in the U.S., like I said, I don't want to say we're drowning in oil. There were more drilling permits issued under Biden. 
[P183]  than the previous Trump admitted. I mean, just to call Biden anti-energy or that somehow we have this massively overinflated energy prices, it's just not, that hasn't happened in the US. I would like, we need more homes in the US. And in the UK too. And Stephen, let me just, before you wrap up, fill the stats out a little bit more. Obviously, everyone understands that geopolitically we're in a pretty tense time and there's conflicts happening. 
[P184]  Britain is in a position now where we would struggle. You've got to remember British history. Britain is, Britannia rules the waves, right? The way that Britain has become a great nation throughout history is by having a powerful fleet. We would struggle to build warships now because we've closed down all our steelworks because we're green, right? It's insanity. And on every other issue to do with energy and industry, we have basically deliberately moved our production 
[P185]  facilities to other countries. Okay, great idea. Globalization, make things cheaper, ship things, but wonderful. Okay, what happened during COVID? What happened when suddenly the entire chains of production weren't quite operating the way that they normally do? Oh, China's suddenly hoarding all the masks. Interesting. So what do you think is going to happen when there's a war? Or they're just going to keep shipping the steel to us to make the battleships and the warplanes that we need to fight them? That's what you think is going to happen? This whole thing, this whole agenda is ideological, 
[P186]  And what Ed Miliband is about to do to this country when it comes to this issue needs to talk about way more. And it is about economic prosperity. It is about housing, because one of the reasons we don't build as much housing as we need to is, again, building housing produces emissions. And we don't want to be not green. So that's why people in their 30s and 40s are now living in flat shares for four people. We have got to let go of this obsession with net zero. We have got to build. We have got to drill. 
[P187]  We have got to produce energy and we have got to stop thinking that the moral thing to do is to make our poor citizens suffer in order that we feel good about saving the planet, which we're not even remotely saving by doing this. Guys, thank you so much for all of your perspective. One of the things I realised as you guys were talking is that you're all fathers and you're all fathers of boys, although you're fathers of boys at different ages. So I wanted to just give you all 30 seconds if you could. 
[P188]  self for this advice but based on everything that's happening in the world which can feel incredibly confusing especially to young people where we're getting a lot of our information from different echo chambers what is the advice that you would all give to your young boys that would best prepare them for the future in the next couple of years starting with you Dan yeah so I've got a six-year-old daughter a seven-year-old son and a 
[P189]  them for a world that's fast changing is difficult. We're taking the approach of a lot of general knowledge across a lot of things so that you can use AI to run deep in different topics. We're encouraging the kids to interact with supervised AI conversations and letting them know that that technology is available. We're also just focusing on some manual skills, like how to fix a boiler and how to saw through some wood. 
[P190]  you know, those kind of things. And also we're doing things like acting classes, being up on a stage and performing. So all of those kind of typical things. But to be honest, it is a point of anxiety in my life just thinking about what, you know, what the world looks like for, you know, 10 or 15 years from now that they're going to be going into. So if you get clear answers on this, I'm really open to learning. 
[P191]  For me, my son is two and a half, so it's a little bit early for this pep talk. But my message to him when he's old enough to hear it is going to be this. Your grandfather, your great-grandfather, my grandfather, was taken as a slave laborer from Soviet Ukraine to Nazi Germany. Your great-grandfather was born, your great-grandmother, rather, was born in the Soviet Gulag. Your great-grandmother lived through the German occupation 
[P192]  Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. You are not living in the worst time ever. You're surrounded by pussies. If you are a man and if you do your job and if you learn the skills that you need to do and if you pursue the things that you want to do with your life to the best of your ability, if you believe in yourself, if you believe that you're talented, if you actually achieve the things that you set your mind to, there's never been a better time in the history of humanity than now. You're surrounded mostly by people who feel sorry for themselves, 
[P193]  If you're not one of them, you're going to clean up. Young women are looking for a young man like you who's actually going to stand up for himself, who's actually going to go out there and achieve and be confident. Be that and you're going to clean up when it comes to finding the right partner for yourself. You're going to clean up when it comes to making money. You're going to clean up when it comes to your career. You're going to clean up on every front because the bar has never been lower. The bar has never been lower. So just go out and be a man and life is going to be great. 
[P194]  I'm older. I have 14 and 17 year old boys. And my observation is you can't tell them anything. The best you can do is you can try and model behavior for them. So I'm trying to be really kind to their mother. I'm trying to show them that, you know, if you're serious about having a good family, you got to be a generous, loving partner. I'm trying to be in great physical shape, which is getting harder and harder. I'm trying to be aggressive around them in terms of business. 
[P195]  business and trying to be kind. And what I do, I do talk to them about the concept of surplus value. I'm like, you're takers right now. You know, the UK school system, which is amazing, is investing a lot in you and you're giving almost nothing back. Me and your mother are loving you a lot more than you're loving us. You're just taking resources everywhere. You're a net negative. And you're crossing the manhood isn't sex or some religious ceremony. You're crossing the manhood is when 
[P196]  you are start creating surplus value. You're loving more people than you're absorbing. You're listening to more complaints than you are complaining. You're creating more revenue than you're absorbing. That's the notion. It's surplus value. And I have this trick called what a man does. And I've been doing this when they're kids. I'm like, guests show up. A man goes and gets their luggage and puts it in their room. A man is constantly scanning the table for empty water glasses. And I mean, one of the proudest moments I ever had was when I'm like, 
[P197]  my six-year-old boy who was all like 30 pounds got up and went over this gigantic pitcher of water at this table and like started like trying to pour other people's water and everyone had no idea what was going on here. You know, I do these things called what a man does. A man goes up to, a man asks a woman out for coffee. A man pays for women. I'm a sexist that way. I still have told my men, my son gave me this rap on, oh dad, you're so establishment. I'm like, do you ever want to have sex? 
[P198]  I'm like, then you need to pay. I mean, that's the bottom line. Anyways, but what I would say is I'm trying to model. I'm trying to model good behavior or be a good role model. But I agree with Constantine and Daniel. I think every day they have more potential to lead the most amazing life in history. I'm not a nihilist. I'm not a catastrophist. I think I have big problems. But given the blessings of the sons born to these, 
[P199]  men and future you know future sons that you'll have steven jesus it's good to be them there's just they have no excuse they should they should they should rock on they should have a wonderful life constantine scott daniel thank you so much for taking the time um at sort of short notice to talk about all these subjects it's incredibly wide-ranging conversation and you'll bring such an interesting hilarious nuanced perspective to these issues i'm glad that we can have these conversations and disagree in a respectful way that hopefully clarifies a lot of the confusion that i 
[P200]  experience and a lot of people are experiencing at the moment so thank you to all of you i'm going to link to all of your work on the screen i know scott you've got a book coming on masculinity which we're all very very excited about we've been waiting it's long overdue please hurry up um constantine you've got an incredible podcast with trigonometry which i'm going to link on the screen and i suggest everybody goes and listens to and subscribes to if they're looking for more of this stuff and daniel you've just been on my show already but your endless amount of books and i think the best place to get more from you is your website of course uh your the daniel priestly website where you can find all of your books and all of your work and everything you're doing there 
[P201]  Thank you, everybody. Really, really appreciative and incredibly grateful for taking part in our first little experiment of this kind. So, yeah, thank you.

[P1] ﻿ The world is absolutely crazy right now. This is one of the most interesting moments of social, cultural and economic transition that I have ever seen. So I wanted to do something that I've never done before. I called upon three of the leading voices on social, cultural, business and economic issues to give their unfiltered, uncensored points of view so that we can all make sense of all of this craziness happening before our eyes. They don't always agree on much, but today they thrash it out to see if they can agree on something. 
[P2]  Go through the economy, Trump, Elon Musk, EEI, censorship, wokeism, and why so many men are struggling. Why are tens of thousands of millionaires running away from the UK? The terrifying truth and opportunity in AI. And I ask all of them, what is the most important thing in 2025 that nobody is talking about? With the aim of reaching clarity, agreement, and having a laugh in the process. This is the episode you probably didn't know you needed. 
[P3]  When we look at the back end of Spotify and Apple and our audio channels, the majority of people that watch this podcast haven't yet hit the follow button or the subscribe button, wherever you're listening to this. I would like to make a deal with you. If you could do me a huge favour and hit that subscribe button, I will work tirelessly from now until forever to make the show better and better and better and better. I can't tell you how much it helps when you hit that subscribe button. The show gets bigger, which means we can expand the production, bring in all the guests you want to see and continue to doing this thing we love. If you could do me that small favour and hit the follow button, 
[P4]  wherever you're listening to this, that would mean the world to me. That is the only favour I will ever ask you. Thank you so much for your time. Back to this episode. You guys are three of the best commentators, the most articulate people I know that also have the most interesting, broad experience and also I think political background. So I wanted to talk to you about everything that's going on in the world. And I wanted to ask you guys some of the dumb questions that I ponder alone with myself and with my dumb friends in my WhatsApp group. 
[P5]  It feels to me that the world is at a real moment of transition in many regards. So like social transition, cultural transition, economic transition. And I think the US has been a catalyst for all of that. So that's why I wanted to have this conversation today. We've got an American here, Scott. I think Scott's the only American here. We've got Constantine. We've got Daniel, who are two Brits, but spend a lot of time between America as well. And so I want to come to Scott first and ask Scott a question, which is a very big, broad question, 
[P6]  your perspective, Scott, you know, when I talk about this feeling of transition, that seems to be like almost inside my chest, that we're at a really historic moment. What is your analysis on this? What is the big picture here? What's happened over the last three, four, five, six, seven months? And how is that going to impact all of us around the world? Well, if you think of the US as setting the tone economically, and maybe even culturally for the West, there's definitely a reversion away from 
[P7]  people feel that quote-unquote wokeism, and I don't like to use that word, but I'll use it here, was this sort of overcorrection to systemic racism and that it began to cause more damage than it was or cause more problems than it was solving. And I think there's been a serious kind of lurch back, if you will, whether it's executive actions declaring the border, a state of emergency, stuff around saying that gender is a thing, 
[P8]  and female. And most of these issues, the actually American public supports, I would say on a more cynical level, America used to be a platform for prosperity, the protection of civil rights, the projection of women's rights and power and democracy abroad. And I would argue that it feels like a pretty quick transition to almost like a, you know, I call it a kleptocracy, but America has become a platform for 
[P9]  acquiring wealth and then leveraging that wealth as a means or a proxy of power. And the ultimate example of that was the launch of two meme coins, the Trump coin and the Melania coin, the day before the presidency, such that this conversation could have already or might happen this week. And I'll finish here. President Trump, it's Vlad. We're thinking about stabilizing our currency or trying to send the outflows of our reserves. 
[P10]  into the Trump coin, which, based on my economist estimation, would take the value of it to a $20 or $30 billion market cap, making you one of the wealthiest men in the world, Mr. Trump. And none of this would be disclosable or transparent. Also, in unrelated news, we'd really appreciate you seizing arms shipments to Ukraine. So I think we've gone kind of full kleptocracy is the way I would describe it. Are you optimistic, Scott? Well, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. 
[P11]  I don't know if I'm just getting older, but no, I don't see a man convicted of sexual abuse or found liable who inspired an insurrection retaking the White House as a point of light for the American experience. Constantine, I suspect you'd have a slightly different view on all of the above. How are you feeling about everything that happened yesterday? Did you watch the inauguration? What is your big picture, 30,000 feet view? 
[P12]  make bold predictions about what's going to happen over the next six to seven months. I do think what America had at the election and what the election of Donald Trump represents is something that we in the UK don't have, which is choice. They had a very clear choice between two very different perspectives on the world, between two very different approaches, between two very different candidates. And ultimately, criticisms of President Trump are necessary and legitimate. Of course they are. 
[P13]  But at the end of the day, I believe having spent quite a lot of time in America around election time and also just generally and traveling around real America, not just in D.C. and L.A. and New York. The reason that he was elected was that the American people are not prepared to accept what Europeans have decided they're prepared to accept, which is managed decline. The American people do not want their country to become weaker. They do not want it to become poorer. 
[P14]  impoverish their fellow citizens through net zero. What they want is their country to be great, their country to be powerful, their country to be influential. The economic realities for most Americans are not really reflected in the figures that we are told. So when people talk about inflation, the reality of people's lives on the ground is that their cost of living has gone up very, very significantly over the last few years. 
[P15]  overall inflation figure that we're shown because certain things are much more influential in people's lives than others. And so whether the decision to elect President Trump ends up being this positive thing for which there should be lots of optimism is a matter of the next four years. Are we going to see a presidency that really does everything it promises? And by the way, you know, if you look at the things that Donald Trump is promising, 
[P16]  Whether you're left or right, you have to acknowledge that they are things that are worth doing. Having a secure border so that people don't come into your country illegally is a basic duty of government. Economic prosperity is a basic duty of government. Withdrawing America from a kind of simultaneously aggressive but weak posture around the world where America sort of says, yeah, yeah, we're going to get involved in these foreign conflicts, 
[P17]  win that war is a kind of stupid position on both whichever side you're on. So on all of these things, and of course, you know, Scott mentioned wokeness. I think he's absolutely right that there is a massive backlash happening around the world because lots and lots of people who were completely apolitical until the last three or four years or maybe until 2016 just feel like the world has gone crazy and suddenly they're supposed to pretend that men can change sex and become women and now they're 
[P18]  entitled to be in female prisons. And, you know, if your teenager says that they are the opposite sex, you're supposed to chop their breasts off and all of this other stuff that ordinary people just look at and go, this is crazy. Like, I am liberal, but this isn't liberal. This is some kind of weird thing that's going on. And I see the backlash against all of that all over the Western world. And I think Donald Trump signifies that people are fed up of that. 
[P19]  that if the woke left continues to exercise this level of influence on our public debate, the reaction will be the rise of the right. And Donald Trump is one of the most diplomatic and pleasant versions of what you're likely to get if the left keeps going crazy. We will see what challenges the world throws at him over the next four years and whether he's capable of responding to them. 
[P20]  left lost its way in your view? And if so, how did that happen? And just to respond on some of Constantine's points about Trump being the best of a sort of right-wing collective, are we going to see right-wing sort of ideology spread throughout the Western world over the coming years? What's your take on all of the above? You definitely, you know, we Democrats, we get it right and then we just go too damn far. And so I look at, I'm a professor on a campus, 
[P21]  DEI, 60 years ago, there were 12 black people at Princeton, Yale, and Harvard combined. That was a problem. Race-based affirmative action makes sense. This year, more than half of Harvard's freshman class identifies as non-white. But 70% of those non-whites come from dual-income homes in the upper quintile of income-earning homes. The academic gap between black and white used to be double what it was between rich and poor. It's now flipped. So DEI was a good idea that, quite frankly, has gone insane 
[P22]  system it was trying to do away with. And then we created two candidates who were the only candidates who could make each other viable. Vice President Harris, given the hand she dealt with, did the best she did. I think President Biden should be buried in a crypt entitled narcissist who decided that it made sense for him to go back on his pledge to be a transition candidate and gave us a British-style election timing on the Democratic side in a marketplace. 
[P23]  or you need time and money. So it was not, we did not have a great candidate. There is an understandable swing back from what is an overcorrection around some of these issues. You know, parents, we gave them a huge issue with transgender rights. There's more Padel players in California than transgender people. And yet the Democrats decided to conflate it with the civil rights movement and think that it was okay for a woman who transitioned, a transgender woman, 
[P24]  enter a bicycle race and finish five minutes before everybody else, and then we all bark up the same tree and decide that it's inspiring. And parents all over the nation are saying, we've literally gone crazy. Where I would disagree a little bit with Constantine is that America choosing economic growth and prosperity, there are 190 sovereign nations in the world. 189 would change places with America over the last four years. We hit 71 new record highs in the markets, 97% of all AI. We've created more market capitalization 
[P25]  in a seven-mile radius of SFO International Airport than Europe's created in the last 20 years. We have the lowest inflation in the G7. We have the highest growth. We've grown 10% since 2020. That's triple the rate of Europe. Biden was unable to communicate any of that effectively because there's this psychological dynamic that when your wages go up, you credit your own grit and character, and when the price of cereal goes up, you blame the president. Now, similar to the future, or how William Gibson described the future, 
[P26]  It's here. It's just not evenly distributed. Prosperity is unprecedented in the U.S. over the last four years. It just wasn't evenly distributed. Now, having said that, in America, you can stop working in August and you've produced more and made more money than you have in Europe the whole year. And it has gotten better. It says things are less bad than anywhere in the world in the U.S. Biden was unable to communicate it. And then talking about how great the economy is when rents were skyrocketing, tuition was going up, it was an ineffective strategy. 
[P27]  But I don't think it's fair to say Americans chose prosperity. We have prosperity. 
[P28]  My favorite appointment in the Trump administration in the adult room is the 10 year bond, which is going to say, sorry, girlfriend, when I believe the president tries to implement some of these economic policies. Constantine, is that true? Because what I heard there is that effectively Trump had a better marketing campaign. And that reality is somewhat different from what the Americans were sold in the last election cycle. Well, politics is about marketing and Trump is the marketer in chief. 
[P29]  and partly that's what politics is about. But in terms of the economy, I think Scott is entirely right. It's one of the reasons I admire America so much, the sense of dynamism and economic growth and the desire to create things and build things. It's an observation I've had every time I've been there. You know, if you have a successful restaurant in the UK, you go, well, I've got a successful restaurant. In America, if you have a successful restaurant, you open a second one and a third one and you create a chain, right? So their attitude to business more broadly is, 
[P30]  is fantastic and I love it. But I think the difference is that I don't think Americans were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the European economies. They were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the American economy under Donald Trump in his first term and also what they expect him to do for the future. When they look at the fact that he's got real business leaders in government now, like Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk talking about government efficiency, 
[P31]  all Western countries have a massively bloated civil service, what we call civil service in the UK and the administrative state in the US that wastes a huge amount of money, that produces very little in terms of output in many cases. And that needs to be slimmed down. And people, I think, are very excited about that. And when I talk to business leaders in America, including ones that were never on the Trump train, so to speak, so many of them went over to his side in this election cycle. 
[P32]  because they just felt that he was going to continue to accelerate American growth and continue to deliver prosperity for the American people. Now, Scott's point about tariffs and all of these other things, you know, I've listened to Donald Trump enough now to know that you should not necessarily be taking him literally. I think many of the things he says are negotiation tactics and signaling. 
[P33]  build this or do that or do this. You have to sort of read between the lines when he says, you know, this will be the worst thing that you just go. He's saying to people like, you better work with me. Otherwise, this is going to work out badly for you on all of these things. And so it remains to be seen whether he's successful in those tactics of getting what he wants. Look, America is always going to be an unequal society. It's designed in a way that is going to make it that way. In America, the focus is how do we grow the pie? 
[P34]  In Europe, the focus is how do we divide it up so everyone gets their fair little share, right? So Americans are about expanding the pie and then the people who bake the pie get as much of it as they possibly can. But the question is, can there be a sense in America that the American dream is alive, that you do not have to work three gig economy jobs to pay your rent, that you're going to be able to buy a house, that you're going to be able to afford to have children, 
[P35]  raise a family, perhaps on a single income, something that most people only dream about nowadays. That's really what this whole economic conversation is about. And we will see over the next four years if Donald Trump is able to slightly even change the direction of travel towards those things that actually Americans of my generation and older used to take for granted as the promise of the country that they live in. I've thought a lot about this over the last couple of weeks in particular, 
[P36]  papers in the UK that millionaires are leaving the UK in historic numbers. I think it's 10,800 millionaires left last year, which is an increase of about 160% versus the previous year. And the general sentiment in terms of business confidence in the UK is at a several year low. So I think it's the lowest it's been since just post pandemic. There's this, I think it's the Institute of Accountants, they call up 1000 accountants every year, and they get they run a survey to see how much confidence 
[P37]  they have in business in this country. And it's fallen 14 points to 0.2% confidence in terms of business. But there's this bigger narrative emerging amongst my entrepreneurial friends that if you want to start a business right now, the best place to be in the world is to be in America, is to get over to America and to leave the UK. Now, Dan, how does that score? I know you have an accelerator, you speak to lots of entrepreneurs. How does that sort of compare or contrast with what you're seeing at the moment? Yeah, 100%. The value proposition for the UK has dropped through the floor. 
[P38]  Very, very high tax. The ecosystem of business is in decline. Some of the smartest people are now in Dubai. Some incredible creators that I know have moved to Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai. Many are going to the USA. So if people are interested in bigger markets and bigger opportunities, they're into the USA. If they're interested in lower tax and more fringe opportunities, they're in the Middle East. 
[P39]  a place in the world. I think there are three business models the UK could go for, which is either the head office of Europe, which is what we were when we were inside the EU, and everyone used to come here to build a European business. We could be the back office of the USA, so the incubator for the USA. A lot of smart companies get to their first 50 million of value here in the UK and then sell to a US private equity firm or US listed company. 
[P40]  And a lot of US companies are now actually coming here to poach talent or to outsource things to the UK more cheaply than they could do it in the US. The wages in the UK are through the floor compared to what you would pay in the US, especially in tech roles. So very smart people in the UK are massively devalued. 
[P41]  tax, model of Dubai, Singapore, you know, those kind of options. So we haven't really picked one of those three yet. We're still, you know, all these years after Brexit, and we haven't said which of those three models we want to adopt. Scott, you moved here a couple of years ago to the UK. And despite everything that's going on in the UK, are you still bullish on this being a place for entrepreneurship and business? I was looking at some stats 
[P42]  of key areas of concern for me. Business stats I've talked about there, the drop in business confidence, the entrepreneur exodus that we're seeing, but things like knife crime in the UK are up 81% over the last decade, which I think is a symptom probably of something else. And one of the big things I think a lot about as an entrepreneur at the moment is artificial intelligence. And our investment in artificial intelligence from a global perspective is down about 2000% versus a country like America. So you've moved here, you've brought your family here. 
[P43]  bullish on the UK versus the US from an entrepreneur's perspective? So the question I get most frequently when I speak here is to compare and contrast the US with the UK. And I use a personal anecdote. My parents immigrated to the US from Glasgow and London when they were 19 and 22. They took enormous risks. I've been an entrepreneur my whole life. I like to think that a lot of my success isn't my fault, that I inherited sort of that risk-taking DNA. And when I speak to people in the UK, I say the primary difference is 
[P44]  And that is, it kind of comes down to a risk appetite. The U.S. has five times per capita the number of entrepreneurs. It has five times the dollar volume per startup. There's $5 million in venture capital waiting to be deployed for every startup in the U.S. versus $1 million in Europe. I love what Constantine said about a restaurant. I went into this great little restaurant in Soho a few weeks ago called Dig In, and I loved it so much. I left my card and said, can you have the owner? 
[P45]  I'd like to open another one. Does he need money? I just would never do that here. I thought that was a really interesting insight. And the collision of risk, crazy ideas that occasionally become crazy genius and technology and intellectual property and great universities results in a company that no one had heard of five years ago being worth more than the entire UK stock market, NVIDIA. So there's just an enormous difference. 
[P46]  my impression of the UK economy, I'll just say London. I have no experience in it. I don't go anywhere that's not walking distance from Marlebone. So my bubble is pretty opaque. But the way I would describe the economy here is I love the term the butler economy. And that is all the money I see being made here is people servicing wealth created somewhere else. You're either in financial services servicing rich people. You're either opening a restaurant or hospitality. 
[P47]  quality servicing rich people, but I don't see a lot of organic wealth creation. I interviewed the two, quote unquote, inventors of AI at one of your prestigious universities. My first question is, how the hell were you not able to make any money if you invented AI? Why haven't you been able to capture any money? But just for your listeners, my summation of Europe versus the US after molesting the earth for the last 35 years is US is still the best place to make money and Europe is still the best place to spend it. Is this a failing nation, Scott? 
[P48]  I think you have too much going for you to be described as a failing nation. You still have amazing universities. London's still the second best city in the world. Premier League, it's an unbelievable export. I know how ridiculous that sounds. People want to be here. There's still rule of law, rule of play. You still produce amazing rock and roll. I just don't see how you could say this is a failed. I would argue that second only to our entry into Iraq, 
[P49]  An American can't understand why you would decide to increase your prices while reducing productivity in one fell swoop. It's difficult for us to wrap our heads around some of the economic decisions the UK has made. But I think a lot of people are kind of betting or hoping that the UK begins to grow again. So in a weird way, I would call myself cautiously optimistic about the UK. I think at some point it registers. 
[P50]  it begins to occupy the place it should command, if you will. Constantine, I would ask the same question to you as well. Do you think the UK is a failing nation? And Scott describes self-inflicted wounds there. I've heard you speak of self-inflicted wounds when you talk more broadly about the West and what the West needs to do to turn itself around. And also just layering a third point on top of that, which is somewhat linked to this, is Elon Musk has taken a particular interest in the UK over the last month in particular. 
[P51]  started to describe it online, it seems, as a failing nation. What's your view? Well, I'm glad you asked me about Elon Musk, because the thing that I love most about the media having this massive meltdown about, oh, no, these Americans are interfering in our political... These are the same media commentators who are constantly banging on about American politics and saying, Donald Trump needs to do this, you need to vote for this. Like, all of this stuff is ridiculous. The reality is we download our culture, our politics, 
[P52]  almost everything from America, right? America has become what Britain used to be, which is the center of Western civilization. And my request and ask and begging of British people is, if we're going to download American culture and politics, let's at least take the good stuff instead of all this terrible woke shit that we downloaded from them, the DEI and all this other nonsense, and actually take the entrepreneurial spirit and all these other things that are really great about America, the optimism, 
[P53]  the positivity, the willingness to have a go, to take a risk, as Scott was talking about. So I wish we took more of that. And it speaks to your question about are we a failing nation? Look, I think it's a deliberately inflammatory question, which I don't want to kind of actually accept in that way. But what I think we should acknowledge is are we trending up or are we trending down? And when you talk about over 10,000 millionaires, 
[P54]  have left. I hear that through a normal British person's ear. And I worry that there's quite a lot of British people who will hear that and say, oh, good, all of these rich parasites have left. Because that's our attitude in the UK to a very large extent. We see wealthy people not as what they are, which is for the most part, not everybody, but for the most part, people who've created a tremendous amount of value for their fellow human beings. And as a result of that, 
[P55]  have been rewarded. We see them because we, you know, we have this history of the landed gentry. And so to us, a millionaire is someone who has these ill-gotten gains that they don't deserve, right? That is not really the world we live in. When I talk to wealthy people in this country and pretty much everywhere else, for the most part, especially in the Western world, these are people who've created something that has fundamentally helped other human beings do something better, do something easier, 
[P56]  products, cheaper, whatever it is. That's who the successful people really are. And we just need an attitude shift. That's what we should be downloading from America. What we should be saying inside our heads is this person is successful because they've helped other people. Great. How do we get more of those people into our country? And I'm afraid I'm telling you something that you know better than anyone, Stephen. If you don't have entrepreneurs in your country creating businesses and creating jobs, 
[P57]  eternity. We have to get smart, talented, driven people into our country instead of chasing them out. Dan, I know this is a subject that you're very passionate about, and Konstantin's articulated it really, really well. I've seen lots of your posts about this subject, Dan. What are you seeing? And is it true that the British attitude is a form of self-harm that's holding us back from our potential? There are definitely attitudinal factors, but you'll also get the most incredibly entrepreneurial people here in London. London is a melting pot for 
[P58]  creativity. You've got sitting in one city, you've got people who are phenomenal at media, finance, technology, entertainment, politics, defense, like all of this. Like if you take the best of LA and Washington and New York and Miami and kind of start moving it into one city, you know, you get elements of that in London. It's a very diverse city from that point of view, and it creates an entrepreneurial melting pot. The issue is taxes. Nobody wants to pay 
[P59]  60% of their income in taxes. And as soon as you hit, you know, in the US, you don't hit the top tax rate until you are six times the average wage. Here in the UK, it's two and a half times. So as soon as you're two and a half times the average wage, you're in real trouble. There are so many people in the UK who deliberately hold their income at £50,000 because after £50,000, you get taxed 40% of your income. So people just give up and they say, I'm not going, I know some 
[P60]  really smart, really talented people who could be earning a lot more and they refuse to pay the 40% rate. So they like keep everything small because they don't want to go from 20 to 40% at the 50 grand rate, which is crazy. And I've employed people who have said, can I have a day off a week rather than going over that threshold? So, you know, that's a huge issue, the tax issue. The company rate tax is high. The corporate capital gains rate is taxed very high. The VAT is high. 
[P61]  The council tax is high. All of these additional taxes just keep piling up. And then the other cost at the moment, if we want to have an AI economy, we need cheap electricity. One thing that Trump has committed to is really, really cheap energy. There is no such thing as a fast growth, high octane economy that has expensive energy. Cheap energy equals fast growth. And we have the most expensive energy in the world. 
[P62]  Scott, you look like a lot of thoughts are going through your head following those two comments. What are you thinking? 
[P63]  that we have a housing crisis and that the executive order should have been around that. Just going back to the U.S., and I'm curious of the same dynamics and whether Constantine and Daniel agree with us. I believe this, the election in the U.S. was supposed to be a referendum on women's rights. Women's rights did not show up. This was a referendum on young men, in my view. And that is, if you look at the two cohorts that swung most from blue to red versus 2020, two of the three cohorts, other than Latinos, 
[P64]  was people under the age of 30 who in the U.S. are 24% less wealthy than they were 40 years ago, people over the age of 70 or 72% wealthier. Our tax code is basically an attempt to shove money from the young to the old. And two, 45 to 64-year-old women who I would affectionately describe as their mother. And that is when your son's in the basement vaping and playing video games, and I think a lot about struggling young men, you don't give a flying fuck about territorial sovereignty in the Ukraine, or Ukraine, excuse me, or transgender rights. 
[P65]  is your kid isn't doing well. And 210 times a day, your kid's getting a notification that somebody he knows is on a Gulfstream or partying in St. Bart's and it's not him or her. And so we not only have young people not doing as well, this pornographic wealth is just shoved in their face. And you end up with, in my opinion, kind of a young, struggling young man. No group has fallen further faster in the world, I would argue, than young men in America. 
[P66]  a morgue in the United States and there's five people who died by suicide, four of them are men. One in three men under the age of 30 has a girlfriend. Two in three women under the age of 30 has a boyfriend. Why? You think that's mathematically impossible? Because women are dating older because they want more economically and emotionally viable men. There's one in five men live at home at the age of 30. One in three under the age of 25. They're not having sex. They're more obese. They're more depressed. When women don't have a relationship, they oftentimes channel that energy 
[P67]  into their professional lives. More single women own homes in the U.S. than single men. Women in urban areas under the age of 30 are making more money than men. When men don't have the guardrails of a relationship or a job or being in school, they pour that energy sometimes into unproductive things, misogyny, nationalism or extreme nationalism, conspiracy theory. In some, they become really shitty citizens. They become sequestered from society. So I'm worried in the U.S., our biggest threat is a new species of asexual. 
[P68]  asocial young men who are incredibly dangerous have opted out of America. 60% of 30-year-olds used to have one child in America, and that's 27%. So people, I think, in the U.S., and this is a genuine question. I don't know if it's the same problem here. Our tax policies have taken money from the young, stuffed them in the pockets of old people so Nana and Pop-Pop can upgrade from Carnival to Crystal Cruises. Meanwhile, young people can't afford education. They can't afford housing. 
[P69]  And we especially see this really acute emerging crisis among young men who are just opting out of America, who don't even want to try and date, don't even want to enroll in school, don't want to even try and get a job, just stick in their basements and go on Reddit or Discord, or why go try and shower or work out and get a relationship when you have you porn? Why get a job when you can trade stocks or crypto on Coinbase or Robinhood? 
[P70]  In my opinion, this is the most dangerous trend in America right now. It was almost like demonizing men for decades has consequences. I mean, this is what's been happening. Men are the root of all evil, the root of all evil, the root of all evil. Every advert is about, you know, the woman is strong and capable. The guy's pathetic. In every movie, the woman's kicking ass and the man is pathetic. This has been going on for decades. It's a cultural thing as well as an economic thing. 
[P71]  meaning and opportunity away from men. If you create an education system that punishes boys for being boys, if you create a society in which traditional masculine virtues become vices, then you will create exactly the sort of thing that Scott is talking about. It's a terrible thing that's been done. Having said that, my message is always the same to young men who I hope are listening, which is the answer to your problems is never going to be, as Scott says, porn and this and that. 
[P72]  the answer to your problems is going to take responsibility, go out and get a job or create a business and actually make your life better. No one's coming to save you. No one's coming to help you. There is no, the sort of programs that we have for women where we sort of go, well, you know, let's give them an opportunity here. None of that's happening for men. It's not going to happen because for evolutionary reasons, we just don't feel sorry for men the way that we do for women. That's a reality. I know it sucks, 
[P73]  men is going to be the answer that's always been the answer for men, which is for you to get off the sofa, to get off the couch and go out and actually do and create and build and find your own way through it. Even if you have to acknowledge that the society you live in has been conditioned for quite a long time to think that you're a piece of shit because you happen to have the genitalia that you do. Now, that I think is the harsh reality of it. And I think Scott is right to point this out as a problem. And I hope that we start to have 
[P74]  both in terms of economic policy, but in terms of also just the cultural conversations and the way we talk about these issues, we come back to something that human beings have known through the entire history of our species, which is men and women are both good and need to work together in order to thrive and succeed together, in order to have families, in order to have children, and in order for us to have healthy communities and healthy societies. You need healthy femininity and you need healthy masculinity, and they need to come together and work together. 
[P75]  Together, that's what we're supposed to do. And these stupid gender wars and this idea that men as a group are this and women as a group are that, all of that just needs to end. I was watching last night as Trump sat there signing all of those executive orders. And I also watched his inauguration speak where he said, we will forge a society that is colourblind and merit-based. And he signed a bunch of executive orders last night to eliminate a variety of different DEI programmes in the federal government, 
[P76]  We've seen 
[P77]  whack DEI measures. So I think there's a lot of nuance here. I would argue in universities, DEI is used as a giant misdirect from people such as myself who are enforcers of the caste system and wake up every morning and look in the mirror and ask ourselves the same question. How do I increase my compensation while decreasing my accountability? And what I found is the ultimate strategy is to create an LVMH rejectionist bullshit, elitist strategy, where Dartmouth sits on a 
[P78]  endowment of $8 billion and lets in 500 kids. So the conversation around who gets in is a misdirect from the important question that is how many. If you are not growing your endowment or your freshman class faster than population, you should lose your tax-free status. We should be letting in more gay kids, more trans kids, more white Republicans from rural state. You know who doesn't talk about DEI? Junior colleges, because there's no admissions. They don't have a problem with DEI. 
[P79]  own tail, started out with the right idea. Now it's nothing. And I would argue the same is somewhat true of the Democratic Party. I went to the Democratic National Convention. On the dnc.org website, it lists 17 special introscripts, and it says explicitly who we serve, Asian Pacific Islanders, seniors, veterans, Black Americans, the disabled. It basically lists, I added this up, 76% of the population. And when you say you're actively advocating for 76% 
[P80]  of the population. You're not advocating for 76% of the population. You're discriminating against the 24%. It's gone too far. I would argue in the workplace, having served on seven public company boards, and I'm going to do a lot of boasting here because I'm desperate for all of your affirmation, and 12 private company boards, there's still work to be done in the private sector. There still is a cycle. 40% of all venture capitalists and probably 70% or 80% of all venture capital deployed 
[P81]  are white guys from just two universities, Stanford and Harvard. So I would argue universities, it's gotten out of control. I'd love to see the DEI apparatus disassembled, along with the ethics department, the sustainability department, the leadership department. These are all bullshit where we hire formerly important people with no standards. They never get fired. It just translates to more student debt. In the boardroom, in corporations, in certain sectors, I do think there is a need to be thoughtful about broadening the aperture of the lens 
[P82]  people who are underrepresented. There's still a dearth of women raising venture capital. So I think it's nuanced based on sector. But to just say all DEI is bad, I want to move to where the University of California did in 1997. They don't have race-based affirmative action. They have adversity-based affirmative action. I'm a beneficiary of affirmative action. I had something called Pell Grants. I was raised by a single immigrant mother who lived and died as secretary. So I got grants. I had 
[P83]  unfair advantage because I came from a household that was low income. And I think that there should be affirmative action. And I think it should be based on color, but that color is green. The poor need our help. The moment you start advocating for a special advantage based on any external factors, I think at this point in our society, it probably causes more problems than it solves. That's exactly right. That's exactly right, Stephen. 
[P84]  take a step back and look at why DEI has become such a big part of the conversation, it's precisely because instead of addressing the reality of people's lives, which is some people are disadvantaged and some people are advantaged, actually what we've mainly done, and Scott alluded to at the very beginning of our discussion, is we've given a leg up to very wealthy ethnic minority people from successful families, and they now, their children now get into 
[P85]  prestigious universities, which they probably would have done anyway, some of them, because they come from very advanced backgrounds. And the kids that are growing up in poverty, black and white, have no shot whatsoever. But the reason that it's become such a big issue around the Western world, actually, I don't think it's the nuances that we've delved into here, but actually something else, which is we have created the most ethnically diverse societies in history. And what I mean by that is, 
[P86]  not that we've created societies in which there are large groups of people who are different from each other, but for the first time probably in human history, we've created societies in which there is a lot of ethnic diversity and there is no overt discrimination against some groups of people in the sense of, you know, the imperial societies in the past would have had one dominant ethnic group, which is, you know, the Russians in the Soviet Union or the Turks in the Ottoman Empire 
[P87]  in the British Empire, whatever. That was the ethnic group that was like the dominant one. And everybody else was a kind of second-class citizen and everybody knew it, right? We don't have that anymore. We have highly diverse societies where people of every single background exist in which we have this idea that we're all supposed to be equal. And when we have programs that explicitly discriminate against people, there were times when the discrimination was explicit 
[P88]  black people. Well, we've gone full circle now where the discrimination was going the other way in university admissions, in hiring, in corporate America, in government, in all sorts of things. You know, in this country, the BBC has internships that aren't available to white people, etc. When you get to that point, as Scott said earlier on, everyone just goes, look, I know I'm not supposed to say this, but the reality is this is racism. This is a form of racism. And I thought we were trying to get away from the 
[P89]  So to the extent that the elimination of DEI is about creating a merit-based society in which people are given an opportunity because they're skilled and talented and they have the potential to actually achieve things and create wealth. You know, we all know this. We all employ people, right? How many of us are thinking about the races of the people we hire? I don't think we think about that at all. What we're thinking about is I run a business. I need the very best personable. 
[P90]  very best possible person for this job at the price I'm willing to pay. I don't care if they are purple, green, blue, white, whatever. It doesn't matter. What matters is, are we getting the best person for the job? And my concern about identity politics has always been that if we do not adopt that worldview, then what we will do is create a worldview in which we have different racial groups competing with each other on the basis of race. 
[P91]  very dangerous mix for a multi-ethnic society like ours, which is why I've been begging people to let go of this stupid idea of identity politics and to say, first and foremost, we are all Brits or we are all Americans. We have this umbrella identity under which we all operate and our personal ethnicity or sex or whatever is secondary to that and actually for the purposes of employment, for the purposes of college admission, et cetera, is irrelevant. 
[P92]  Yes, if there is disadvantage, if we grew up in a single-parent home with a low income, we may need some extra support there. If we had terrible schooling or our education was not good, we may need extra support. If there's certain things that make it easier for us because of the disadvantages we've had to fulfill our talent and potential, I am all for that. But what we've created so far, and that's why I'm delighted it's being eliminated, is an anti-meritocratic system which says, 
[P93]  We don't care what you bring to the workplace. We don't care whether you deserve this place or not. We don't care about the potential you have. Actually, we just needed an insert category tick box to fill this slot. And you filled it. It doesn't really matter that you're not doing your job very well because now we can say, you know, we're a diverse company. I don't care about that and we shouldn't care about that as a society. And thank God that's now gone. Yeah, I think the worst part about it too is that it calls into question 
[P94]  and they're from a diverse background, you know, it calls into question why they got that job in the first place, which I think is horrible. You know, I just hired from two candidates, the final two candidates was a guy and a woman. I would hate if the woman felt that she got the job because she's a woman and not because she's best. She turns out she was by far the best in the process. And I would love for her to know that there was absolutely nothing that changed our view. 
[P95]  We weren't trying to fill a position with a woman. We were trying to fill the position with the best, and she should know she was the best. I think the contrast that was really fascinating was between Trump's website and the Democrats' website. So in the Democrats' website, it was who we're for, which was what Scott was saying. But Trump's website was the 20 things we're going to do, and it was just a list of 20. These are the 20 action points. This is what we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this. 
[P96]  as opposed to the identities that we want to advantage list. And I think that was the choice. You know, at the beginning, Constantine, you said, you know, America had a choice. And for me, when I looked at those two websites, I saw this choice between the identities being the main thing or the to-do list being the main thing and very different approaches. Scott, when I was listening to that Zuckerberg interview talking about masculinity and identity issues, one of the lines he said in there, 
[P97]  like something you've said on my show before, where he said, I think having a culture that celebrates that aggression a little bit more, talking about masculinity, has its own merits that are really positive. Now, Mark Zuckerberg isn't necessarily someone that I saw closely aligning to your worldview. Am I right in thinking that that's something you agree with? Because I remember you saying to me, you think people should be able to walk in a room and kick everyone's ass. What I've said on your show is that I think the male form, especially under the age of 30, 
[P98]  with its bone structure, incredible double-twitch muscle, and then this amazing, amazing chemical called testosterone, you're going to look back at your 25-year-old self and think, why wasn't I a fucking monster like Steve Barley? And also, there is some masculinity when Russian soldiers pour over the border in Ukraine. You want some of that big dick energy that Daniel was talking about. In the case of Zuckerberg, 
[P99]  I don't think he really understands an aspirational view of masculinity. I think when he couches immediately kind of trying to kiss Trump's ass because Trump threatened to put him in prison, and what he used to call moderation, he's now calling censorship. And when you have an algorithm that elevates incendiary hateful content, I would not describe that as masculinity. For me, masculinity comes down to protection, providing, and procreation. 
[P100]  Iадib Axel- He's about gendering a workplace in the context of trying to excuse a total elimination of what I would think is probably healthy moderation. I imagine Daniel and Constantine might have a different view. 
[P101]  Right now, when I talk about masculinity, you know, there's if I say at a conference, oh, women are better managers. Everyone goes, yes, that's right. That's right. Right. That's OK. If I say men are more risk aggressive and make better entrepreneurs, you're a misogynist. You're out. And the reality is men and women bring different attributes. But the masculinity and femininity, I think masculinity is a wonderful thing. I think we need a different image of it. I think people born as male have an easier time leaning into those things. 
[P102]  I work out at CrossFit with a bunch of lesbian firefighters. They bring great masculine energy, and they could carry my ass out of a fire. So a lot of men demonstrate wonderful feminine qualities. A lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculine qualities. I don't think these things are sequestered to anyone born as a specific gender. What I think, when I talk about masculinity, I don't talk about it in the role of corporations. I think that's as fraught with risk and not worth talking about. It should be about shareholder value or stakeholder value. 
[P103]  I think young men need a code. We're going to church less. We have fewer relationships. So what's the code you hold on to in terms of creating behaviors that are productive for you, yourself, society? And I think masculinity needs to be redefined as something more aspirational where you're celebrated for being really fucking strong. You're celebrated for not complaining. You're celebrated for creating surplus value. You create more tax revenue than you absorb. You're celebrated for being aggressive. You're celebrated for breaking up fights at bars. 
[P104]  not starting them. You're celebrated for protecting your country, not shitposting it. You're celebrated for approaching strange women and expressing romantic interest. That's not a crime. And if she's not interested and you're rejected, you're both going to be fine. You're celebrated for getting out of the house. You're celebrated for working. You're celebrated for making money and liking money. I think there just needs to be a redefinition of masculinity in the context of helping young men 
[P105]  code that they used to get from the armed services or from dual parent households. And I feel like they're struggling. So I like the idea of something that they feel in their bones and in their body and in their DNA that they can lean into that we celebrate. And the conversation is flipped entirely. Five years ago, I was called a misogynist for talking about masculinity. Now the conversation is being led and advocated by one group, and it's mothers who are like, 
[P106]  My son is not doing well. I got three kids, two daughters, daughters in PR with the other ones at Penn, and my son is in the basement vaping and playing video games. He needs something to latch on to. He needs a code. Anyways, but I apologize. Word salad. Zuckerberg and masculinity, give me a fucking break. He looks like a Chechen Molly dealer. Sorry, back to you, Stephen. Well, it's interesting when you speak, Scott, because your views on masculinity 
[P107]  me to be most better represented by the right side of politics than the left side of politics. They both have their own vision of masculinity. And yours seems to be a Republican view of masculinity. To Trump's credit, he saw the opportunity and he flew right into the manosphere. Rockets, crypto, Joe Rogan, Theo Vaughn. He said, no, I'm not going to run from this. I'm going to fly right into it. Now, I would argue that his vision of masculinity has too much 
[P108]  coarseness, too much cruelty, too much bullying. I don't think that's masculinity. I think when we talk about Elon Musk taking risks, sending rockets that are captured by scissors coming down, inspiring the EV race, taking an enormous risk, making a shit ton of money. Yeah, that's a great form of masculinity. Accusing men trying to save high soccer players, calling them pedophiles, calling your employees a sex criminal such that they have to leave their house, having 13 kids by five women or three women, none of which you live with, 
[P109]  Sleeping next to a loaded gun, losing control of your self-control because of addiction. I don't think that's a great role model. I think it's an amazing role model for boys. I don't think it's a great role model for men. In terms of energy, there are so many reasons why I'm a big matcha fan, if you don't already know by now. And so much so that I actually invested in the UK's leading matcha company called Perfect Ted. And one of my favorite Perfect Ted products is these delicious matcha pouches that come in every flavor from salted caramel, 
[P110]  to peach flavor, to mint flavor, to berry flavor. One of my favorites is this vanilla flavor, which I'm going to make in just two seconds. You just take this mixer here, get a little bit of the powder, pop it on top of the shaker like that. Put the lid on. Shake, shake, shake. Delicious. If you haven't tried this yet, you can find Perfect Ted at Tesco and Holland Barrett stores or online where you can get 40% off with my code, Diary40. 
[P111]  put in code Diary40 to try this delicious multi-flavored matcha now. Highly recommend. And if you do it, please tag me, send me a message online. Do you know that 80% of New Year's resolutions fail by February? It's because we focus too much on the end goal and we forget the small daily actions that actually move us forward. Those actions that are easy to do are also easy not to do in life. It's easy to save a dollar, so it's also easy not to. Making one small improvement each day, one tiny step in the right direction, has a big difference over time. 
[P112]  mindset, which is why we created The 1% Diary, a 90-day journal designed to help you stay consistent and focus on the small wins and make real progress over time. It also gives you access to The 1% Community, a space where you can stay accountable, motivated, inspired, along with many others on the same journey. We launched The 1% Diary in November and it sold out. So now we're doing a second drop. Head to thediary.com to grab yours before it sells out again. I'll put the link below. 
[P113]  Censorship. The word censorship was used there by Scott. We've seen this reversal in Meta's attitude, Facebook's attitude that had been built up over a decade, where it almost felt like if you had sort of right-leaning views or really any unaccepted views and you posted those on Facebook, you would face maybe having the post deleted or your account suspended. This new world of speech, of free speech, and as it pertains to masculinity. 
[P114]  noticed, Scott, you'd left X. You no longer post or tweet on X anymore. Do you think Elon's decision to buy X is a net positive for society? Net, yes. But I think what people hear when you say that is there's no problems with this system than, you know, compared to the ones we had before. There are definitely disadvantages to a free platform like X now. And one of them is 
[P115]  inevitably when you remove censorship, one of the things the censorship was doing was keeping all the deeply unpleasant people away from being able to shove things in your face. And that happens quite a lot on it. So I don't enjoy that aspect of it. But I've always said that would be the price that we would pay for freedom. Freedom always has a price, and that's what we're seeing. As for Zuckerberg, his miraculous transformation into a free speech warrior 
[P116]  And I'm delighted to welcome him. I'm sure it's entirely genuine and not anything to do with the election results we've just seen in any way whatsoever. And the fact that the culture shifted and those of us who were being censored by people like him for years actually winning the argument. Well, what it shows you is we've won the argument on free speech when it comes to the big tech platforms. And it's going to be messy. 
[P117]  that are algorithmically driven, where the truth and the moderate reasonable take is not what usually gets attention, you're going to see a lot of unpleasantness. I value the ability to hear and communicate truthful ideas and facts over my own subjective feelings. Oh, someone said a thing I don't like or someone was racist or someone was misogynistic. I don't enjoy the fact that that happens. 
[P118]  but I would rather that happened and also we were not being censored from saying, you know, COVID probably came from a lab in China, which we were. You know, the Hunter Biden laptop story isn't Russian disinformation. Actually, it's an important piece of information that American voters need to hear when they're making their decision about the election. And all of these other things that were being suppressed and censored across social media for years, they're not anymore. 
[P119]  that's a good thing. And I think that's helpful. And if you look at, you know, to bring it back to the UK for a moment, Stephen, as you know, on Trigonometry, we've tried to cover the grooming gangs scandal and is an outrage what happened in this country over decades. We've been covering that for years, since about 2019, 2020, to very little purchase. And one of the reasons is it was just something that the media sort of covered and then moved on, when it actually should have been something we talked about on 
[P120]  daily basis until serious action was taken. And we saw real, real change, real change in policing, real change in social work, real change in government, real change in the way that these racially aggravated hate crimes were treated. Well, none of that was really being talked about seriously until Elon kicked up a fuss, amplified the voices of survivors, amplified the voices of campaigners on X, which he bought. And now the British government is forced 
[P121]  to do whatever it can to actually address those issues to the extent that it will. A lot of people will say it still doesn't go far enough. Well, if it doesn't go far enough, we now have a platform from which we can continue to have that conversation until there is the sort of inquiry and the sort of outcomes that people want to actually deliver real change. So is that a positive? God, yes. God, yes. We needed that. 
[P122]  by someone like Elon Musk on a platform like X, which is now free, to the point where Keir Starmer is forced into defensive action. I wish that was around 30 years ago because a hell of a lot of young girls and women wouldn't have suffered the way they did if we had the opportunity to get that message out. So, God, yes, it's a net positive. Just to pick up on that, Constantine, I've had a question in my mind for a while regarding the scandal, which is horrific, I think it's something we all definitely agree on, is why has Elon chosen 
[P123]  now? And why has he chosen Keir Starmer as the sort of central target of this flurry of tweets around the grooming scandals? Because there's clearly, Elon's, I think, an individual which you can kind of see thinking in real time. Like if you go back through his tweets, because there's so many of them, and they kind of come in these spurts, you can almost see what he's getting at. Is there an underlying reason why he's made this a central issue over the last couple of weeks? 
[P124]  is actually most Americans were completely unaware of this issue until recently. I remember a year ago speaking at a private event in New York and somebody said to me, well, you know, what is the consequence of political correctness? Why are you so against it? Why are you so against censorship? And I talked about the grooming gangs and people were horrified. They hadn't even, and these are well-informed, educated people who are media savvy and whatever. So one of the reasons is I think to a lot of Americans, this issue is only coming to the fore. 
[P125]  now in front of their mind. The second issue, I think, is that Elon Musk understands what I said earlier, which is we have a global Western culture now. And so what happens in Britain matters just as much as what happens in America, because we are symbiotic with each other now. When there's a restriction of speech in the UK, when we have laws about what people are not allowed to say, that has an impact across the world. When you see the European Union trying to pass legislation, 
[P126]  about online censorship. That has an impact because if something exists in the UK and in many European countries, it's only a matter of time before people in America are going to say, well, look, they've got this in Europe. Why don't we bring it over here? And vice versa. So what happens in America affects us in Europe and in the UK. And what happens in Europe and the UK affects America. So what Elon, I think, is trying to do is to say, we care about our civilization. Elon doesn't really talk that much about the United States. 
[P127]  about our civilization as I do, because I believe that we are now one thing to a very significant extent. Now, from our civilizational point of view, is it a good thing that mass rape gangs in the UK are being insufficiently investigated and treated improperly by the police and the government? No, it's not. It's a very bad thing. So how do we address that? Well, we address that by putting pressure on the government of the day. Now, I don't see the grooming gangs as a party political issue. 
[P128]  it properly, although there were individual members of the cabinet that tried to do something like Sir Le Braverman. But he's putting pressure on the government of the day. You can see him going after Nigel Farage, of all people, and saying Nigel Farage is not the right leader for reform. So he's attempting to shape British politics in the direction that he feels is the right way. What does he want? What outcome does he want? Look, I don't know what Elon Musk wants. I don't know him personally. I haven't even yet had a chance 
[P129]  to interview him, which I really look forward to doing, because I think he's one of the great visionaries of our time. Whether you like him or not, I think that's undeniably true. But my sense is he's trying to talk about all the things that we've been discussing, freedom of expression, the end of identity politics and the pursuit of meritocracy, a pioneering, inspiring vision of the future, which is why he's talking about Mars and a vision for our civilization that goes beyond the narrow squabbling 
[P130]  here on Earth. And the understanding that human beings are meant, we left the cave. We're not supposed to stay in a place with the walls closing in on us and feel like we're in decline. We're not supposed to be a civilization that has 1.5 children per woman and that is simply just leaving the planet Earth because we can't reproduce. We're supposed to look at the future with hope and optimism. We're supposed to say, 
[P131]  I want things to be better for my children. I want to have children. I want the vision of our society being one of positivity and optimism and a sense of a pioneering vision and inspiration. That's what I think he wants. And I don't really see any of that in the current government in the UK. And I think he's right to go after them and say, you are destroying your country's economy. You're destroying its culture. You're destroying its sense of cohesiveness by allowing illegal immigration. 
[P132]  You are destroying that sense of optimism and vision. And you're not saying to people, let's build something better. You're saying, let's stay small. Let's play small. Let's not rise above our station. And I think we need people like that, imperfect as they may be in all sorts of different ways, to drive our civilization forward, to say to us, there is an inspiring vision to which we're all moving, as opposed to just sitting there and waiting to die, which is what we've been doing for far too long. 
[P133]  I think Elon is taking him at his word. You know, he said a year ago that he was going to absolutely dismantle the woke mind virus globally and he was going to ensure meritocracy and free speech. And when he sets his mind on something, he has the ability to stay focused on it for a very long time to a degree most people can't fathom. You know, and he's absolutely willing to endure pain. He loves a fight. He obviously has the kind of mind that can't relax unless he's kind of grinding up against some gear. 
[P134]  as well. Like the way he works needs stress in his life. He needs a big enemy. He needs a big fight to engage with. And I think Keir Starmer just ticked all of his boxes as someone to go up against. I think what's interesting is we talk about these big tech. I love that Scott has previously talked about breaking up big tech. And I think there's potential for that in the next four years. All of these guys like Trump and JD Vance and all of them have locked horns with big tech. 
[P135]  and they've come, you know, this is their chance to get revenge on big tech in the next four years. They could do a little, you know, you might see Google have to, you know, spin off YouTube or you might see AWS have to come away from Amazon or something like that. Who knows? But it's interesting that a lot of these big tech guys, they're probably cozying up to Trump because, you know, that could be on the cards as well. There's been a lot of Trump butt kissing over the last couple of weeks. 
[P136]  bragged about the fact that everybody's flown down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss his butt and to cozy up with him. And there's now headlines saying that there's this tech oligarchy forming in the United States where Bezos and Elon and Zuck are all now friends and they're stood behind Trump as this unifying force. Just to touch on a few points of that, but also on Constantine's message that Elon is doing this for the betterment of humanity, to further humanity, his involvement with the UK, but his broader involvement in politics now. Scott, does that square with how you think about Elon? 
[P137]  And I am quite curious to ask you why you made the decision to leave X and to go to Blue Sky and Threads and things like that. Yeah, I can't speculate on what motivates Elon Musk. I quite frankly just don't get the guy. And I don't have the domain expertise to comment on the rape gangs. It's such a serious, upsetting issue. I don't know it well enough to speak intelligently to it. Just the topic of censorship, though, as it relates to meta, 
[P138]  A hallmark of a free society and a democracy is that pretty much anyone can say pretty much anything about pretty much anybody. I believe that. The question is, do machines and bots have free speech rights? Because if I say something, I believe, and I may be paranoid, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong. I believe VCs whose portfolio companies I've said have overvalued have enlisted thousands of bots to basically just shitpost me over and over on X to diminish my credibility. 
[P139]  critical of Putin that the GRU has hired troll farms to create lists of thousands of people to weaponize bots to say disparaging things about them. Do those bots have free speech rights? In addition, when Fox News distributes information to its anchors saying Dominion voting machines were weaponized by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, despite the fact they knew that was not true, but they tell their broadcasters to do it anyways. And then Dominion says, this hurt our business. 
[P140]  and you knew it was false, and you decided to communicate it anyways, courts find them liable. They have to pay three quarters of a billion dollars. What happened at Fox News was a dumpster fire compared to the nuclear mushroom cloud on Meta. So a lot of what we're talking about here, if you want to say that mRNA vaccines alter your DNA, I think you should have the right to say that. The dissenter's voice is important because occasionally the conspiracy theorist ends up being correct. 
[P141]  is, when you have a business model that elevates the most incendiary, ugly content beyond its organic reach, should you then be exonerated from all liability and slander that traditional media companies are liable to? If we were to say that Elon Musk is a pedophile and start stating facts and evidence of it, and he could show that it's hurt his ability to raise money for Tesla, and he filed legal action against this podcast, 
[P142]  I think we would be in a world of hurt, and that legal liability is warranted. But the most powerful media companies in the world have Section 230 protection, so they have a business model where conspiracy theory or novel content, which is Latin for bullshit and lies, and the more angry it is, it gets elevated beyond its organic reach. So while I'm kind of down with the notion that we should have free speech and anybody should be able to say pretty much whatever they want, 
[P143]  There's something wrong when we have algorithms that have a profit incentive around rage, conspiracy theory, and lies, and two-thirds of Republicans believe that the election was stolen, when one in five Americans think that 9-11 was an inside job. Let's be honest. They thought that before the internet. I remember watching all the 9-11 truth of movies and all of that. But your point overall is right. I totally agree. 
[P144]  Wait, Elon agrees with you. When he bought X, he talked about the bot problem. He talked about the amplification of outrage. He hasn't done as much as I hoped he would have done so far, but I hope that they do address that because that isn't an Elon or an X problem. It's a technology problem of the modern world. The reality is that the more we live our lives online, the more you're going to have the problem of the ability of foreign governments, of individual people to create fake accounts, 
[P145]  bot farms, et cetera, to influence the way we look at all of these things. And we are going to have to come to terms with that reality because it's a technological issue that we're going to have to solve for and we haven't yet. It's also very easy for people to get caught in their own bubbles as well, which is a new phenomenon. There was a time where if you believed crazy things, you still had to sit next to someone else in church and talk to them about their life and what they believe. And you encountered dissenting voices. 
[P146]  encountered sane, rational people who had very different views to you that you had to be friends with long term. Whereas where we are right now is if you've got some sort of crazy view, you can find yourself only talking to people who share those views and only sharing content that reinforces those views until such time that you become extremely radicalized. I think that's such an important point because I think it's a real shame that AI LLMs aren't crawling the real world. I was at Granger's yesterday. Someone comes up to me. 
[P147]  Love your content. Let's take a picture. They're so nice. Another person comes up to me and says, I disagree with your view on this, but we have a civil conversation. And then I come home to 40 bots telling me I'm Professor Genocide. I mean, people in the real world, generally speaking, I don't know if it's because of the threat of physical violence, or they want to have sex with you, or maybe they think at some point you'll hire their kid, or generally just a comity of man. But people in real life, I find, are just lovely and wonderful. And it's a shame that these LLMs aren't calling this. 
[P148]  because the treif and some of the vile shit they're crawling online, which I don't even think reflects our species. I think it reflects technology that has a profit motive around promoting the most incendiary, hateful content. So there's got to be some sort of medium speed here. And also, I got off X, Steve, because you don't like Chick-fil-A, don't eat a Chick-fil-A. If Musk wants to pay $44 billion and turn it into a Nazi porn bar, that's his right. 
[P149]  illegal. I don't think the government should step in. But I don't have to paint his fence. And I can go to another platform. That's my right, too. And everyone says, oh, you're against free speech. I'm like, no, I'm not. I'm against being on a platform that makes me feel bad. So he has the right. And all this notion around meta, free speech, it's a little different because they control so much of the media. But these are media companies, and they should be liable for slander or defamation, the same way traditional media companies are in 
[P150]  I think we could solve a lot of this problem by just removing 230 protections for algorithmically elevated content. If you decide to elevate content beyond its organic reach, then you are making an editorial decision and you should be liable if that, in fact, is slanderous or defamatory. I think that's really fascinating as a way of handling it. And also, we're living in a world where, as of this year, some of the most phenomenal content you will read will be algorithmic. 
[P151]  generated and some of the most compelling content. So this idea that Scott's talking about, should bots have free speech? It sounds like a kind of, you know, intellectual kind of pseudo intellectual topic, but it's absolutely a very practical topic in the sense that bots now can generate conversations very easily. And some of the, you know, you could spend all day talking to a bot and not know. It's funny, this is this subject has come up because in the last week, I've had a flurry of messages on 
[P152]  WhatsApp from friends. I actually had two tweets yesterday, which you could probably see if you just search my name. Because on X at the moment, there's multiple ads running that are fake articles with fake BBC headlines with my face in. So it says things like, the Bank of England is suing Steve Bartlett. And this is running as a sponsored ad on X. And people are tweeting me these things. My friend says every time he refreshes the feed, he sees a new sponsored ad of a fake article of me. And sometimes it's like, can't believe this happened to Steve. And it's a BBC article. 
[P153]  you click on it, you get scammed. I think it's a crypto scam. I don't want to click. I'll send the link to you guys so you can click on it for me. But I just, it really has, because that is a bot. There's multiple of them, multiple accounts that have been spun up. They're all verified accounts. And it's AI generated imagery with a paid ad behind it. That's the bit that really gets me. I get people can post shit, but sponsoring it is a new level of defamation. One of the big macro things I've been thinking a lot about 
[P154]  haven't shared yet, is just the amount of social networks that have emerged. In the last 10 years, there's been a 50% increase so far in new social networks that have emerged. And we're seeing this splintering now of the rumbles, the blue skies, the threads. And it almost seems, talking about echo chambers, that social networks are becoming sort of political environments. And you're choosing your social network now based on your politics. This doesn't seem like a net positive thing for society. 
[P155]  argumentation of our reality. And it comes, you know, Scott's point about people behaving better in person is true. Although I would say there is the windscreen effect or the windshield effect, which is if someone cuts you up in traffic and you feel that there's some kind of physical separation between the two of you, most people behave slightly differently in that context than they would if they were sitting next to somebody face to face in a bar. So there's something about being physically present with other people that changes it, 
[P156]  one of the reasons, you know, I know you have pretty much all your interviews face to face and we do as well, because I generally speaking, it's very difficult to connect authentically with people. Obviously, we've managed to do it in the course of this conversation, but beyond that, it's difficult. And so we're going to have to work on that. But I just what the point I'm trying to make is this isn't a political issue. It's not an X issue. It's not an Elon Musk issue. It's a technological issue. We're living through 
[P157]  probably already have lived through most of the digital revolution. And I used to, as a kid, love Isaac Asimov science fiction books. And one of the reasons I did enjoy reading them so much is it was a world in which there was an exploration of what does the creation of robots, which is what we're living through, mean for morality? What does it mean for philosophy? What does it mean for humanity? What does it mean for, how do we build rules in a world 
[P158]  in which you have these machines that take every rule literally and suddenly you find that, you know, the desire to protect humanity results in the end of humanity. How do you navigate all of this? And that is what we're living through. We are also living through a period when our realities are being fragmented. And so we believe a very small set of things that other people like us somewhere in a very different part of the world, as Daniel was saying earlier, 
[P159]  believe, and we now live in this, we don't live in England or in Scotland or in America. We live almost like in a world of people who think like us in the West. And then other people live right next door to us who live in a whole different world because they consume a whole different set of information. That is the reality. We can complain about it. That is not going to change. And the only thing I really want to, 
[P160]  raise where I disagree with Scott about this idea that Facebook and X, et cetera, they are publishers and not platforms. I don't think you can apply the same media organization section to them. I don't think it's appropriate. They are platforms in which people publish information. The artificial amplification is a fair point. We need to deal with that. We need to deal with the bot problem. 
[P161]  That's a very difficult one because one of the challenges is the only way to really deal that I can see with the bot problem is to get people to verify their identity online. That obviously has a lot of questions around that because once you start forcing people to give their identity over to some anonymous blob online, who's collecting that data? What are they doing with it? 
[P162]  then the question for you is, well, you know, let's say right now I look at Twitter and I'm like, yeah, I'm happy to verify my identity. I'm happy to confirm who I am. Well, what if, you know, George Soros buys X off Elon at some point? Are you still happy that that information is being held? Are you still happy that the anonymous account you've now made confirmed? You know, what happens to the anonymous activists speaking about the Ayatollah's regime in Iran? 
[P163]  identity and the wrong person buys that platform or someone hacks it, et cetera. So it's a conversation that's not, if there were easier solutions on these issues, they would have been solved by now. This is a very difficult thing for humanity to navigate, and we're going to have to find a way to do it, and incrementally so. I just want to respond to that. I think you're guilty of the same illusion of complexity that protects these companies from acting like actors such that they can do anything regardless of the damage to the commonwealth to add shareholder value. 
[P164]  If you implemented, we have, first off, this notion that you don't want to give up your identity. Trust me, they know everything about you, Constantine, already. And I could go get a ton of information on you from the dark web fairly easily with a credit card. So the notion that somehow we shouldn't have some sort of, you could have, we need age verification for social media. There's no reason anyone in the age of 16 should be on a social media platform. And regarding the, 
[P165]  the civil rights activist or the women's rights activist that needs an anonymity, you could create a number of accounts and use blockchain or some sort of third-party anonymous to have a certain number of accounts that says, look, if you want an anonymous parody account, you want to make fun of people, fine. If you want an account talking about issues that you feel are sensitive from other markets, fine. We could absolutely figure that out and then figure out, okay, this account is doing nothing. It has no base. It has no soul. 
[P166]  values. It has 72 followers. All it's doing is trying to start fights online. All it's doing is trying to make people feel shitty about Britain or shitty about America. And the reality is these companies use that illusion of complexity such that they can have more bots creating more fake clicks, more Nissan ads, and more shareholder value. I think there's a middle ground here. I think we could figure this out. I agree. Well, that's what I'm saying. I think some of the ideas that you're putting forward, right or wrong, I don't know. 
[P167]  conversations we should be having. How do we make sure? I mean, my son is two and a half years old. And if my wife has become a complete screen Nazi, so he's probably not going to get a phone until he's about 40. But I think your point about people shouldn't be on social media. People shouldn't be on social media until they're 16. Absolutely correct. What that's doing to the minds of, well, or everybody, but particularly young people who are really susceptible to it. 
[P168]  The verification dimension is difficult, as I say. We're going to have to hash this all out as humanity. We're just going to have to work this all out. How do we live in this new world that we now live in? It's going to take some time. And I hope it's not as bad as the last time the information space was revolutionized, which was the printing press. That caused about two centuries of religious war. Hopefully we can avoid that. And part of the way to do that is to create environments which are uncensored, 
[P169]  People can express different ideas. We can have these battles and eventually come to some sort of mutual understanding. I hope that happens. What I wanted to ask you all to really close out this conversation was these conversations tend to be a bit of a reflection of what's in the news cycle and what's in the news cycle tends to be a reflection of what people are clicking. And a lot of that's driven by fear and the sort of narrative of the time, whether it's immigration or the Trump inauguration. But what is the big important idea that we're not talking about? 
[P170]  what's the most important thing that we should be talking about that isn't getting enough attention right now as it relates to the future of the West? And that's a big, broad question. I'll start with you, Daniel. For me, it's the schooling system. I think the schooling system is not preparing people for a world that exists and that we're teaching. You know, we haven't grasped the fact that AI is going to be the biggest, most disruptive technology in the lives of our children 
[P171]  into probably won't exist. We need to have a radical look at this idea that children should go to school with the same age groups or study a certain set of topics or that it should be topic-based at all. We need to explore, you know, are there better models for the schooling system that prepare people for the world that we're going to be in? Our current schooling system goes back to the early 1800s. 
[P172]  military schooling system in Prussia. And that's kind of where it evolved from. I think what we need to do is think about what are the, you know, what are the skills that our kids are going to need? I see too. And I can only, I don't feel like I can wrap my arms around UK's issues, but in terms of the US political extremism, I would put it number two, you know, at negative 40 Celsius and Fahrenheit meet. And because of our electoral system and Citizens United, people from the far left who are crazy and people from the 
[P173]  right who are crazy are just overrepresented. And they come together to meet on reckless spending, deficit spending. They come together to agree on anti-Semitism. And there's just too many people on the far left and the far right. And the people in the middle, it's minority rule. They're just not represented. However, I think the biggest threat that people aren't talking about, and I've actually spent some time talking with the administration around this, or the former administration, I should say, is loneliness. And that is, you have the deepest pocketed, most well-resourced 
[P174]  companies and people in the world trying to convince people, especially young men, that they can have a reasonable facsimile of life on a screen with an algorithm. And I think they literally go crazy. I think they wake up and they're obese and lonely and have no skills. We talked about this. I think young people, I say this jokingly, but seriously, I think young people need to get out of the house more, drink more, make a series of bad decisions that might pay off. I think we need more sex. I think we need more people in third spaces. 
[P175]  more church, more religious, more institutions, national service. We're mammals. And I worry that we're, one in seven men doesn't have a single friend. One in four men can't name a best friend. So this loneliness epidemic where people get into a bubble and start engaging in conspiracy theory, not trusting each other, blaming women, blaming the nation, self-harm. I just, I worry about, you know, when I say to young men, I coach a lot of young men, 
[P176]  15 minutes for a reason. This shit is hard and it's worth it. But I worry that we're raising, like I said, this new species of asocial, asexual being called the young American male that is obese, anxious, and just a shitty citizen. Constantine, the most important thing in 2025 that's not getting enough attention? In the UK and in most of Europe, it's an issue that Daniel raised earlier, which is in the UK, our energy prices are four times what they are in the United States. 
[P177]  That is an ideological decision. It's done because we're saving the planet. That's what we're being told. The reality is our contribution to global carbon emissions is we're responsible for 2% of global carbon emissions in the world. Making British pensioners freeze to death every winter because they can't afford fuel bills is not the solution to climate change. And if you amplify that further, 
[P178]  making our economy uncompetitive, making Britain unable to generate wealth for itself and for its future is not the moral position. Net zero, which is the impoverishment of our society for ideological reasons, has been positioned as the moral cause where we're saving the planet, we're ending climate change. We're not doing any of that. All we're doing is virtue signaling and making our fellow citizens suffer. So what we should be talking about is how do we make energy cheap, again, 
[P179]  so that we can have a prosperous economy. And guess what? When people are prosperous, that's when they actually start being responsible about pollution, about throwing away things they don't need. And also, when you have money, that's when you can invest money in scientific research, which allows you to find cleaner, better forms of energy. That's what we should be doing. We should be making sure that we generate as much wealth for our fellow citizens as possible, because a lot of people are struggling. 
[P180]  deeply, deeply immoral to impoverish already poor pensioners in this country and to prevent businesses from hiring people and giving them jobs and opportunities, including the young men that Scott is talking about, because we are saving the planet and we're trying to keep little Greta happy. We're not doing any of that. We're not successful in that. We should stop pretending and we should do what Donald Trump said he plans to do, which is drill baby drill. We should be exploring and exploiting all the energy reserves 
[P181]  this country in order to create clean energy and better forms of energy for the future, as well as to improve the well-being of our fellow citizens. That's what we should be talking about a hell of a lot more than we are. You need cheap energy. You're right. It's what I would argue. I think it's going to be liquid, natural gas and nuclear. We haven't talked about AI. AI requires 10 times the energy. The AI query is a Google query. The choke point is energy. I would argue in the US, I think we'd benefit more from as opposed 
[P182]  The drill, baby, drill, build, baby, build. I think young people have seen housing prices just go crazy. There's a psychological benefit to household formation, forced savings. So I'm going to take your word because you're a very smart guy that Britain has implemented a series of policies. That energy stat you rolled out was incredible. But in the U.S., like I said, I don't want to say we're drowning in oil. There were more drilling permits issued under Biden. 
[P183]  than the previous Trump admitted. I mean, just to call Biden anti-energy or that somehow we have this massively overinflated energy prices, it's just not, that hasn't happened in the US. I would like, we need more homes in the US. And in the UK too. And Stephen, let me just, before you wrap up, fill the stats out a little bit more. Obviously, everyone understands that geopolitically we're in a pretty tense time and there's conflicts happening. 
[P184]  Britain is in a position now where we would struggle. You've got to remember British history. Britain is, Britannia rules the waves, right? The way that Britain has become a great nation throughout history is by having a powerful fleet. We would struggle to build warships now because we've closed down all our steelworks because we're green, right? It's insanity. And on every other issue to do with energy and industry, we have basically deliberately moved our production 
[P185]  facilities to other countries. Okay, great idea. Globalization, make things cheaper, ship things, but wonderful. Okay, what happened during COVID? What happened when suddenly the entire chains of production weren't quite operating the way that they normally do? Oh, China's suddenly hoarding all the masks. Interesting. So what do you think is going to happen when there's a war? Or they're just going to keep shipping the steel to us to make the battleships and the warplanes that we need to fight them? That's what you think is going to happen? This whole thing, this whole agenda is ideological, 
[P186]  And what Ed Miliband is about to do to this country when it comes to this issue needs to talk about way more. And it is about economic prosperity. It is about housing, because one of the reasons we don't build as much housing as we need to is, again, building housing produces emissions. And we don't want to be not green. So that's why people in their 30s and 40s are now living in flat shares for four people. We have got to let go of this obsession with net zero. We have got to build. We have got to drill. 
[P187]  We have got to produce energy and we have got to stop thinking that the moral thing to do is to make our poor citizens suffer in order that we feel good about saving the planet, which we're not even remotely saving by doing this. Guys, thank you so much for all of your perspective. One of the things I realised as you guys were talking is that you're all fathers and you're all fathers of boys, although you're fathers of boys at different ages. So I wanted to just give you all 30 seconds if you could. 
[P188]  self for this advice but based on everything that's happening in the world which can feel incredibly confusing especially to young people where we're getting a lot of our information from different echo chambers what is the advice that you would all give to your young boys that would best prepare them for the future in the next couple of years starting with you Dan yeah so I've got a six-year-old daughter a seven-year-old son and a 
[P189]  them for a world that's fast changing is difficult. We're taking the approach of a lot of general knowledge across a lot of things so that you can use AI to run deep in different topics. We're encouraging the kids to interact with supervised AI conversations and letting them know that that technology is available. We're also just focusing on some manual skills, like how to fix a boiler and how to saw through some wood. 
[P190]  you know, those kind of things. And also we're doing things like acting classes, being up on a stage and performing. So all of those kind of typical things. But to be honest, it is a point of anxiety in my life just thinking about what, you know, what the world looks like for, you know, 10 or 15 years from now that they're going to be going into. So if you get clear answers on this, I'm really open to learning. 
[P191]  For me, my son is two and a half, so it's a little bit early for this pep talk. But my message to him when he's old enough to hear it is going to be this. Your grandfather, your great-grandfather, my grandfather, was taken as a slave laborer from Soviet Ukraine to Nazi Germany. Your great-grandfather was born, your great-grandmother, rather, was born in the Soviet Gulag. Your great-grandmother lived through the German occupation 
[P192]  Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. You are not living in the worst time ever. You're surrounded by pussies. If you are a man and if you do your job and if you learn the skills that you need to do and if you pursue the things that you want to do with your life to the best of your ability, if you believe in yourself, if you believe that you're talented, if you actually achieve the things that you set your mind to, there's never been a better time in the history of humanity than now. You're surrounded mostly by people who feel sorry for themselves, 
[P193]  If you're not one of them, you're going to clean up. Young women are looking for a young man like you who's actually going to stand up for himself, who's actually going to go out there and achieve and be confident. Be that and you're going to clean up when it comes to finding the right partner for yourself. You're going to clean up when it comes to making money. You're going to clean up when it comes to your career. You're going to clean up on every front because the bar has never been lower. The bar has never been lower. So just go out and be a man and life is going to be great. 
[P194]  I'm older. I have 14 and 17 year old boys. And my observation is you can't tell them anything. The best you can do is you can try and model behavior for them. So I'm trying to be really kind to their mother. I'm trying to show them that, you know, if you're serious about having a good family, you got to be a generous, loving partner. I'm trying to be in great physical shape, which is getting harder and harder. I'm trying to be aggressive around them in terms of business. 
[P195]  business and trying to be kind. And what I do, I do talk to them about the concept of surplus value. I'm like, you're takers right now. You know, the UK school system, which is amazing, is investing a lot in you and you're giving almost nothing back. Me and your mother are loving you a lot more than you're loving us. You're just taking resources everywhere. You're a net negative. And you're crossing the manhood isn't sex or some religious ceremony. You're crossing the manhood is when 
[P196]  you are start creating surplus value. You're loving more people than you're absorbing. You're listening to more complaints than you are complaining. You're creating more revenue than you're absorbing. That's the notion. It's surplus value. And I have this trick called what a man does. And I've been doing this when they're kids. I'm like, guests show up. A man goes and gets their luggage and puts it in their room. A man is constantly scanning the table for empty water glasses. And I mean, one of the proudest moments I ever had was when I'm like, 
[P197]  my six-year-old boy who was all like 30 pounds got up and went over this gigantic pitcher of water at this table and like started like trying to pour other people's water and everyone had no idea what was going on here. You know, I do these things called what a man does. A man goes up to, a man asks a woman out for coffee. A man pays for women. I'm a sexist that way. I still have told my men, my son gave me this rap on, oh dad, you're so establishment. I'm like, do you ever want to have sex? 
[P198]  I'm like, then you need to pay. I mean, that's the bottom line. Anyways, but what I would say is I'm trying to model. I'm trying to model good behavior or be a good role model. But I agree with Constantine and Daniel. I think every day they have more potential to lead the most amazing life in history. I'm not a nihilist. I'm not a catastrophist. I think I have big problems. But given the blessings of the sons born to these, 
[P199]  men and future you know future sons that you'll have steven jesus it's good to be them there's just they have no excuse they should they should they should rock on they should have a wonderful life constantine scott daniel thank you so much for taking the time um at sort of short notice to talk about all these subjects it's incredibly wide-ranging conversation and you'll bring such an interesting hilarious nuanced perspective to these issues i'm glad that we can have these conversations and disagree in a respectful way that hopefully clarifies a lot of the confusion that i 
[P200]  experience and a lot of people are experiencing at the moment so thank you to all of you i'm going to link to all of your work on the screen i know scott you've got a book coming on masculinity which we're all very very excited about we've been waiting it's long overdue please hurry up um constantine you've got an incredible podcast with trigonometry which i'm going to link on the screen and i suggest everybody goes and listens to and subscribes to if they're looking for more of this stuff and daniel you've just been on my show already but your endless amount of books and i think the best place to get more from you is your website of course uh your the daniel priestly website where you can find all of your books and all of your work and everything you're doing there 
[P201]  Thank you, everybody. Really, really appreciative and incredibly grateful for taking part in our first little experiment of this kind. So, yeah, thank you.

[P1] ﻿ The world is absolutely crazy right now. This is one of the most interesting moments of social, cultural and economic transition that I have ever seen. So I wanted to do something that I've never done before. I called upon three of the leading voices on social, cultural, business and economic issues to give their unfiltered, uncensored points of view so that we can all make sense of all of this craziness happening before our eyes. They don't always agree on much, but today they thrash it out to see if they can agree on something. 
[P2]  Go through the economy, Trump, Elon Musk, EEI, censorship, wokeism, and why so many men are struggling. Why are tens of thousands of millionaires running away from the UK? The terrifying truth and opportunity in AI. And I ask all of them, what is the most important thing in 2025 that nobody is talking about? With the aim of reaching clarity, agreement, and having a laugh in the process. This is the episode you probably didn't know you needed. 
[P3]  When we look at the back end of Spotify and Apple and our audio channels, the majority of people that watch this podcast haven't yet hit the follow button or the subscribe button, wherever you're listening to this. I would like to make a deal with you. If you could do me a huge favour and hit that subscribe button, I will work tirelessly from now until forever to make the show better and better and better and better. I can't tell you how much it helps when you hit that subscribe button. The show gets bigger, which means we can expand the production, bring in all the guests you want to see and continue to doing this thing we love. If you could do me that small favour and hit the follow button, 
[P4]  wherever you're listening to this, that would mean the world to me. That is the only favour I will ever ask you. Thank you so much for your time. Back to this episode. You guys are three of the best commentators, the most articulate people I know that also have the most interesting, broad experience and also I think political background. So I wanted to talk to you about everything that's going on in the world. And I wanted to ask you guys some of the dumb questions that I ponder alone with myself and with my dumb friends in my WhatsApp group. 
[P5]  It feels to me that the world is at a real moment of transition in many regards. So like social transition, cultural transition, economic transition. And I think the US has been a catalyst for all of that. So that's why I wanted to have this conversation today. We've got an American here, Scott. I think Scott's the only American here. We've got Constantine. We've got Daniel, who are two Brits, but spend a lot of time between America as well. And so I want to come to Scott first and ask Scott a question, which is a very big, broad question, 
[P6]  your perspective, Scott, you know, when I talk about this feeling of transition, that seems to be like almost inside my chest, that we're at a really historic moment. What is your analysis on this? What is the big picture here? What's happened over the last three, four, five, six, seven months? And how is that going to impact all of us around the world? Well, if you think of the US as setting the tone economically, and maybe even culturally for the West, there's definitely a reversion away from 
[P7]  people feel that quote-unquote wokeism, and I don't like to use that word, but I'll use it here, was this sort of overcorrection to systemic racism and that it began to cause more damage than it was or cause more problems than it was solving. And I think there's been a serious kind of lurch back, if you will, whether it's executive actions declaring the border, a state of emergency, stuff around saying that gender is a thing, 
[P8]  and female. And most of these issues, the actually American public supports, I would say on a more cynical level, America used to be a platform for prosperity, the protection of civil rights, the projection of women's rights and power and democracy abroad. And I would argue that it feels like a pretty quick transition to almost like a, you know, I call it a kleptocracy, but America has become a platform for 
[P9]  acquiring wealth and then leveraging that wealth as a means or a proxy of power. And the ultimate example of that was the launch of two meme coins, the Trump coin and the Melania coin, the day before the presidency, such that this conversation could have already or might happen this week. And I'll finish here. President Trump, it's Vlad. We're thinking about stabilizing our currency or trying to send the outflows of our reserves. 
[P10]  into the Trump coin, which, based on my economist estimation, would take the value of it to a $20 or $30 billion market cap, making you one of the wealthiest men in the world, Mr. Trump. And none of this would be disclosable or transparent. Also, in unrelated news, we'd really appreciate you seizing arms shipments to Ukraine. So I think we've gone kind of full kleptocracy is the way I would describe it. Are you optimistic, Scott? Well, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. 
[P11]  I don't know if I'm just getting older, but no, I don't see a man convicted of sexual abuse or found liable who inspired an insurrection retaking the White House as a point of light for the American experience. Constantine, I suspect you'd have a slightly different view on all of the above. How are you feeling about everything that happened yesterday? Did you watch the inauguration? What is your big picture, 30,000 feet view? 
[P12]  make bold predictions about what's going to happen over the next six to seven months. I do think what America had at the election and what the election of Donald Trump represents is something that we in the UK don't have, which is choice. They had a very clear choice between two very different perspectives on the world, between two very different approaches, between two very different candidates. And ultimately, criticisms of President Trump are necessary and legitimate. Of course they are. 
[P13]  But at the end of the day, I believe having spent quite a lot of time in America around election time and also just generally and traveling around real America, not just in D.C. and L.A. and New York. The reason that he was elected was that the American people are not prepared to accept what Europeans have decided they're prepared to accept, which is managed decline. The American people do not want their country to become weaker. They do not want it to become poorer. 
[P14]  impoverish their fellow citizens through net zero. What they want is their country to be great, their country to be powerful, their country to be influential. The economic realities for most Americans are not really reflected in the figures that we are told. So when people talk about inflation, the reality of people's lives on the ground is that their cost of living has gone up very, very significantly over the last few years. 
[P15]  overall inflation figure that we're shown because certain things are much more influential in people's lives than others. And so whether the decision to elect President Trump ends up being this positive thing for which there should be lots of optimism is a matter of the next four years. Are we going to see a presidency that really does everything it promises? And by the way, you know, if you look at the things that Donald Trump is promising, 
[P16]  Whether you're left or right, you have to acknowledge that they are things that are worth doing. Having a secure border so that people don't come into your country illegally is a basic duty of government. Economic prosperity is a basic duty of government. Withdrawing America from a kind of simultaneously aggressive but weak posture around the world where America sort of says, yeah, yeah, we're going to get involved in these foreign conflicts, 
[P17]  win that war is a kind of stupid position on both whichever side you're on. So on all of these things, and of course, you know, Scott mentioned wokeness. I think he's absolutely right that there is a massive backlash happening around the world because lots and lots of people who were completely apolitical until the last three or four years or maybe until 2016 just feel like the world has gone crazy and suddenly they're supposed to pretend that men can change sex and become women and now they're 
[P18]  entitled to be in female prisons. And, you know, if your teenager says that they are the opposite sex, you're supposed to chop their breasts off and all of this other stuff that ordinary people just look at and go, this is crazy. Like, I am liberal, but this isn't liberal. This is some kind of weird thing that's going on. And I see the backlash against all of that all over the Western world. And I think Donald Trump signifies that people are fed up of that. 
[P19]  that if the woke left continues to exercise this level of influence on our public debate, the reaction will be the rise of the right. And Donald Trump is one of the most diplomatic and pleasant versions of what you're likely to get if the left keeps going crazy. We will see what challenges the world throws at him over the next four years and whether he's capable of responding to them. 
[P20]  left lost its way in your view? And if so, how did that happen? And just to respond on some of Constantine's points about Trump being the best of a sort of right-wing collective, are we going to see right-wing sort of ideology spread throughout the Western world over the coming years? What's your take on all of the above? You definitely, you know, we Democrats, we get it right and then we just go too damn far. And so I look at, I'm a professor on a campus, 
[P21]  DEI, 60 years ago, there were 12 black people at Princeton, Yale, and Harvard combined. That was a problem. Race-based affirmative action makes sense. This year, more than half of Harvard's freshman class identifies as non-white. But 70% of those non-whites come from dual-income homes in the upper quintile of income-earning homes. The academic gap between black and white used to be double what it was between rich and poor. It's now flipped. So DEI was a good idea that, quite frankly, has gone insane 
[P22]  system it was trying to do away with. And then we created two candidates who were the only candidates who could make each other viable. Vice President Harris, given the hand she dealt with, did the best she did. I think President Biden should be buried in a crypt entitled narcissist who decided that it made sense for him to go back on his pledge to be a transition candidate and gave us a British-style election timing on the Democratic side in a marketplace. 
[P23]  or you need time and money. So it was not, we did not have a great candidate. There is an understandable swing back from what is an overcorrection around some of these issues. You know, parents, we gave them a huge issue with transgender rights. There's more Padel players in California than transgender people. And yet the Democrats decided to conflate it with the civil rights movement and think that it was okay for a woman who transitioned, a transgender woman, 
[P24]  enter a bicycle race and finish five minutes before everybody else, and then we all bark up the same tree and decide that it's inspiring. And parents all over the nation are saying, we've literally gone crazy. Where I would disagree a little bit with Constantine is that America choosing economic growth and prosperity, there are 190 sovereign nations in the world. 189 would change places with America over the last four years. We hit 71 new record highs in the markets, 97% of all AI. We've created more market capitalization 
[P25]  in a seven-mile radius of SFO International Airport than Europe's created in the last 20 years. We have the lowest inflation in the G7. We have the highest growth. We've grown 10% since 2020. That's triple the rate of Europe. Biden was unable to communicate any of that effectively because there's this psychological dynamic that when your wages go up, you credit your own grit and character, and when the price of cereal goes up, you blame the president. Now, similar to the future, or how William Gibson described the future, 
[P26]  It's here. It's just not evenly distributed. Prosperity is unprecedented in the U.S. over the last four years. It just wasn't evenly distributed. Now, having said that, in America, you can stop working in August and you've produced more and made more money than you have in Europe the whole year. And it has gotten better. It says things are less bad than anywhere in the world in the U.S. Biden was unable to communicate it. And then talking about how great the economy is when rents were skyrocketing, tuition was going up, it was an ineffective strategy. 
[P27]  But I don't think it's fair to say Americans chose prosperity. We have prosperity. 
[P28]  My favorite appointment in the Trump administration in the adult room is the 10 year bond, which is going to say, sorry, girlfriend, when I believe the president tries to implement some of these economic policies. Constantine, is that true? Because what I heard there is that effectively Trump had a better marketing campaign. And that reality is somewhat different from what the Americans were sold in the last election cycle. Well, politics is about marketing and Trump is the marketer in chief. 
[P29]  and partly that's what politics is about. But in terms of the economy, I think Scott is entirely right. It's one of the reasons I admire America so much, the sense of dynamism and economic growth and the desire to create things and build things. It's an observation I've had every time I've been there. You know, if you have a successful restaurant in the UK, you go, well, I've got a successful restaurant. In America, if you have a successful restaurant, you open a second one and a third one and you create a chain, right? So their attitude to business more broadly is, 
[P30]  is fantastic and I love it. But I think the difference is that I don't think Americans were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the European economies. They were comparing the American economy under Joe Biden to the American economy under Donald Trump in his first term and also what they expect him to do for the future. When they look at the fact that he's got real business leaders in government now, like Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk talking about government efficiency, 
[P31]  all Western countries have a massively bloated civil service, what we call civil service in the UK and the administrative state in the US that wastes a huge amount of money, that produces very little in terms of output in many cases. And that needs to be slimmed down. And people, I think, are very excited about that. And when I talk to business leaders in America, including ones that were never on the Trump train, so to speak, so many of them went over to his side in this election cycle. 
[P32]  because they just felt that he was going to continue to accelerate American growth and continue to deliver prosperity for the American people. Now, Scott's point about tariffs and all of these other things, you know, I've listened to Donald Trump enough now to know that you should not necessarily be taking him literally. I think many of the things he says are negotiation tactics and signaling. 
[P33]  build this or do that or do this. You have to sort of read between the lines when he says, you know, this will be the worst thing that you just go. He's saying to people like, you better work with me. Otherwise, this is going to work out badly for you on all of these things. And so it remains to be seen whether he's successful in those tactics of getting what he wants. Look, America is always going to be an unequal society. It's designed in a way that is going to make it that way. In America, the focus is how do we grow the pie? 
[P34]  In Europe, the focus is how do we divide it up so everyone gets their fair little share, right? So Americans are about expanding the pie and then the people who bake the pie get as much of it as they possibly can. But the question is, can there be a sense in America that the American dream is alive, that you do not have to work three gig economy jobs to pay your rent, that you're going to be able to buy a house, that you're going to be able to afford to have children, 
[P35]  raise a family, perhaps on a single income, something that most people only dream about nowadays. That's really what this whole economic conversation is about. And we will see over the next four years if Donald Trump is able to slightly even change the direction of travel towards those things that actually Americans of my generation and older used to take for granted as the promise of the country that they live in. I've thought a lot about this over the last couple of weeks in particular, 
[P36]  papers in the UK that millionaires are leaving the UK in historic numbers. I think it's 10,800 millionaires left last year, which is an increase of about 160% versus the previous year. And the general sentiment in terms of business confidence in the UK is at a several year low. So I think it's the lowest it's been since just post pandemic. There's this, I think it's the Institute of Accountants, they call up 1000 accountants every year, and they get they run a survey to see how much confidence 
[P37]  they have in business in this country. And it's fallen 14 points to 0.2% confidence in terms of business. But there's this bigger narrative emerging amongst my entrepreneurial friends that if you want to start a business right now, the best place to be in the world is to be in America, is to get over to America and to leave the UK. Now, Dan, how does that score? I know you have an accelerator, you speak to lots of entrepreneurs. How does that sort of compare or contrast with what you're seeing at the moment? Yeah, 100%. The value proposition for the UK has dropped through the floor. 
[P38]  Very, very high tax. The ecosystem of business is in decline. Some of the smartest people are now in Dubai. Some incredible creators that I know have moved to Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai. Many are going to the USA. So if people are interested in bigger markets and bigger opportunities, they're into the USA. If they're interested in lower tax and more fringe opportunities, they're in the Middle East. 
[P39]  a place in the world. I think there are three business models the UK could go for, which is either the head office of Europe, which is what we were when we were inside the EU, and everyone used to come here to build a European business. We could be the back office of the USA, so the incubator for the USA. A lot of smart companies get to their first 50 million of value here in the UK and then sell to a US private equity firm or US listed company. 
[P40]  And a lot of US companies are now actually coming here to poach talent or to outsource things to the UK more cheaply than they could do it in the US. The wages in the UK are through the floor compared to what you would pay in the US, especially in tech roles. So very smart people in the UK are massively devalued. 
[P41]  tax, model of Dubai, Singapore, you know, those kind of options. So we haven't really picked one of those three yet. We're still, you know, all these years after Brexit, and we haven't said which of those three models we want to adopt. Scott, you moved here a couple of years ago to the UK. And despite everything that's going on in the UK, are you still bullish on this being a place for entrepreneurship and business? I was looking at some stats 
[P42]  of key areas of concern for me. Business stats I've talked about there, the drop in business confidence, the entrepreneur exodus that we're seeing, but things like knife crime in the UK are up 81% over the last decade, which I think is a symptom probably of something else. And one of the big things I think a lot about as an entrepreneur at the moment is artificial intelligence. And our investment in artificial intelligence from a global perspective is down about 2000% versus a country like America. So you've moved here, you've brought your family here. 
[P43]  bullish on the UK versus the US from an entrepreneur's perspective? So the question I get most frequently when I speak here is to compare and contrast the US with the UK. And I use a personal anecdote. My parents immigrated to the US from Glasgow and London when they were 19 and 22. They took enormous risks. I've been an entrepreneur my whole life. I like to think that a lot of my success isn't my fault, that I inherited sort of that risk-taking DNA. And when I speak to people in the UK, I say the primary difference is 
[P44]  And that is, it kind of comes down to a risk appetite. The U.S. has five times per capita the number of entrepreneurs. It has five times the dollar volume per startup. There's $5 million in venture capital waiting to be deployed for every startup in the U.S. versus $1 million in Europe. I love what Constantine said about a restaurant. I went into this great little restaurant in Soho a few weeks ago called Dig In, and I loved it so much. I left my card and said, can you have the owner? 
[P45]  I'd like to open another one. Does he need money? I just would never do that here. I thought that was a really interesting insight. And the collision of risk, crazy ideas that occasionally become crazy genius and technology and intellectual property and great universities results in a company that no one had heard of five years ago being worth more than the entire UK stock market, NVIDIA. So there's just an enormous difference. 
[P46]  my impression of the UK economy, I'll just say London. I have no experience in it. I don't go anywhere that's not walking distance from Marlebone. So my bubble is pretty opaque. But the way I would describe the economy here is I love the term the butler economy. And that is all the money I see being made here is people servicing wealth created somewhere else. You're either in financial services servicing rich people. You're either opening a restaurant or hospitality. 
[P47]  quality servicing rich people, but I don't see a lot of organic wealth creation. I interviewed the two, quote unquote, inventors of AI at one of your prestigious universities. My first question is, how the hell were you not able to make any money if you invented AI? Why haven't you been able to capture any money? But just for your listeners, my summation of Europe versus the US after molesting the earth for the last 35 years is US is still the best place to make money and Europe is still the best place to spend it. Is this a failing nation, Scott? 
[P48]  I think you have too much going for you to be described as a failing nation. You still have amazing universities. London's still the second best city in the world. Premier League, it's an unbelievable export. I know how ridiculous that sounds. People want to be here. There's still rule of law, rule of play. You still produce amazing rock and roll. I just don't see how you could say this is a failed. I would argue that second only to our entry into Iraq, 
[P49]  An American can't understand why you would decide to increase your prices while reducing productivity in one fell swoop. It's difficult for us to wrap our heads around some of the economic decisions the UK has made. But I think a lot of people are kind of betting or hoping that the UK begins to grow again. So in a weird way, I would call myself cautiously optimistic about the UK. I think at some point it registers. 
[P50]  it begins to occupy the place it should command, if you will. Constantine, I would ask the same question to you as well. Do you think the UK is a failing nation? And Scott describes self-inflicted wounds there. I've heard you speak of self-inflicted wounds when you talk more broadly about the West and what the West needs to do to turn itself around. And also just layering a third point on top of that, which is somewhat linked to this, is Elon Musk has taken a particular interest in the UK over the last month in particular. 
[P51]  started to describe it online, it seems, as a failing nation. What's your view? Well, I'm glad you asked me about Elon Musk, because the thing that I love most about the media having this massive meltdown about, oh, no, these Americans are interfering in our political... These are the same media commentators who are constantly banging on about American politics and saying, Donald Trump needs to do this, you need to vote for this. Like, all of this stuff is ridiculous. The reality is we download our culture, our politics, 
[P52]  almost everything from America, right? America has become what Britain used to be, which is the center of Western civilization. And my request and ask and begging of British people is, if we're going to download American culture and politics, let's at least take the good stuff instead of all this terrible woke shit that we downloaded from them, the DEI and all this other nonsense, and actually take the entrepreneurial spirit and all these other things that are really great about America, the optimism, 
[P53]  the positivity, the willingness to have a go, to take a risk, as Scott was talking about. So I wish we took more of that. And it speaks to your question about are we a failing nation? Look, I think it's a deliberately inflammatory question, which I don't want to kind of actually accept in that way. But what I think we should acknowledge is are we trending up or are we trending down? And when you talk about over 10,000 millionaires, 
[P54]  have left. I hear that through a normal British person's ear. And I worry that there's quite a lot of British people who will hear that and say, oh, good, all of these rich parasites have left. Because that's our attitude in the UK to a very large extent. We see wealthy people not as what they are, which is for the most part, not everybody, but for the most part, people who've created a tremendous amount of value for their fellow human beings. And as a result of that, 
[P55]  have been rewarded. We see them because we, you know, we have this history of the landed gentry. And so to us, a millionaire is someone who has these ill-gotten gains that they don't deserve, right? That is not really the world we live in. When I talk to wealthy people in this country and pretty much everywhere else, for the most part, especially in the Western world, these are people who've created something that has fundamentally helped other human beings do something better, do something easier, 
[P56]  products, cheaper, whatever it is. That's who the successful people really are. And we just need an attitude shift. That's what we should be downloading from America. What we should be saying inside our heads is this person is successful because they've helped other people. Great. How do we get more of those people into our country? And I'm afraid I'm telling you something that you know better than anyone, Stephen. If you don't have entrepreneurs in your country creating businesses and creating jobs, 
[P57]  eternity. We have to get smart, talented, driven people into our country instead of chasing them out. Dan, I know this is a subject that you're very passionate about, and Konstantin's articulated it really, really well. I've seen lots of your posts about this subject, Dan. What are you seeing? And is it true that the British attitude is a form of self-harm that's holding us back from our potential? There are definitely attitudinal factors, but you'll also get the most incredibly entrepreneurial people here in London. London is a melting pot for 
[P58]  creativity. You've got sitting in one city, you've got people who are phenomenal at media, finance, technology, entertainment, politics, defense, like all of this. Like if you take the best of LA and Washington and New York and Miami and kind of start moving it into one city, you know, you get elements of that in London. It's a very diverse city from that point of view, and it creates an entrepreneurial melting pot. The issue is taxes. Nobody wants to pay 
[P59]  60% of their income in taxes. And as soon as you hit, you know, in the US, you don't hit the top tax rate until you are six times the average wage. Here in the UK, it's two and a half times. So as soon as you're two and a half times the average wage, you're in real trouble. There are so many people in the UK who deliberately hold their income at £50,000 because after £50,000, you get taxed 40% of your income. So people just give up and they say, I'm not going, I know some 
[P60]  really smart, really talented people who could be earning a lot more and they refuse to pay the 40% rate. So they like keep everything small because they don't want to go from 20 to 40% at the 50 grand rate, which is crazy. And I've employed people who have said, can I have a day off a week rather than going over that threshold? So, you know, that's a huge issue, the tax issue. The company rate tax is high. The corporate capital gains rate is taxed very high. The VAT is high. 
[P61]  The council tax is high. All of these additional taxes just keep piling up. And then the other cost at the moment, if we want to have an AI economy, we need cheap electricity. One thing that Trump has committed to is really, really cheap energy. There is no such thing as a fast growth, high octane economy that has expensive energy. Cheap energy equals fast growth. And we have the most expensive energy in the world. 
[P62]  Scott, you look like a lot of thoughts are going through your head following those two comments. What are you thinking? 
[P63]  that we have a housing crisis and that the executive order should have been around that. Just going back to the U.S., and I'm curious of the same dynamics and whether Constantine and Daniel agree with us. I believe this, the election in the U.S. was supposed to be a referendum on women's rights. Women's rights did not show up. This was a referendum on young men, in my view. And that is, if you look at the two cohorts that swung most from blue to red versus 2020, two of the three cohorts, other than Latinos, 
[P64]  was people under the age of 30 who in the U.S. are 24% less wealthy than they were 40 years ago, people over the age of 70 or 72% wealthier. Our tax code is basically an attempt to shove money from the young to the old. And two, 45 to 64-year-old women who I would affectionately describe as their mother. And that is when your son's in the basement vaping and playing video games, and I think a lot about struggling young men, you don't give a flying fuck about territorial sovereignty in the Ukraine, or Ukraine, excuse me, or transgender rights. 
[P65]  is your kid isn't doing well. And 210 times a day, your kid's getting a notification that somebody he knows is on a Gulfstream or partying in St. Bart's and it's not him or her. And so we not only have young people not doing as well, this pornographic wealth is just shoved in their face. And you end up with, in my opinion, kind of a young, struggling young man. No group has fallen further faster in the world, I would argue, than young men in America. 
[P66]  a morgue in the United States and there's five people who died by suicide, four of them are men. One in three men under the age of 30 has a girlfriend. Two in three women under the age of 30 has a boyfriend. Why? You think that's mathematically impossible? Because women are dating older because they want more economically and emotionally viable men. There's one in five men live at home at the age of 30. One in three under the age of 25. They're not having sex. They're more obese. They're more depressed. When women don't have a relationship, they oftentimes channel that energy 
[P67]  into their professional lives. More single women own homes in the U.S. than single men. Women in urban areas under the age of 30 are making more money than men. When men don't have the guardrails of a relationship or a job or being in school, they pour that energy sometimes into unproductive things, misogyny, nationalism or extreme nationalism, conspiracy theory. In some, they become really shitty citizens. They become sequestered from society. So I'm worried in the U.S., our biggest threat is a new species of asexual. 
[P68]  asocial young men who are incredibly dangerous have opted out of America. 60% of 30-year-olds used to have one child in America, and that's 27%. So people, I think, in the U.S., and this is a genuine question. I don't know if it's the same problem here. Our tax policies have taken money from the young, stuffed them in the pockets of old people so Nana and Pop-Pop can upgrade from Carnival to Crystal Cruises. Meanwhile, young people can't afford education. They can't afford housing. 
[P69]  And we especially see this really acute emerging crisis among young men who are just opting out of America, who don't even want to try and date, don't even want to enroll in school, don't want to even try and get a job, just stick in their basements and go on Reddit or Discord, or why go try and shower or work out and get a relationship when you have you porn? Why get a job when you can trade stocks or crypto on Coinbase or Robinhood? 
[P70]  In my opinion, this is the most dangerous trend in America right now. It was almost like demonizing men for decades has consequences. I mean, this is what's been happening. Men are the root of all evil, the root of all evil, the root of all evil. Every advert is about, you know, the woman is strong and capable. The guy's pathetic. In every movie, the woman's kicking ass and the man is pathetic. This has been going on for decades. It's a cultural thing as well as an economic thing. 
[P71]  meaning and opportunity away from men. If you create an education system that punishes boys for being boys, if you create a society in which traditional masculine virtues become vices, then you will create exactly the sort of thing that Scott is talking about. It's a terrible thing that's been done. Having said that, my message is always the same to young men who I hope are listening, which is the answer to your problems is never going to be, as Scott says, porn and this and that. 
[P72]  the answer to your problems is going to take responsibility, go out and get a job or create a business and actually make your life better. No one's coming to save you. No one's coming to help you. There is no, the sort of programs that we have for women where we sort of go, well, you know, let's give them an opportunity here. None of that's happening for men. It's not going to happen because for evolutionary reasons, we just don't feel sorry for men the way that we do for women. That's a reality. I know it sucks, 
[P73]  men is going to be the answer that's always been the answer for men, which is for you to get off the sofa, to get off the couch and go out and actually do and create and build and find your own way through it. Even if you have to acknowledge that the society you live in has been conditioned for quite a long time to think that you're a piece of shit because you happen to have the genitalia that you do. Now, that I think is the harsh reality of it. And I think Scott is right to point this out as a problem. And I hope that we start to have 
[P74]  both in terms of economic policy, but in terms of also just the cultural conversations and the way we talk about these issues, we come back to something that human beings have known through the entire history of our species, which is men and women are both good and need to work together in order to thrive and succeed together, in order to have families, in order to have children, and in order for us to have healthy communities and healthy societies. You need healthy femininity and you need healthy masculinity, and they need to come together and work together. 
[P75]  Together, that's what we're supposed to do. And these stupid gender wars and this idea that men as a group are this and women as a group are that, all of that just needs to end. I was watching last night as Trump sat there signing all of those executive orders. And I also watched his inauguration speak where he said, we will forge a society that is colourblind and merit-based. And he signed a bunch of executive orders last night to eliminate a variety of different DEI programmes in the federal government, 
[P76]  We've seen 
[P77]  whack DEI measures. So I think there's a lot of nuance here. I would argue in universities, DEI is used as a giant misdirect from people such as myself who are enforcers of the caste system and wake up every morning and look in the mirror and ask ourselves the same question. How do I increase my compensation while decreasing my accountability? And what I found is the ultimate strategy is to create an LVMH rejectionist bullshit, elitist strategy, where Dartmouth sits on a 
[P78]  endowment of $8 billion and lets in 500 kids. So the conversation around who gets in is a misdirect from the important question that is how many. If you are not growing your endowment or your freshman class faster than population, you should lose your tax-free status. We should be letting in more gay kids, more trans kids, more white Republicans from rural state. You know who doesn't talk about DEI? Junior colleges, because there's no admissions. They don't have a problem with DEI. 
[P79]  own tail, started out with the right idea. Now it's nothing. And I would argue the same is somewhat true of the Democratic Party. I went to the Democratic National Convention. On the dnc.org website, it lists 17 special introscripts, and it says explicitly who we serve, Asian Pacific Islanders, seniors, veterans, Black Americans, the disabled. It basically lists, I added this up, 76% of the population. And when you say you're actively advocating for 76% 
[P80]  of the population. You're not advocating for 76% of the population. You're discriminating against the 24%. It's gone too far. I would argue in the workplace, having served on seven public company boards, and I'm going to do a lot of boasting here because I'm desperate for all of your affirmation, and 12 private company boards, there's still work to be done in the private sector. There still is a cycle. 40% of all venture capitalists and probably 70% or 80% of all venture capital deployed 
[P81]  are white guys from just two universities, Stanford and Harvard. So I would argue universities, it's gotten out of control. I'd love to see the DEI apparatus disassembled, along with the ethics department, the sustainability department, the leadership department. These are all bullshit where we hire formerly important people with no standards. They never get fired. It just translates to more student debt. In the boardroom, in corporations, in certain sectors, I do think there is a need to be thoughtful about broadening the aperture of the lens 
[P82]  people who are underrepresented. There's still a dearth of women raising venture capital. So I think it's nuanced based on sector. But to just say all DEI is bad, I want to move to where the University of California did in 1997. They don't have race-based affirmative action. They have adversity-based affirmative action. I'm a beneficiary of affirmative action. I had something called Pell Grants. I was raised by a single immigrant mother who lived and died as secretary. So I got grants. I had 
[P83]  unfair advantage because I came from a household that was low income. And I think that there should be affirmative action. And I think it should be based on color, but that color is green. The poor need our help. The moment you start advocating for a special advantage based on any external factors, I think at this point in our society, it probably causes more problems than it solves. That's exactly right. That's exactly right, Stephen. 
[P84]  take a step back and look at why DEI has become such a big part of the conversation, it's precisely because instead of addressing the reality of people's lives, which is some people are disadvantaged and some people are advantaged, actually what we've mainly done, and Scott alluded to at the very beginning of our discussion, is we've given a leg up to very wealthy ethnic minority people from successful families, and they now, their children now get into 
[P85]  prestigious universities, which they probably would have done anyway, some of them, because they come from very advanced backgrounds. And the kids that are growing up in poverty, black and white, have no shot whatsoever. But the reason that it's become such a big issue around the Western world, actually, I don't think it's the nuances that we've delved into here, but actually something else, which is we have created the most ethnically diverse societies in history. And what I mean by that is, 
[P86]  not that we've created societies in which there are large groups of people who are different from each other, but for the first time probably in human history, we've created societies in which there is a lot of ethnic diversity and there is no overt discrimination against some groups of people in the sense of, you know, the imperial societies in the past would have had one dominant ethnic group, which is, you know, the Russians in the Soviet Union or the Turks in the Ottoman Empire 
[P87]  in the British Empire, whatever. That was the ethnic group that was like the dominant one. And everybody else was a kind of second-class citizen and everybody knew it, right? We don't have that anymore. We have highly diverse societies where people of every single background exist in which we have this idea that we're all supposed to be equal. And when we have programs that explicitly discriminate against people, there were times when the discrimination was explicit 
[P88]  black people. Well, we've gone full circle now where the discrimination was going the other way in university admissions, in hiring, in corporate America, in government, in all sorts of things. You know, in this country, the BBC has internships that aren't available to white people, etc. When you get to that point, as Scott said earlier on, everyone just goes, look, I know I'm not supposed to say this, but the reality is this is racism. This is a form of racism. And I thought we were trying to get away from the 
[P89]  So to the extent that the elimination of DEI is about creating a merit-based society in which people are given an opportunity because they're skilled and talented and they have the potential to actually achieve things and create wealth. You know, we all know this. We all employ people, right? How many of us are thinking about the races of the people we hire? I don't think we think about that at all. What we're thinking about is I run a business. I need the very best personable. 
[P90]  very best possible person for this job at the price I'm willing to pay. I don't care if they are purple, green, blue, white, whatever. It doesn't matter. What matters is, are we getting the best person for the job? And my concern about identity politics has always been that if we do not adopt that worldview, then what we will do is create a worldview in which we have different racial groups competing with each other on the basis of race. 
[P91]  very dangerous mix for a multi-ethnic society like ours, which is why I've been begging people to let go of this stupid idea of identity politics and to say, first and foremost, we are all Brits or we are all Americans. We have this umbrella identity under which we all operate and our personal ethnicity or sex or whatever is secondary to that and actually for the purposes of employment, for the purposes of college admission, et cetera, is irrelevant. 
[P92]  Yes, if there is disadvantage, if we grew up in a single-parent home with a low income, we may need some extra support there. If we had terrible schooling or our education was not good, we may need extra support. If there's certain things that make it easier for us because of the disadvantages we've had to fulfill our talent and potential, I am all for that. But what we've created so far, and that's why I'm delighted it's being eliminated, is an anti-meritocratic system which says, 
[P93]  We don't care what you bring to the workplace. We don't care whether you deserve this place or not. We don't care about the potential you have. Actually, we just needed an insert category tick box to fill this slot. And you filled it. It doesn't really matter that you're not doing your job very well because now we can say, you know, we're a diverse company. I don't care about that and we shouldn't care about that as a society. And thank God that's now gone. Yeah, I think the worst part about it too is that it calls into question 
[P94]  and they're from a diverse background, you know, it calls into question why they got that job in the first place, which I think is horrible. You know, I just hired from two candidates, the final two candidates was a guy and a woman. I would hate if the woman felt that she got the job because she's a woman and not because she's best. She turns out she was by far the best in the process. And I would love for her to know that there was absolutely nothing that changed our view. 
[P95]  We weren't trying to fill a position with a woman. We were trying to fill the position with the best, and she should know she was the best. I think the contrast that was really fascinating was between Trump's website and the Democrats' website. So in the Democrats' website, it was who we're for, which was what Scott was saying. But Trump's website was the 20 things we're going to do, and it was just a list of 20. These are the 20 action points. This is what we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this. 
[P96]  as opposed to the identities that we want to advantage list. And I think that was the choice. You know, at the beginning, Constantine, you said, you know, America had a choice. And for me, when I looked at those two websites, I saw this choice between the identities being the main thing or the to-do list being the main thing and very different approaches. Scott, when I was listening to that Zuckerberg interview talking about masculinity and identity issues, one of the lines he said in there, 
[P97]  like something you've said on my show before, where he said, I think having a culture that celebrates that aggression a little bit more, talking about masculinity, has its own merits that are really positive. Now, Mark Zuckerberg isn't necessarily someone that I saw closely aligning to your worldview. Am I right in thinking that that's something you agree with? Because I remember you saying to me, you think people should be able to walk in a room and kick everyone's ass. What I've said on your show is that I think the male form, especially under the age of 30, 
[P98]  with its bone structure, incredible double-twitch muscle, and then this amazing, amazing chemical called testosterone, you're going to look back at your 25-year-old self and think, why wasn't I a fucking monster like Steve Barley? And also, there is some masculinity when Russian soldiers pour over the border in Ukraine. You want some of that big dick energy that Daniel was talking about. In the case of Zuckerberg, 
[P99]  I don't think he really understands an aspirational view of masculinity. I think when he couches immediately kind of trying to kiss Trump's ass because Trump threatened to put him in prison, and what he used to call moderation, he's now calling censorship. And when you have an algorithm that elevates incendiary hateful content, I would not describe that as masculinity. For me, masculinity comes down to protection, providing, and procreation. 
[P100]  Iадib Axel- He's about gendering a workplace in the context of trying to excuse a total elimination of what I would think is probably healthy moderation. I imagine Daniel and Constantine might have a different view. 
[P101]  Right now, when I talk about masculinity, you know, there's if I say at a conference, oh, women are better managers. Everyone goes, yes, that's right. That's right. Right. That's OK. If I say men are more risk aggressive and make better entrepreneurs, you're a misogynist. You're out. And the reality is men and women bring different attributes. But the masculinity and femininity, I think masculinity is a wonderful thing. I think we need a different image of it. I think people born as male have an easier time leaning into those things. 
[P102]  I work out at CrossFit with a bunch of lesbian firefighters. They bring great masculine energy, and they could carry my ass out of a fire. So a lot of men demonstrate wonderful feminine qualities. A lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculine qualities. I don't think these things are sequestered to anyone born as a specific gender. What I think, when I talk about masculinity, I don't talk about it in the role of corporations. I think that's as fraught with risk and not worth talking about. It should be about shareholder value or stakeholder value. 
[P103]  I think young men need a code. We're going to church less. We have fewer relationships. So what's the code you hold on to in terms of creating behaviors that are productive for you, yourself, society? And I think masculinity needs to be redefined as something more aspirational where you're celebrated for being really fucking strong. You're celebrated for not complaining. You're celebrated for creating surplus value. You create more tax revenue than you absorb. You're celebrated for being aggressive. You're celebrated for breaking up fights at bars. 
[P104]  not starting them. You're celebrated for protecting your country, not shitposting it. You're celebrated for approaching strange women and expressing romantic interest. That's not a crime. And if she's not interested and you're rejected, you're both going to be fine. You're celebrated for getting out of the house. You're celebrated for working. You're celebrated for making money and liking money. I think there just needs to be a redefinition of masculinity in the context of helping young men 
[P105]  code that they used to get from the armed services or from dual parent households. And I feel like they're struggling. So I like the idea of something that they feel in their bones and in their body and in their DNA that they can lean into that we celebrate. And the conversation is flipped entirely. Five years ago, I was called a misogynist for talking about masculinity. Now the conversation is being led and advocated by one group, and it's mothers who are like, 
[P106]  My son is not doing well. I got three kids, two daughters, daughters in PR with the other ones at Penn, and my son is in the basement vaping and playing video games. He needs something to latch on to. He needs a code. Anyways, but I apologize. Word salad. Zuckerberg and masculinity, give me a fucking break. He looks like a Chechen Molly dealer. Sorry, back to you, Stephen. Well, it's interesting when you speak, Scott, because your views on masculinity 
[P107]  me to be most better represented by the right side of politics than the left side of politics. They both have their own vision of masculinity. And yours seems to be a Republican view of masculinity. To Trump's credit, he saw the opportunity and he flew right into the manosphere. Rockets, crypto, Joe Rogan, Theo Vaughn. He said, no, I'm not going to run from this. I'm going to fly right into it. Now, I would argue that his vision of masculinity has too much 
[P108]  coarseness, too much cruelty, too much bullying. I don't think that's masculinity. I think when we talk about Elon Musk taking risks, sending rockets that are captured by scissors coming down, inspiring the EV race, taking an enormous risk, making a shit ton of money. Yeah, that's a great form of masculinity. Accusing men trying to save high soccer players, calling them pedophiles, calling your employees a sex criminal such that they have to leave their house, having 13 kids by five women or three women, none of which you live with, 
[P109]  Sleeping next to a loaded gun, losing control of your self-control because of addiction. I don't think that's a great role model. I think it's an amazing role model for boys. I don't think it's a great role model for men. In terms of energy, there are so many reasons why I'm a big matcha fan, if you don't already know by now. And so much so that I actually invested in the UK's leading matcha company called Perfect Ted. And one of my favorite Perfect Ted products is these delicious matcha pouches that come in every flavor from salted caramel, 
[P110]  to peach flavor, to mint flavor, to berry flavor. One of my favorites is this vanilla flavor, which I'm going to make in just two seconds. You just take this mixer here, get a little bit of the powder, pop it on top of the shaker like that. Put the lid on. Shake, shake, shake. Delicious. If you haven't tried this yet, you can find Perfect Ted at Tesco and Holland Barrett stores or online where you can get 40% off with my code, Diary40. 
[P111]  put in code Diary40 to try this delicious multi-flavored matcha now. Highly recommend. And if you do it, please tag me, send me a message online. Do you know that 80% of New Year's resolutions fail by February? It's because we focus too much on the end goal and we forget the small daily actions that actually move us forward. Those actions that are easy to do are also easy not to do in life. It's easy to save a dollar, so it's also easy not to. Making one small improvement each day, one tiny step in the right direction, has a big difference over time. 
[P112]  mindset, which is why we created The 1% Diary, a 90-day journal designed to help you stay consistent and focus on the small wins and make real progress over time. It also gives you access to The 1% Community, a space where you can stay accountable, motivated, inspired, along with many others on the same journey. We launched The 1% Diary in November and it sold out. So now we're doing a second drop. Head to thediary.com to grab yours before it sells out again. I'll put the link below. 
[P113]  Censorship. The word censorship was used there by Scott. We've seen this reversal in Meta's attitude, Facebook's attitude that had been built up over a decade, where it almost felt like if you had sort of right-leaning views or really any unaccepted views and you posted those on Facebook, you would face maybe having the post deleted or your account suspended. This new world of speech, of free speech, and as it pertains to masculinity. 
[P114]  noticed, Scott, you'd left X. You no longer post or tweet on X anymore. Do you think Elon's decision to buy X is a net positive for society? Net, yes. But I think what people hear when you say that is there's no problems with this system than, you know, compared to the ones we had before. There are definitely disadvantages to a free platform like X now. And one of them is 
[P115]  inevitably when you remove censorship, one of the things the censorship was doing was keeping all the deeply unpleasant people away from being able to shove things in your face. And that happens quite a lot on it. So I don't enjoy that aspect of it. But I've always said that would be the price that we would pay for freedom. Freedom always has a price, and that's what we're seeing. As for Zuckerberg, his miraculous transformation into a free speech warrior 
[P116]  And I'm delighted to welcome him. I'm sure it's entirely genuine and not anything to do with the election results we've just seen in any way whatsoever. And the fact that the culture shifted and those of us who were being censored by people like him for years actually winning the argument. Well, what it shows you is we've won the argument on free speech when it comes to the big tech platforms. And it's going to be messy. 
[P117]  that are algorithmically driven, where the truth and the moderate reasonable take is not what usually gets attention, you're going to see a lot of unpleasantness. I value the ability to hear and communicate truthful ideas and facts over my own subjective feelings. Oh, someone said a thing I don't like or someone was racist or someone was misogynistic. I don't enjoy the fact that that happens. 
[P118]  but I would rather that happened and also we were not being censored from saying, you know, COVID probably came from a lab in China, which we were. You know, the Hunter Biden laptop story isn't Russian disinformation. Actually, it's an important piece of information that American voters need to hear when they're making their decision about the election. And all of these other things that were being suppressed and censored across social media for years, they're not anymore. 
[P119]  that's a good thing. And I think that's helpful. And if you look at, you know, to bring it back to the UK for a moment, Stephen, as you know, on Trigonometry, we've tried to cover the grooming gangs scandal and is an outrage what happened in this country over decades. We've been covering that for years, since about 2019, 2020, to very little purchase. And one of the reasons is it was just something that the media sort of covered and then moved on, when it actually should have been something we talked about on 
[P120]  daily basis until serious action was taken. And we saw real, real change, real change in policing, real change in social work, real change in government, real change in the way that these racially aggravated hate crimes were treated. Well, none of that was really being talked about seriously until Elon kicked up a fuss, amplified the voices of survivors, amplified the voices of campaigners on X, which he bought. And now the British government is forced 
[P121]  to do whatever it can to actually address those issues to the extent that it will. A lot of people will say it still doesn't go far enough. Well, if it doesn't go far enough, we now have a platform from which we can continue to have that conversation until there is the sort of inquiry and the sort of outcomes that people want to actually deliver real change. So is that a positive? God, yes. God, yes. We needed that. 
[P122]  by someone like Elon Musk on a platform like X, which is now free, to the point where Keir Starmer is forced into defensive action. I wish that was around 30 years ago because a hell of a lot of young girls and women wouldn't have suffered the way they did if we had the opportunity to get that message out. So, God, yes, it's a net positive. Just to pick up on that, Constantine, I've had a question in my mind for a while regarding the scandal, which is horrific, I think it's something we all definitely agree on, is why has Elon chosen 
[P123]  now? And why has he chosen Keir Starmer as the sort of central target of this flurry of tweets around the grooming scandals? Because there's clearly, Elon's, I think, an individual which you can kind of see thinking in real time. Like if you go back through his tweets, because there's so many of them, and they kind of come in these spurts, you can almost see what he's getting at. Is there an underlying reason why he's made this a central issue over the last couple of weeks? 
[P124]  is actually most Americans were completely unaware of this issue until recently. I remember a year ago speaking at a private event in New York and somebody said to me, well, you know, what is the consequence of political correctness? Why are you so against it? Why are you so against censorship? And I talked about the grooming gangs and people were horrified. They hadn't even, and these are well-informed, educated people who are media savvy and whatever. So one of the reasons is I think to a lot of Americans, this issue is only coming to the fore. 
[P125]  now in front of their mind. The second issue, I think, is that Elon Musk understands what I said earlier, which is we have a global Western culture now. And so what happens in Britain matters just as much as what happens in America, because we are symbiotic with each other now. When there's a restriction of speech in the UK, when we have laws about what people are not allowed to say, that has an impact across the world. When you see the European Union trying to pass legislation, 
[P126]  about online censorship. That has an impact because if something exists in the UK and in many European countries, it's only a matter of time before people in America are going to say, well, look, they've got this in Europe. Why don't we bring it over here? And vice versa. So what happens in America affects us in Europe and in the UK. And what happens in Europe and the UK affects America. So what Elon, I think, is trying to do is to say, we care about our civilization. Elon doesn't really talk that much about the United States. 
[P127]  about our civilization as I do, because I believe that we are now one thing to a very significant extent. Now, from our civilizational point of view, is it a good thing that mass rape gangs in the UK are being insufficiently investigated and treated improperly by the police and the government? No, it's not. It's a very bad thing. So how do we address that? Well, we address that by putting pressure on the government of the day. Now, I don't see the grooming gangs as a party political issue. 
[P128]  it properly, although there were individual members of the cabinet that tried to do something like Sir Le Braverman. But he's putting pressure on the government of the day. You can see him going after Nigel Farage, of all people, and saying Nigel Farage is not the right leader for reform. So he's attempting to shape British politics in the direction that he feels is the right way. What does he want? What outcome does he want? Look, I don't know what Elon Musk wants. I don't know him personally. I haven't even yet had a chance 
[P129]  to interview him, which I really look forward to doing, because I think he's one of the great visionaries of our time. Whether you like him or not, I think that's undeniably true. But my sense is he's trying to talk about all the things that we've been discussing, freedom of expression, the end of identity politics and the pursuit of meritocracy, a pioneering, inspiring vision of the future, which is why he's talking about Mars and a vision for our civilization that goes beyond the narrow squabbling 
[P130]  here on Earth. And the understanding that human beings are meant, we left the cave. We're not supposed to stay in a place with the walls closing in on us and feel like we're in decline. We're not supposed to be a civilization that has 1.5 children per woman and that is simply just leaving the planet Earth because we can't reproduce. We're supposed to look at the future with hope and optimism. We're supposed to say, 
[P131]  I want things to be better for my children. I want to have children. I want the vision of our society being one of positivity and optimism and a sense of a pioneering vision and inspiration. That's what I think he wants. And I don't really see any of that in the current government in the UK. And I think he's right to go after them and say, you are destroying your country's economy. You're destroying its culture. You're destroying its sense of cohesiveness by allowing illegal immigration. 
[P132]  You are destroying that sense of optimism and vision. And you're not saying to people, let's build something better. You're saying, let's stay small. Let's play small. Let's not rise above our station. And I think we need people like that, imperfect as they may be in all sorts of different ways, to drive our civilization forward, to say to us, there is an inspiring vision to which we're all moving, as opposed to just sitting there and waiting to die, which is what we've been doing for far too long. 
[P133]  I think Elon is taking him at his word. You know, he said a year ago that he was going to absolutely dismantle the woke mind virus globally and he was going to ensure meritocracy and free speech. And when he sets his mind on something, he has the ability to stay focused on it for a very long time to a degree most people can't fathom. You know, and he's absolutely willing to endure pain. He loves a fight. He obviously has the kind of mind that can't relax unless he's kind of grinding up against some gear. 
[P134]  as well. Like the way he works needs stress in his life. He needs a big enemy. He needs a big fight to engage with. And I think Keir Starmer just ticked all of his boxes as someone to go up against. I think what's interesting is we talk about these big tech. I love that Scott has previously talked about breaking up big tech. And I think there's potential for that in the next four years. All of these guys like Trump and JD Vance and all of them have locked horns with big tech. 
[P135]  and they've come, you know, this is their chance to get revenge on big tech in the next four years. They could do a little, you know, you might see Google have to, you know, spin off YouTube or you might see AWS have to come away from Amazon or something like that. Who knows? But it's interesting that a lot of these big tech guys, they're probably cozying up to Trump because, you know, that could be on the cards as well. There's been a lot of Trump butt kissing over the last couple of weeks. 
[P136]  bragged about the fact that everybody's flown down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss his butt and to cozy up with him. And there's now headlines saying that there's this tech oligarchy forming in the United States where Bezos and Elon and Zuck are all now friends and they're stood behind Trump as this unifying force. Just to touch on a few points of that, but also on Constantine's message that Elon is doing this for the betterment of humanity, to further humanity, his involvement with the UK, but his broader involvement in politics now. Scott, does that square with how you think about Elon? 
[P137]  And I am quite curious to ask you why you made the decision to leave X and to go to Blue Sky and Threads and things like that. Yeah, I can't speculate on what motivates Elon Musk. I quite frankly just don't get the guy. And I don't have the domain expertise to comment on the rape gangs. It's such a serious, upsetting issue. I don't know it well enough to speak intelligently to it. Just the topic of censorship, though, as it relates to meta, 
[P138]  A hallmark of a free society and a democracy is that pretty much anyone can say pretty much anything about pretty much anybody. I believe that. The question is, do machines and bots have free speech rights? Because if I say something, I believe, and I may be paranoid, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong. I believe VCs whose portfolio companies I've said have overvalued have enlisted thousands of bots to basically just shitpost me over and over on X to diminish my credibility. 
[P139]  critical of Putin that the GRU has hired troll farms to create lists of thousands of people to weaponize bots to say disparaging things about them. Do those bots have free speech rights? In addition, when Fox News distributes information to its anchors saying Dominion voting machines were weaponized by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, despite the fact they knew that was not true, but they tell their broadcasters to do it anyways. And then Dominion says, this hurt our business. 
[P140]  and you knew it was false, and you decided to communicate it anyways, courts find them liable. They have to pay three quarters of a billion dollars. What happened at Fox News was a dumpster fire compared to the nuclear mushroom cloud on Meta. So a lot of what we're talking about here, if you want to say that mRNA vaccines alter your DNA, I think you should have the right to say that. The dissenter's voice is important because occasionally the conspiracy theorist ends up being correct. 
[P141]  is, when you have a business model that elevates the most incendiary, ugly content beyond its organic reach, should you then be exonerated from all liability and slander that traditional media companies are liable to? If we were to say that Elon Musk is a pedophile and start stating facts and evidence of it, and he could show that it's hurt his ability to raise money for Tesla, and he filed legal action against this podcast, 
[P142]  I think we would be in a world of hurt, and that legal liability is warranted. But the most powerful media companies in the world have Section 230 protection, so they have a business model where conspiracy theory or novel content, which is Latin for bullshit and lies, and the more angry it is, it gets elevated beyond its organic reach. So while I'm kind of down with the notion that we should have free speech and anybody should be able to say pretty much whatever they want, 
[P143]  There's something wrong when we have algorithms that have a profit incentive around rage, conspiracy theory, and lies, and two-thirds of Republicans believe that the election was stolen, when one in five Americans think that 9-11 was an inside job. Let's be honest. They thought that before the internet. I remember watching all the 9-11 truth of movies and all of that. But your point overall is right. I totally agree. 
[P144]  Wait, Elon agrees with you. When he bought X, he talked about the bot problem. He talked about the amplification of outrage. He hasn't done as much as I hoped he would have done so far, but I hope that they do address that because that isn't an Elon or an X problem. It's a technology problem of the modern world. The reality is that the more we live our lives online, the more you're going to have the problem of the ability of foreign governments, of individual people to create fake accounts, 
[P145]  bot farms, et cetera, to influence the way we look at all of these things. And we are going to have to come to terms with that reality because it's a technological issue that we're going to have to solve for and we haven't yet. It's also very easy for people to get caught in their own bubbles as well, which is a new phenomenon. There was a time where if you believed crazy things, you still had to sit next to someone else in church and talk to them about their life and what they believe. And you encountered dissenting voices. 
[P146]  encountered sane, rational people who had very different views to you that you had to be friends with long term. Whereas where we are right now is if you've got some sort of crazy view, you can find yourself only talking to people who share those views and only sharing content that reinforces those views until such time that you become extremely radicalized. I think that's such an important point because I think it's a real shame that AI LLMs aren't crawling the real world. I was at Granger's yesterday. Someone comes up to me. 
[P147]  Love your content. Let's take a picture. They're so nice. Another person comes up to me and says, I disagree with your view on this, but we have a civil conversation. And then I come home to 40 bots telling me I'm Professor Genocide. I mean, people in the real world, generally speaking, I don't know if it's because of the threat of physical violence, or they want to have sex with you, or maybe they think at some point you'll hire their kid, or generally just a comity of man. But people in real life, I find, are just lovely and wonderful. And it's a shame that these LLMs aren't calling this. 
[P148]  because the treif and some of the vile shit they're crawling online, which I don't even think reflects our species. I think it reflects technology that has a profit motive around promoting the most incendiary, hateful content. So there's got to be some sort of medium speed here. And also, I got off X, Steve, because you don't like Chick-fil-A, don't eat a Chick-fil-A. If Musk wants to pay $44 billion and turn it into a Nazi porn bar, that's his right. 
[P149]  illegal. I don't think the government should step in. But I don't have to paint his fence. And I can go to another platform. That's my right, too. And everyone says, oh, you're against free speech. I'm like, no, I'm not. I'm against being on a platform that makes me feel bad. So he has the right. And all this notion around meta, free speech, it's a little different because they control so much of the media. But these are media companies, and they should be liable for slander or defamation, the same way traditional media companies are in 
[P150]  I think we could solve a lot of this problem by just removing 230 protections for algorithmically elevated content. If you decide to elevate content beyond its organic reach, then you are making an editorial decision and you should be liable if that, in fact, is slanderous or defamatory. I think that's really fascinating as a way of handling it. And also, we're living in a world where, as of this year, some of the most phenomenal content you will read will be algorithmic. 
[P151]  generated and some of the most compelling content. So this idea that Scott's talking about, should bots have free speech? It sounds like a kind of, you know, intellectual kind of pseudo intellectual topic, but it's absolutely a very practical topic in the sense that bots now can generate conversations very easily. And some of the, you know, you could spend all day talking to a bot and not know. It's funny, this is this subject has come up because in the last week, I've had a flurry of messages on 
[P152]  WhatsApp from friends. I actually had two tweets yesterday, which you could probably see if you just search my name. Because on X at the moment, there's multiple ads running that are fake articles with fake BBC headlines with my face in. So it says things like, the Bank of England is suing Steve Bartlett. And this is running as a sponsored ad on X. And people are tweeting me these things. My friend says every time he refreshes the feed, he sees a new sponsored ad of a fake article of me. And sometimes it's like, can't believe this happened to Steve. And it's a BBC article. 
[P153]  you click on it, you get scammed. I think it's a crypto scam. I don't want to click. I'll send the link to you guys so you can click on it for me. But I just, it really has, because that is a bot. There's multiple of them, multiple accounts that have been spun up. They're all verified accounts. And it's AI generated imagery with a paid ad behind it. That's the bit that really gets me. I get people can post shit, but sponsoring it is a new level of defamation. One of the big macro things I've been thinking a lot about 
[P154]  haven't shared yet, is just the amount of social networks that have emerged. In the last 10 years, there's been a 50% increase so far in new social networks that have emerged. And we're seeing this splintering now of the rumbles, the blue skies, the threads. And it almost seems, talking about echo chambers, that social networks are becoming sort of political environments. And you're choosing your social network now based on your politics. This doesn't seem like a net positive thing for society. 
[P155]  argumentation of our reality. And it comes, you know, Scott's point about people behaving better in person is true. Although I would say there is the windscreen effect or the windshield effect, which is if someone cuts you up in traffic and you feel that there's some kind of physical separation between the two of you, most people behave slightly differently in that context than they would if they were sitting next to somebody face to face in a bar. So there's something about being physically present with other people that changes it, 
[P156]  one of the reasons, you know, I know you have pretty much all your interviews face to face and we do as well, because I generally speaking, it's very difficult to connect authentically with people. Obviously, we've managed to do it in the course of this conversation, but beyond that, it's difficult. And so we're going to have to work on that. But I just what the point I'm trying to make is this isn't a political issue. It's not an X issue. It's not an Elon Musk issue. It's a technological issue. We're living through 
[P157]  probably already have lived through most of the digital revolution. And I used to, as a kid, love Isaac Asimov science fiction books. And one of the reasons I did enjoy reading them so much is it was a world in which there was an exploration of what does the creation of robots, which is what we're living through, mean for morality? What does it mean for philosophy? What does it mean for humanity? What does it mean for, how do we build rules in a world 
[P158]  in which you have these machines that take every rule literally and suddenly you find that, you know, the desire to protect humanity results in the end of humanity. How do you navigate all of this? And that is what we're living through. We are also living through a period when our realities are being fragmented. And so we believe a very small set of things that other people like us somewhere in a very different part of the world, as Daniel was saying earlier, 
[P159]  believe, and we now live in this, we don't live in England or in Scotland or in America. We live almost like in a world of people who think like us in the West. And then other people live right next door to us who live in a whole different world because they consume a whole different set of information. That is the reality. We can complain about it. That is not going to change. And the only thing I really want to, 
[P160]  raise where I disagree with Scott about this idea that Facebook and X, et cetera, they are publishers and not platforms. I don't think you can apply the same media organization section to them. I don't think it's appropriate. They are platforms in which people publish information. The artificial amplification is a fair point. We need to deal with that. We need to deal with the bot problem. 
[P161]  That's a very difficult one because one of the challenges is the only way to really deal that I can see with the bot problem is to get people to verify their identity online. That obviously has a lot of questions around that because once you start forcing people to give their identity over to some anonymous blob online, who's collecting that data? What are they doing with it? 
[P162]  then the question for you is, well, you know, let's say right now I look at Twitter and I'm like, yeah, I'm happy to verify my identity. I'm happy to confirm who I am. Well, what if, you know, George Soros buys X off Elon at some point? Are you still happy that that information is being held? Are you still happy that the anonymous account you've now made confirmed? You know, what happens to the anonymous activists speaking about the Ayatollah's regime in Iran? 
[P163]  identity and the wrong person buys that platform or someone hacks it, et cetera. So it's a conversation that's not, if there were easier solutions on these issues, they would have been solved by now. This is a very difficult thing for humanity to navigate, and we're going to have to find a way to do it, and incrementally so. I just want to respond to that. I think you're guilty of the same illusion of complexity that protects these companies from acting like actors such that they can do anything regardless of the damage to the commonwealth to add shareholder value. 
[P164]  If you implemented, we have, first off, this notion that you don't want to give up your identity. Trust me, they know everything about you, Constantine, already. And I could go get a ton of information on you from the dark web fairly easily with a credit card. So the notion that somehow we shouldn't have some sort of, you could have, we need age verification for social media. There's no reason anyone in the age of 16 should be on a social media platform. And regarding the, 
[P165]  the civil rights activist or the women's rights activist that needs an anonymity, you could create a number of accounts and use blockchain or some sort of third-party anonymous to have a certain number of accounts that says, look, if you want an anonymous parody account, you want to make fun of people, fine. If you want an account talking about issues that you feel are sensitive from other markets, fine. We could absolutely figure that out and then figure out, okay, this account is doing nothing. It has no base. It has no soul. 
[P166]  values. It has 72 followers. All it's doing is trying to start fights online. All it's doing is trying to make people feel shitty about Britain or shitty about America. And the reality is these companies use that illusion of complexity such that they can have more bots creating more fake clicks, more Nissan ads, and more shareholder value. I think there's a middle ground here. I think we could figure this out. I agree. Well, that's what I'm saying. I think some of the ideas that you're putting forward, right or wrong, I don't know. 
[P167]  conversations we should be having. How do we make sure? I mean, my son is two and a half years old. And if my wife has become a complete screen Nazi, so he's probably not going to get a phone until he's about 40. But I think your point about people shouldn't be on social media. People shouldn't be on social media until they're 16. Absolutely correct. What that's doing to the minds of, well, or everybody, but particularly young people who are really susceptible to it. 
[P168]  The verification dimension is difficult, as I say. We're going to have to hash this all out as humanity. We're just going to have to work this all out. How do we live in this new world that we now live in? It's going to take some time. And I hope it's not as bad as the last time the information space was revolutionized, which was the printing press. That caused about two centuries of religious war. Hopefully we can avoid that. And part of the way to do that is to create environments which are uncensored, 
[P169]  People can express different ideas. We can have these battles and eventually come to some sort of mutual understanding. I hope that happens. What I wanted to ask you all to really close out this conversation was these conversations tend to be a bit of a reflection of what's in the news cycle and what's in the news cycle tends to be a reflection of what people are clicking. And a lot of that's driven by fear and the sort of narrative of the time, whether it's immigration or the Trump inauguration. But what is the big important idea that we're not talking about? 
[P170]  what's the most important thing that we should be talking about that isn't getting enough attention right now as it relates to the future of the West? And that's a big, broad question. I'll start with you, Daniel. For me, it's the schooling system. I think the schooling system is not preparing people for a world that exists and that we're teaching. You know, we haven't grasped the fact that AI is going to be the biggest, most disruptive technology in the lives of our children 
[P171]  into probably won't exist. We need to have a radical look at this idea that children should go to school with the same age groups or study a certain set of topics or that it should be topic-based at all. We need to explore, you know, are there better models for the schooling system that prepare people for the world that we're going to be in? Our current schooling system goes back to the early 1800s. 
[P172]  military schooling system in Prussia. And that's kind of where it evolved from. I think what we need to do is think about what are the, you know, what are the skills that our kids are going to need? I see too. And I can only, I don't feel like I can wrap my arms around UK's issues, but in terms of the US political extremism, I would put it number two, you know, at negative 40 Celsius and Fahrenheit meet. And because of our electoral system and Citizens United, people from the far left who are crazy and people from the 
[P173]  right who are crazy are just overrepresented. And they come together to meet on reckless spending, deficit spending. They come together to agree on anti-Semitism. And there's just too many people on the far left and the far right. And the people in the middle, it's minority rule. They're just not represented. However, I think the biggest threat that people aren't talking about, and I've actually spent some time talking with the administration around this, or the former administration, I should say, is loneliness. And that is, you have the deepest pocketed, most well-resourced 
[P174]  companies and people in the world trying to convince people, especially young men, that they can have a reasonable facsimile of life on a screen with an algorithm. And I think they literally go crazy. I think they wake up and they're obese and lonely and have no skills. We talked about this. I think young people, I say this jokingly, but seriously, I think young people need to get out of the house more, drink more, make a series of bad decisions that might pay off. I think we need more sex. I think we need more people in third spaces. 
[P175]  more church, more religious, more institutions, national service. We're mammals. And I worry that we're, one in seven men doesn't have a single friend. One in four men can't name a best friend. So this loneliness epidemic where people get into a bubble and start engaging in conspiracy theory, not trusting each other, blaming women, blaming the nation, self-harm. I just, I worry about, you know, when I say to young men, I coach a lot of young men, 
[P176]  15 minutes for a reason. This shit is hard and it's worth it. But I worry that we're raising, like I said, this new species of asocial, asexual being called the young American male that is obese, anxious, and just a shitty citizen. Constantine, the most important thing in 2025 that's not getting enough attention? In the UK and in most of Europe, it's an issue that Daniel raised earlier, which is in the UK, our energy prices are four times what they are in the United States. 
[P177]  That is an ideological decision. It's done because we're saving the planet. That's what we're being told. The reality is our contribution to global carbon emissions is we're responsible for 2% of global carbon emissions in the world. Making British pensioners freeze to death every winter because they can't afford fuel bills is not the solution to climate change. And if you amplify that further, 
[P178]  making our economy uncompetitive, making Britain unable to generate wealth for itself and for its future is not the moral position. Net zero, which is the impoverishment of our society for ideological reasons, has been positioned as the moral cause where we're saving the planet, we're ending climate change. We're not doing any of that. All we're doing is virtue signaling and making our fellow citizens suffer. So what we should be talking about is how do we make energy cheap, again, 
[P179]  so that we can have a prosperous economy. And guess what? When people are prosperous, that's when they actually start being responsible about pollution, about throwing away things they don't need. And also, when you have money, that's when you can invest money in scientific research, which allows you to find cleaner, better forms of energy. That's what we should be doing. We should be making sure that we generate as much wealth for our fellow citizens as possible, because a lot of people are struggling. 
[P180]  deeply, deeply immoral to impoverish already poor pensioners in this country and to prevent businesses from hiring people and giving them jobs and opportunities, including the young men that Scott is talking about, because we are saving the planet and we're trying to keep little Greta happy. We're not doing any of that. We're not successful in that. We should stop pretending and we should do what Donald Trump said he plans to do, which is drill baby drill. We should be exploring and exploiting all the energy reserves 
[P181]  this country in order to create clean energy and better forms of energy for the future, as well as to improve the well-being of our fellow citizens. That's what we should be talking about a hell of a lot more than we are. You need cheap energy. You're right. It's what I would argue. I think it's going to be liquid, natural gas and nuclear. We haven't talked about AI. AI requires 10 times the energy. The AI query is a Google query. The choke point is energy. I would argue in the US, I think we'd benefit more from as opposed 
[P182]  The drill, baby, drill, build, baby, build. I think young people have seen housing prices just go crazy. There's a psychological benefit to household formation, forced savings. So I'm going to take your word because you're a very smart guy that Britain has implemented a series of policies. That energy stat you rolled out was incredible. But in the U.S., like I said, I don't want to say we're drowning in oil. There were more drilling permits issued under Biden. 
[P183]  than the previous Trump admitted. I mean, just to call Biden anti-energy or that somehow we have this massively overinflated energy prices, it's just not, that hasn't happened in the US. I would like, we need more homes in the US. And in the UK too. And Stephen, let me just, before you wrap up, fill the stats out a little bit more. Obviously, everyone understands that geopolitically we're in a pretty tense time and there's conflicts happening. 
[P184]  Britain is in a position now where we would struggle. You've got to remember British history. Britain is, Britannia rules the waves, right? The way that Britain has become a great nation throughout history is by having a powerful fleet. We would struggle to build warships now because we've closed down all our steelworks because we're green, right? It's insanity. And on every other issue to do with energy and industry, we have basically deliberately moved our production 
[P185]  facilities to other countries. Okay, great idea. Globalization, make things cheaper, ship things, but wonderful. Okay, what happened during COVID? What happened when suddenly the entire chains of production weren't quite operating the way that they normally do? Oh, China's suddenly hoarding all the masks. Interesting. So what do you think is going to happen when there's a war? Or they're just going to keep shipping the steel to us to make the battleships and the warplanes that we need to fight them? That's what you think is going to happen? This whole thing, this whole agenda is ideological, 
[P186]  And what Ed Miliband is about to do to this country when it comes to this issue needs to talk about way more. And it is about economic prosperity. It is about housing, because one of the reasons we don't build as much housing as we need to is, again, building housing produces emissions. And we don't want to be not green. So that's why people in their 30s and 40s are now living in flat shares for four people. We have got to let go of this obsession with net zero. We have got to build. We have got to drill. 
[P187]  We have got to produce energy and we have got to stop thinking that the moral thing to do is to make our poor citizens suffer in order that we feel good about saving the planet, which we're not even remotely saving by doing this. Guys, thank you so much for all of your perspective. One of the things I realised as you guys were talking is that you're all fathers and you're all fathers of boys, although you're fathers of boys at different ages. So I wanted to just give you all 30 seconds if you could. 
[P188]  self for this advice but based on everything that's happening in the world which can feel incredibly confusing especially to young people where we're getting a lot of our information from different echo chambers what is the advice that you would all give to your young boys that would best prepare them for the future in the next couple of years starting with you Dan yeah so I've got a six-year-old daughter a seven-year-old son and a 
[P189]  them for a world that's fast changing is difficult. We're taking the approach of a lot of general knowledge across a lot of things so that you can use AI to run deep in different topics. We're encouraging the kids to interact with supervised AI conversations and letting them know that that technology is available. We're also just focusing on some manual skills, like how to fix a boiler and how to saw through some wood. 
[P190]  you know, those kind of things. And also we're doing things like acting classes, being up on a stage and performing. So all of those kind of typical things. But to be honest, it is a point of anxiety in my life just thinking about what, you know, what the world looks like for, you know, 10 or 15 years from now that they're going to be going into. So if you get clear answers on this, I'm really open to learning. 
[P191]  For me, my son is two and a half, so it's a little bit early for this pep talk. But my message to him when he's old enough to hear it is going to be this. Your grandfather, your great-grandfather, my grandfather, was taken as a slave laborer from Soviet Ukraine to Nazi Germany. Your great-grandfather was born, your great-grandmother, rather, was born in the Soviet Gulag. Your great-grandmother lived through the German occupation 
[P192]  Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. You are not living in the worst time ever. You're surrounded by pussies. If you are a man and if you do your job and if you learn the skills that you need to do and if you pursue the things that you want to do with your life to the best of your ability, if you believe in yourself, if you believe that you're talented, if you actually achieve the things that you set your mind to, there's never been a better time in the history of humanity than now. You're surrounded mostly by people who feel sorry for themselves, 
[P193]  If you're not one of them, you're going to clean up. Young women are looking for a young man like you who's actually going to stand up for himself, who's actually going to go out there and achieve and be confident. Be that and you're going to clean up when it comes to finding the right partner for yourself. You're going to clean up when it comes to making money. You're going to clean up when it comes to your career. You're going to clean up on every front because the bar has never been lower. The bar has never been lower. So just go out and be a man and life is going to be great. 
[P194]  I'm older. I have 14 and 17 year old boys. And my observation is you can't tell them anything. The best you can do is you can try and model behavior for them. So I'm trying to be really kind to their mother. I'm trying to show them that, you know, if you're serious about having a good family, you got to be a generous, loving partner. I'm trying to be in great physical shape, which is getting harder and harder. I'm trying to be aggressive around them in terms of business. 
[P195]  business and trying to be kind. And what I do, I do talk to them about the concept of surplus value. I'm like, you're takers right now. You know, the UK school system, which is amazing, is investing a lot in you and you're giving almost nothing back. Me and your mother are loving you a lot more than you're loving us. You're just taking resources everywhere. You're a net negative. And you're crossing the manhood isn't sex or some religious ceremony. You're crossing the manhood is when 
[P196]  you are start creating surplus value. You're loving more people than you're absorbing. You're listening to more complaints than you are complaining. You're creating more revenue than you're absorbing. That's the notion. It's surplus value. And I have this trick called what a man does. And I've been doing this when they're kids. I'm like, guests show up. A man goes and gets their luggage and puts it in their room. A man is constantly scanning the table for empty water glasses. And I mean, one of the proudest moments I ever had was when I'm like, 
[P197]  my six-year-old boy who was all like 30 pounds got up and went over this gigantic pitcher of water at this table and like started like trying to pour other people's water and everyone had no idea what was going on here. You know, I do these things called what a man does. A man goes up to, a man asks a woman out for coffee. A man pays for women. I'm a sexist that way. I still have told my men, my son gave me this rap on, oh dad, you're so establishment. I'm like, do you ever want to have sex? 
[P198]  I'm like, then you need to pay. I mean, that's the bottom line. Anyways, but what I would say is I'm trying to model. I'm trying to model good behavior or be a good role model. But I agree with Constantine and Daniel. I think every day they have more potential to lead the most amazing life in history. I'm not a nihilist. I'm not a catastrophist. I think I have big problems. But given the blessings of the sons born to these, 
[P199]  men and future you know future sons that you'll have steven jesus it's good to be them there's just they have no excuse they should they should they should rock on they should have a wonderful life constantine scott daniel thank you so much for taking the time um at sort of short notice to talk about all these subjects it's incredibly wide-ranging conversation and you'll bring such an interesting hilarious nuanced perspective to these issues i'm glad that we can have these conversations and disagree in a respectful way that hopefully clarifies a lot of the confusion that i 
[P200]  experience and a lot of people are experiencing at the moment so thank you to all of you i'm going to link to all of your work on the screen i know scott you've got a book coming on masculinity which we're all very very excited about we've been waiting it's long overdue please hurry up um constantine you've got an incredible podcast with trigonometry which i'm going to link on the screen and i suggest everybody goes and listens to and subscribes to if they're looking for more of this stuff and daniel you've just been on my show already but your endless amount of books and i think the best place to get more from you is your website of course uh your the daniel priestly website where you can find all of your books and all of your work and everything you're doing there 
[P201]  Thank you, everybody. Really, really appreciative and incredibly grateful for taking part in our first little experiment of this kind. So, yeah, thank you.

[P1] ﻿ You're listening to TIP. One key to some of the legendary investors' most significant investments was their deep understanding of a business. Whether you look at people like Warren Buffett, Leeloo, or Philip Fisher, these guys just knew how to understand a business better than nearly anybody else out there. They used this knowledge to their advantage, finding investments that were unloved or orphaned unnecessarily. Today, I will cover a wide range of people that you can talk to to understand a business 
[P2]  at an extremely high level. From my research into scuttlebutt, I found four primary parties that you want to talk to to improve your understanding of a business. I'll cover precisely who those parties are and what you should ask them to enhance your own business acumen. Now, you might be wondering, why should I add the scuttlebutt method when researching a stock? After all, isn't reading public information enough to understand the business? And to answer that, I would say, yeah, you probably can learn a lot about a company via public filings, 
[P3]  research reports, earnings calls, and earnings reports. But you will never understand a business to its full extent using these resources exclusively. If you want an edge in investing, you have to work for it. And Scuttlebutt is that edge that I think very few are willing to do, but the ones that are willing to do it can get these very, very outsized returns. This episode has some great case studies to really hammer home how important Scuttlebutt is. You'll learn how legends like Warren Buffett and Lee Liu have used Scuttlebutt to find incredible investments. 
[P4]  also review some other case studies from others that have successfully sleuthed a business and reaped some enormous benefits. And then to finish the episode off and stay with the ethos of improved learning, I wanted to weave in how you can use your circle of competence to better understand industries or business templates to either double down on or to avoid like the plague. Self-reflection and deep thinking are key to Warren Buffett's success, and I thought I'd share my framework as well for learning from my prior mistakes. If you're the type of person who enjoys introspective 
[P5]  resonate with my framework. Now, without further ado, let's get right into this week's episode. Welcome to The Investor's Podcast. I'm your host, Kyle Grieve. 
[P6]  which is Scuttlebutt, which was made famous by Philip Fisher in his wonderful book, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits. But I'm not going to go over just that book, which I did pretty recently. I'm actually going to focus on the theme of Scuttlebutt and look at a variety of really, really good resources that are going to help you become more proficient at deepening your own understanding of a business. Now, one of the most important parts of investing is gaining the conviction that the investing decisions that you make are correct. 
[P7]  conviction. Maybe you are looking at the numbers and seeing that the business is growing at a pace that you're happy with. Or perhaps the company launched a new product and you think they've executed flawlessly on that product launch. Or maybe you're tracking the returns on invested capital, or maybe their margin expansion, and you're observing that they're continuing to move in a desirable direction. Now, while there's nothing wrong with using these methods to improve your conviction, today we're going to look at an analytical method to really help improve your understanding of a business. And here's the thing, everyone has access. 
[P8]  to the information that I discussed above, right? I can log on to FinChat or Seeking Alpha and get these numbers pretty simply. But the problem is, in order to be successful with investing, you need a variant perception in order to take advantage of the markets. And learning info that is not contained in the financial statements of a business is one of the best ways, I think, that you can accomplish this. So today, we're going to be discussing, like I already mentioned, Scuttlebutt. Now, many listeners of TIP will be familiar with Scuttlebutt. It's a concept I spoke about on TIP 646. 
[P9]  For those who don't know what Scuttlebutt is, it's simply the process of learning about a business by accumulating information about that business by talking with people that are associated with the company. Now, people who are associated with the company could be a variety of people. It could be the CEO. It could be lower level employees. It could be the sales department. It could be people in research and development. It could also be customers, suppliers, and industry experts, et cetera. But let's circle back here to why Scuttlebutt is so essential. Let's say I know a retail business pretty well. 
[P10]  Let's call it ABC. Let's say I think the business is starting to get expensive. I have three pretty simple options. I can sell it, I can hold it, and I can buy more. Now, most investors will base which of these decisions they're going to make based on things like intrinsic value of the business, the evaluation of the company, its growth rates, understanding and evaluating management based on earnings calls. And that's all fine and dandy, but in the example above, I'm still making some sort of error. If I knew people intimately involved in the business and could ask them questions like, 
[P11]  at ABC during the holiday season, I might get information that is much more valuable than looking at just the information that I gave in the example here. Now, let's say I ask a lower level employee that same question, and the response is something along the lines of, work was swamped, items were flying off the shelves, and we couldn't replace them fast enough. Oh, also, we were also shown a video by management that thanked the employees for record sales in North America and e-commerce. Now, once you hear this news, you probably won't be in such a rush to sell 
[P12]  shares as it means the business is continuing to improve. This is a real case study for me. And after hearing it, I knew I'd hold my shares longer and I still do. But this is news I wouldn't have ever been able to use in my analysis if I didn't know the people in the industry or know the people who are familiar with that business. I know people like Philip Fisher would agree that Scuttlebutt is integral to the success of many great investors. So today we're going to cover legendary investors and their Scuttlebutt strategies. We're going to look at things like how Warren got a masterclass in insurance, 
[P13]  We'll look at how Lee Liu befriended a board member of Timberland to help him better understand the integrity and talent of the management team there. And I'm going to sprinkle in plenty of my own stories of scuttlebutt that I think will resonate very, very well with you. But first, a fair warning. Consider a few things first if you want to do scuttlebutt or sleuthing, which I'm going to be using interchangeably here. So first of all, it takes a lot of time. Now, I can go through a company's financial statements or official documents. It's still going to take a lot of time, right? 
[P14]  once you start understanding all the different layers of scuttlebutt that you can do, you can spend a lot of time on just one simple business. And if you want to talk to all the different parties that I'm going to be talking with today, I mean, you could easily make that into a full-time job, which some people do. So just understand that while I think this is the best way to understand a business at a very, very deep level, you're only going to be able to do so much of it. You're not going to be able to do all of it and that's okay. But I think adding little bits and pieces of what I'm going to be covering today is going to be really, really helpful. 
[P15]  So second point here is that it works really well with a concentrated portfolio. As I just alluded to here, if one business can take 40, 80, 100 hours to sleuth or to understand better, that's going to be a business that probably you want to put a lot of money behind. And it's not going to be something where you're going to want to just put 1% in. And on top of that, if you just put doing 1% positions, that means that you probably have a lot of position that if you want to do really, really deep research on a lot of positions, it's nearly impossible. 
[P16]  to do by yourself. And maybe you would need a team of other people to help you out with that. And then the last thing here is that it just requires doing a lot of work that very, very few others will do. And that's why it's so valuable. So if you're the type of person who likes going that extra mile and wants to get that just small little edge, I think this is going to be an area of your analysis that you should spend some time on improving on. And then finally here, I just want to get this out of the way. I'm not describing anything illegal like insider training. That's not what scuttlebutter sleuthing is. 
[P17]  So there was a really good book that I read in prepping for this episode called Scuttlebutt Investor. And so here's what the definition of scuttlebutt was. The origin of the term is related to sailing. Water for consumption on sailing ships was typically stored in a scuttlebutt, a butt or a cask, which had been scuttled by making a hole in it so the water could be withdrawn. Since sailors exchanged gossip when they gathered at the scuttlebutt for a drink of water, scuttlebutt became slang for gossip or rumors. 
[P18]  equivalent of water cooler talk. Now, another reason that Scuttlebutt is so important is related to a wonderful Charlie Munger quote. He said, I never disagree with someone else's opinion unless I understand their side better than they do. Now, in my opinion, Scuttlebutt will help you determine if a business would make a better short than a long. Now, I personally have never shorted a stock in my life, but I think if a company is likely to go down in price, that's probably a pretty good thing to know if I'm contemplating going long on that idea. Now, suppose you know that a business has, 
[P19]  a 90% customer concentration. And that one customer who made up 90% was just lost. In that case, that's probably really, really good evidence that the company is likely to be worth just a lot less once that news comes out and probably for a long time into the future, maybe forever into the future. Scuttlebutt can help you determine which types of events can build or destroy conviction. So there's a business that I loosely followed. It's a microcap called Avricor Health. This business just crushed it going from about $0.07 
[P20]  to 24 cents in less than a year. Then they announced a strategic shift away from pharmacies in Canada and that they would actually be going towards going international. And now the price has dropped back down to 4 cents. So hypothetically speaking, if someone could chat with the people who were sending checks or who were the actual customers of Avricor from the pharmacies that were leaving, they would have learned that that relationship had been severed or funding had been cut and they probably could have gotten out before this massive rundown and they maybe could 
[P21]  understood that this business was going to lose their customer even earlier than the market actually did. So that's the kind of information that you can get from doing Scuttlebutt. Now let's get into the meat of today's episode and talk about how we do Scuttlebutt. The way I see it, there are kind of four primary parties that we want to talk to, to understand the state of a business. The first one is going to be customers. The second one is going to be employees. Number three would be suppliers. And the fourth is specialists. So in his excellent book, which I'm going to be referring to a lot here today, which is called The Sleuth Investor, the author, Abner Mandelman, 
[P22]  added a fifth party, which he likes to look at, which is plant and periphery. Now, he made a really good case as to why this is important. And I think it is important, but we're not going to be covering that today because I want to focus more on the relationship aspect of talking with actual people. And while observing physical things is great and definitely helpful, it just isn't going to be something that I'm going to cover today because I think it would probably take too much time. So each of these four parties can be further broken down by quite a bit, and that's what we're going to spend some more time here doing right now. 
[P23]  Customers. So customers are people like end users. These are people who determine if the product should be purchased or if it should pass on for a competing product. These are the people who send the checks to the company to actually buy the product. You can look at current customers. You can look at former customers. You can look at potential customers. The next section here is employees. So employees is a place where I think a lot of people probably spend a lot of their time, although I think customers might actually be the most important. 
[P24]  But what makes up employees? So you got people like lower level employees, people working machinery, if that's what the kind of business utilizes. You got people in sales and marketing department. You got C-suites, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officers. You got people in research and development, people on the boards of directors. And then you can also look at current employees, former employees, and then also the employees of competitors of that business or in a specific industry. 
[P25]  there's kind of three main groups. You're looking at current suppliers, former suppliers, and potential suppliers. And then when you're looking at specialists, there's a whole bunch of different people you'd look at. Competitors, shareholders, other analysts, whether they're professional retail analysts, industry insiders, people who are doing the local news, and maybe even chambers of commerce. Now, let's start here with the most important people to speak to, which is customers. So I already mentioned here that I'm going to be using scuttlebutt and the word sleuthing 
[P26]  interchangeably. So sleuthing was very well covered by Abner Manelman in his book, The Sleuth Investor. So Abner writes, in investment sleuthing, you use detection and investigatory techniques to get exclusive physical information about companies in which you are considering investing. Little known facts about a company can give you a decisive edge when buying or selling that company's stock. So I just wanted to give you that definition. He talks a little bit about scuttlebutt and he, I believe, considers them to be pretty much the same thing as well. Although I will admit that in Abner's 
[P27]  book, he goes much more in-depth into sleuthing. So Abner says, and I agree, that you can learn just an inordinate amount about a business from understanding its customers at a very deep level. So he poses just four kind of questions to better understand a business by talking to its customers. So the first one is, who are the customers? The second one is, what exactly is being purchased? The third is, what is actually being sold? And the fourth is, why would the customer buy from the business in question versus a competitor? So let's break these down in a little more detail. 
[P28]  first question about who the customer is, is very, very essential. After all, it's the customers who are going to be sending checks to the company, which eventually shows up in the top line as revenue. So Abner breaks down customers into three primary categories. So the first are the end users. Let's imagine that we're looking at a software company. This would be people who use the actual software, maybe as part of their daily life or as part of their job. So these are the people who might actually use the software, 
[P29]  not actually be in charge of actually buying the software. But they might, you know, obviously like the product so much that they're going to recommend that they use a specific product to the people who actually do send the checks. So these types of people, you know, if they're using a software that they can't live without, that's obviously very, very important because it means that the people who are sending checks probably also know that. And it means that the checks are going to keep on coming in. That is a good segue here to the second customer, which are the decision makers. These are the people that might not actually physically write and send the checks, 
[P30]  but they can approve if a specific product is purchased. So these two people sometimes are the same person, sometimes aren't the same person. And then the third and final type of customer are just the people that sign and send the checks. Again, they might not actually be the end user. A very, very important distinction. So the perfect customer is when the same person does all three of these functions, but that's just not always the case. I sleuthed this exact question on a business that sells software to petroleum engineers, 
[P31]  someone who was a customer of the business and used the product. So if I look at it in the framework used above, the person I spoke to fulfilled probably the first and second functions of the customers. So they got to be the end user and they got to tell someone to basically send the check so that they could continue using it. But they didn't actually send the check themselves. Now, from what I learned about chatting with this person, it was pretty easy for them to get the software if they needed it. Luckily, the software is in kind of a duopoly. So the options are very limited. 
[P32]  got A or B. Now, the reason it's so important to understand these three customer categories is because there can be a specific relationship where a business isn't necessarily selling its product to the right person. So Abner has a really, really good example in his book where he discussed this fictitious company called Alpaca Systems. So this business sold customer relation management CRM software to retail stock brokers. So let's use just Abner's framework in this case study. So who are the customers? So the customers were the retail broker's manager, 
[P33]  and the retail brokers. Second question, what exactly is each customer buying? The manager was actually buying control of the brokers and the brokers were getting help with improving their productivity. But as a result of using this software, they're actually losing control over their own clients. So the third question here is what exactly is Alpaca selling? So Admir initially thought that it was productivity tools, which it really was, but it was also control over the brokers. And Alpaca, the business, 
[P34]  didn't actually realize this at the time. So the fourth question is, why would the customer buy it? And so if you look at the broker's managers, they bought it because the software worked. And if the broker's produced at a high level, they got higher bonuses. Additionally, it gave the firm even more control over the broker's clients because they knew more about every one of their clients. But there was a problem here. And that was that if a broker wanted to switch firms, they often needed control of their own clients. If they wanted to switch firms and weren't going to bring any clients over, 
[P35]  valuable to the new firm. And unfortunately, the Alpaca system didn't allow this. So even if the brokers were using the Alpaca system, they actually weren't using it to its full capabilities. They were doing things like keeping paper records and keeping copies of their customer's info at home. That way, that gave them more control over their clients if they wanted to eventually leave their former company. So Abner wrote, while Alpaca thought it was only selling higher productivity to its product users, it was also unknowingly helping its users' employers enslave them. 
[P36]  one of the best examples I can give of a strategic mistake. And it is one I would likely never have grasped if I had not talked to the final product users directly. Certainly, no brokerage analyst would dare to write up the above in a research report. Now, once Abner learned about this part of the business, he kind of stopped sleuthing it at a deep level and he loosely followed it. But fast forward a little bit and he actually observed that Alpaca eventually did something quite brilliant. They actually fired their customers who are the broker's managers. And instead of selling to the broker's managers, 
[P37]  sold directly to the brokers themselves. So they geared the software to the specific brokers and they targeted just the highest earners. This allowed the brokers to improve productivity by using the software while allowing them to keep control over their own clients. So if they wanted to leave, the software would still work with them even if they left to go to a different firm. Now, this is the type of information that is readily available to anyone who's willing to go and look for it, but very few people do this kind of work. 
[P38]  in a business's financial document and use things like Google or ChatGPT to get questions answered. Now, while this is better than doing nothing, it won't give you the type of informational advantage because anybody with a computer and an internet connection can have the same access as you. Let's look at another just classic example of scuttlebutt that Warren Buffett did a few decades ago. This concerned a business most listeners are going to be familiar with, American Express. Warren had owned American Express stock more than once, 
[P39]  time. So it's part of his business analysis. So we're going to go over the first time here. And this was during the salad oil scandal. So my colleague, Clay, actually just went over that in some detail on TIP682, which I'll get linked up here. So I won't go into too much depth into it. But I will say that essentially what happened was that the market assumed the salad oil scandal would be really bad for the business of American Express. But Warren, he could have just read what was written in the paper, read what all other investors were reading, and concluded the same thing. 
[P40]  Outside of it, he did his own scuttlebutt and realized that the scandal that was going on didn't actually affect American Express's business. So let's go over that in some more detail. Since he could tell their financial health was okay from reading public documents, he then tasked himself with finding out about the customers of American Express and if they were behaving any differently than from before the scandal had happened. He had a very simple way of doing this. He just simply went to places that accepted American Express and he hung around the cash register. 
[P41]  were still using the American Express card, and he asked if the customer behavior had changed at all. Once he deemed that their behavior had not changed, he knew that American Express was an opportunity that was lying in the open for him to take advantage of, which he did to quite a high degree of success. Now, I'll reiterate here that scuttlebutt he did could not be gleaned from public information. If something like this happened today, it wouldn't be that hard to reach out to a family member or friends or colleagues that had an American Express card and ask them if they're still using one. I know I own one personally. If something like this happened today, 
[P42]  I would continue using my Amex card as long as vendors accepted it and as long as I got my bonuses points. Let's take a quick break and hear from today's sponsors. 
[P43]  may be, and then answer your question. The best part is that every portion of the answer is cited with the source document.

[P47]  Thank you. 
[P48]  ta.com slash billionaires. All right, back to the show. 
[P49]  is they're going to give you unique insights that current customers might not provide because they probably don't have a filter and maybe they're not in love with that product compared to current customers. So they can give you different perspectives. So from potential customers, you can just learn things like why they're doing business with the business competitor. That alone is a really, really good question to ask because chances are they might've actually tried the product of the business that you're looking at and they're going to be able to compare that to different competitors' products 
[P50]  why they think one product is better than another. And sometimes you might find that the business that you're looking at has an inferior product. And that's a very, very important thing to know. Essentially, what you're trying to do is find out why they aren't a customer. And that alone can really, really help you illuminate any of the business's weaknesses that it might have. So former customers can tell you a lot of things. They can tell you why they stopped paying the business in question. They can tell you what's better or worse with the new business that they're working with. 
[P51]  costs that were involved from using one product to switching to another product. And the thing that's really good about former customers is just the amount of honesty that you're probably going to get. They're probably going to think maybe about that business and not so bright of a light, which could obviously bias them in other directions. But I think it's just a good way to get a variety of different perspectives and really, really get to the truth of why a company's products are better or worse than its competitors, or maybe they're all the same. You never know. 
[P52]  I think that this information is really useful because it can really help you identify potential red flags that you might not be able to identify in any other way. Now let's move on to what you can learn from a business as employees. This includes people from factory workers all the way up to the CEO. These are going to be people like low-level employees, people involved in marketing the business or selling products to customers, executives of a variety of different executives, research and development, board of directors, current employees, former employees, and even competitors. 
[P53]  employees. One of the cool things you can do when you're first starting this is just make a list, try to find current and former employees. Former employees is a little bit harder to figure out. I personally haven't really figured that out yet, but for current employees, you want things like names, find out their connections to people inside of the business or outside of the business, and just get as much detail as you can on people. For lower level employees, it can be a little bit harder to find them as they're not necessarily featured on a business's website. If you look at the proxy statement or 
[P54]  a circular of a business, they're going to tell you quite clearly who are management, who are the board directors. So those names are easy to come across. But if you are looking for lower level employees, sometimes if you go to a company's website, you can see if they have an about me section. And sometimes the about me section will actually talk about lower level employees, maybe have some quotes. And these quotes are usually, I don't even know if these quotes are actually from the employees, but sometimes they share their name. So an easy way to find out these employees is put their name into 
[P55]  or put their name into LinkedIn. And that's the way that I personally have found a ton of employees. And then even if you can't find the names of employees, LinkedIn is still super helpful. So if you use the search function on LinkedIn, there's actually quite a bit of information you can find. So you can go on LinkedIn, use the search function, look at the name of the company that you're looking for. Then you go to the people tab and basically all the company's employees who are on LinkedIn who list that business as their employer will be on there. Then you can try to reach out to them on LinkedIn. 
[P56]  Now, I'll be honest with you, from my experience, this is more of a volume game. I think with LinkedIn, a lot of people use LinkedIn for jobs. So if they already have a job, they're not necessarily going to be on there probably very often. Some people are, some people aren't. And so, like I said, volume game, you got to just try to connect with people, shoot them a DM. And there's probably a good chance a lot of people won't answer you. And that's okay. That's just kind of part of the scuttlebutt process. But there are enough people that will answer you that I think it's worth it. So Philip Fisher had some great strategies. 
[P57]  for Scuttlebutt when it came specifically to this segment here about employees. So when Philip sought answers to questions about what you should look for in investment with a lot of potential, he wrote, 
[P58]  functions form a worthwhile conclusion as to whether the particular company has outstanding potentialities for growth and development. Now, the problem is that getting information from key personnel can be quite difficult because oftentimes these people are very, very successful. And part of that success means that they're probably working a lot. And they also work for very, very successful companies, which have very high expectations. So a lot of times they're not necessarily going to be too eager to just talk to some stranger about their job. 
[P59]  Some of these people, for instance, in research and development, they're probably not going to be too interested in sharing the stuff that they're working on if there's people from competitors that are listening in or whatever, or maybe some of them even have non-disclosure agreements where they can't talk about it. But nonetheless, Phil liked to look at people in things like the research and development departments as well as salespeople. He wanted to know specifically to do with salespeople if the business had the right people inside of it to continue growing. 
[P60]  the heads of departments, but also just from lower level people in sales as well. So things that I like to find out from salespeople are, you know, just ask them how things are going. Are they enjoying their job? Are they disliking their job? Are they busy? You know, do they have a lot of time on their hands or are they swamped? Obviously, you know, that can help you understand more. If someone goes from being not so busy to super busy, well, maybe there's something interesting going on in that business. You might find out how they're incentivized. Incentivization systems are easy to find on public documentations for management, 
[P61]  not necessarily for employees. So I'm not going to tell you to go and ask how much money someone makes, but if you just ask them how they're incentivized, is it based off of a commission or whatever, that's important information. And if you develop some sort of relationship, I think you can probably get that kind of information. Other things that are really interesting to get is their thoughts on management. Do they like management or do they dislike management? I think that's pretty interesting to know. And if everyone dislikes management, well, that's probably a pretty big red flag. 
[P62]  business. If you talk to a bunch of people and they're all seemingly pretty down on the business, well, that's an interesting sign. And also on the other side, if everyone's very, very happy about the business and giddy and excited, well, that's another really, really good sign as well. And then if you're talking to people about their job and you find out that maybe a bunch of their colleagues got fired and aren't being replaced by new people, I mean, that alone is a really good signal that maybe the business is very unlikely to increase its sales anytime soon. 
[P63]  lot of emphasis on was research and development. He knew that a business that had the potential to be worth multiples of what it was today needed an R&D department that could continue to push the company to create new, innovative, and excellent products that also had the right salespeople in place to go out and actually sell that product to the market. So I think you can kind of lump these two areas together to some degree. So there's this trust manufacturer that I own, and it's in the beginning stages of utilizing automation to increase its output by nearly doubling it in a very short period of time, 
[P64]  the automation equipment's completely installed. I've had the chance to speak with management multiple times and done my best to learn more about who supplies their technology and how it's going to work once it's fully installed and operational. Now, one of the main problems this business will eventually face is that they will be able to double their capacity. Now, on the face of things, this is obviously great. A company that can double capacity with minimal incremental expenses is a very good thing. Still, there's another potential area that must be addressed for this whole process to be successful, and that is that they have to have the sales 
[P65]  people to go out and sell that additional capacity to the market. So I got a chance to reach out to a salesperson in that business. And so I asked them a few things to understand things like how the process is going with sales. I want to know, are they busy? Get a read of how things are going so that I can hopefully be directionally correct. Are they happy with the process? Are they unhappy, lukewarm? I want to know things like, are they adding you salespeople to the team? If they're adding, that's generally a good sign that hopefully there's additional demand 
[P66]  for their product or that they're able to find additional customers to try and send people out to sell to. Another question would be, how is the automation equipment going to impact their customers? Are their customers going to get cost savings, improve service, and things like that? So if you have the ability to chat with current employees, a few things that you should try to learn, gauge their temperature on the company, find out if they're overworked or underworked, find out how promotions are handed out. Are they happy with them? Are they unhappy with them? Find out how they're incentivized. 
[P67]  and which KPIs they're incentivized on. Find out what they think of management. Find out if employees are being brought into the business, who are they being brought in from? Is your company sealing employees from maybe competitors? Is it a specific competitor? And then on the other hand, if employees are exiting, you should try and find out where they're getting their job. Are they going to a specific competitor? These are all interesting points to improve your decision-making. So in the sleuth investor, Admir says one of his favorite tools for learning information 
[P68]  just having beers with employees. Now, this is a method that I haven't had the time to try out yet, but I can see how valuable it would be. If you can speak with employees when they're in more of a casual setting, you're likely to get better information than if you maybe just go to the IR office of a business that's in your local neighborhood and they're just showing you around the workplace. In that scenario, you might just get people that are going to be on their best behavior, even if maybe they don't necessarily 
[P69]  and make the optics look good. But in an informal setting, you may get people to open up more. But like I said, I do realize this is a lot of work, which is why I still haven't gotten around to trying it myself. A few other people who are worth chatting with are members of the board of directors. Although they have to be very, very cautious about what they say, this is probably good. You don't want them getting in trouble, giving insider information, but they can still be pretty good sources of information. A few things that you can learn from them would be, 
[P70]  to the company? Are they actually doing something to provide value to that board? Or are they just there to pump up the CEO and agree with everything that he says? You may want to find out how they came about that board seat. Was it because they went to college with the CEO or someone else on the board or maybe another executive? Or was it because they've been in the industry for 30 years and they've done incredibly well with other businesses? You should look at the track record of board members. Do they have a long track record of success or 
[P71]  failure with some of the other businesses that maybe they've either managed or been a board member of. And then another one here that I think is really important is what are they doing for income? Is this board seat their primary source of income? Because if they're only getting income from being on boards of a few companies, that's very important because that means that they're probably not going to go out of their way to make things difficult if they see that things aren't being managed properly. 
[P72]  is not the CEO. But if you have someone who really needs to keep their board seat, chances are they're more likely to be leaning towards agreeing with the CEO to not make their job get into any jeopardy. So another great lesson that I've learned from talking with employees was one of Buffett's most famous investments, which was Geico. So Buffett learned about Geico when he was still a student of Benjamin Graham's at Columbia University. So he was in the library one day and he realized that Benjamin Graham, 
[P73]  was the chairman of GEICO. So I think this was just like a week later, he ended up making the trek to Washington on a weekend. And he got to the GEICO HQ, but was disappointed to learn that the doors were locked, that the location was closed for business. Luckily, there was a janitor who was working in there and let Buffett in. And so the janitor brought Warren to Lorimer Davidson, and who was the only person who was working in that day. And he actually spent four hours answering just endless questions from a young and curious Warren Buffett about 
[P74]  Geico, and just the insurance business in general. Warren said this one event changed his life. Now, this story has many interesting implications. It shows that you need the drive to go and do things that 99.99% of investors just won't do, like travel on a weekend to a company's headquarters. You need to be curious about the business and come prepared with questions to show people that you really understand them to some degree. And you also need a bit of luck. If the janitor was on a break or didn't want to be bothered, he may never have let 
[P75]  passed on that business if he didn't have the drive to go and give the headquarters another visit. Now let's transition here and discuss another critical area of a business's operations, which is its suppliers. This is an area that Philip Fisher didn't spend too much time on in common stocks and on common profits. So we're going to look at two other books, The Sleuth Investor and Scuttlebutt Investor for some ideas on why and how we should look at suppliers to kind of better understand that relationship between a company and its suppliers. 
[P76]  where Monish Pabrai was discussing win-win business relationships. Part of the reason for Charlie's love affair with Costco was that the business was in this win-win relationship. Suppliers won, just like shareholders and customers. This is a pretty rare relationship to find. That's not to say that you must have these types of relationships to find successful investments, but it doesn't hurt to find out more about the relationship that a company has with its suppliers. So here's what Monish said about win-lose relationships between a business and its suppliers. 
[P77]  which you could call win-lose. For example, there's a company that stretches out the payments they have to make to their suppliers. Maybe they take 60 or 90 days to pay their suppliers and they use the float to improve their financials. Well, that works well for the company, but not so well for the suppliers. So that's kind of an example of a win-lose business. Now, businesses can still succeed with these win-lose relationships. But like I said before, it's important to understand this relationship in a little more detail. 
[P78]  to improve your decision-making. In The Sleuth Investor, Abner points out that you can go to the supply chain to understand the volumes and the prices of what's being supplied and what kind of volume a supplier is offering a business. Another strategy Abner likes is getting to understand potential suppliers. If a company could be boosted by having close relationships with better suppliers, they could see a significant boost in their value. Abner has a bunch of strategies that take a lot of work, but can be highly valuable to anyone who wants to put the effort in. Now, one great story from Abner's book was about 
[P79]  a sleuth he met, who he called Michelle. Michelle had a PhD in mathematical finance, and she was hired by a Canadian subsidiary of this US bank that had started an index fund. She told Admir that she'd made about $90,000 in the market in a very, very quick period of time using some of the interesting sleuthing techniques that she was lucky to be exposed to. Let's get into some of the details of how Michelle sleuthed and made this windfall. So across from Michelle's desk was the office of an investment bank, which Admir refers to as the bank of industry. Now, there are only two primary outcomes that would happen. 
[P80]  Either the debt would be restructured, which was very good for the company and the stock price, or the bankers would force the company to pay, which tended to be unfavorable for the business and its stock price. So it's easy to understand why. If a business has its interest payments cut, that means its pre-tax income goes up and earnings will probably show a bump. If a company must pay increased interest expense, pre-tax income decreases and earnings will suffer. So Michelle had observed that there was an ad agency that she watched where the business borrowed about $10 million from this bank. 
[P81]  And unfortunately, what happened was the company lost a key customer. Now, the bank of industry, in order to recoup its debt, wanted the business to slash costs, basically fire people in order to raise money to service the debt. But the businesses, executives, and key personnel threatened to quit en masse if the business started doing this. Now, this was a horrible proposition to the bank because for this business, employees and executives were not easily replaceable. 
[P82]  likely be next to useless. So the bank relented, and once the debt was restructured, the share price increased by 50% in a very, very short period of time. Now, knowing this case study, Michelle dreamt of being a fly on the wall in one of these meetings. Now, obviously, there was no way for her to arrange this and taking advantage of it would be illegal anyway, but there were other ways for her to sleuth legally, which she ended up doing. So she was just a keen observer of people, and most of the time, the bankers were very cool, calm, and collected, while the business executives who were coming in to talk 
[P83]  their bankers were more nervous when they were walking in, while the business's executives were nervous walking in. But on one occasion, she observed the complete opposite. The executives looked calm entering the office while the bankers actually looked nervous. After the meeting had ended, she observed the nature of the bankers and the executives. And once again, the bankers looked ejected while the executives were high-fiving each other as they left the building. Now, during this process, she really wanted to know who this company was. And so she just looked at them and tried to find a logo or something 
[P84]  who they were and ended up seeing a logo on one of the shirts of one of the people that had been part of the meeting who worked for the business. So after that, she looked at their annual report and found the names and pictures of the executives, which she then used to verify their identity. It was indeed the company. Abner refers to it here as Filmex. It was similar to the ad agency case study I spoke about where cost cutting wasn't in the cards. So given the behavior of the bankers and the executives, it was quite clear to Michelle that the executives had just gotten a win in terms of their financial health. 
[P85]  buying shares and made about $90,000 over two days after the news of the restructuring had been announced to the public. Now here's an excellent summary of the experience. Michelle was not an employee of the bank of industry nor an employee of Filmex, not of their lawyers or accountants or anyone else defined by law as the company's insider. She had not bribed anyone nor stolen any information. She had merely observed some physical events that took place off of Filmex's premises in a public hallway. Yet she could say with an extremely high certainty that the business 
[P86]  industry was about to cut Filmex's debt and that Filmex's stock would in all likelihood soar as a result. Now, as the story of what illustrates, a business's supplier doesn't have to be the supplier in the traditional sense. It could be bankers as well. It's up to you to kind of think outside the box and use your opportunity set and skillset to find ways of observing things that are happening around you and things that you can use to your own advantage.

If you happen to find current suppliers, there's a few things that you're going to want to find out. And these are things like, how big of a customer is the company for the supplier? If the supplier is the only supplier of a particular material to the company in question, how easy it would be for a company to find an alternative supplier. 
[P94]  an idea of what the supplier thinks of the company that they supply to. Do they like them or do they speak about them in negative terms? A few themes here that you want to dig into is just how critical a supplier is to your business. If your business can't run without one supplier, that information is very, very key. If something were to happen to that supplier, then your business would essentially be done if the supplier could no longer supply the business. This is why having a business with multiple suppliers is good and a good thing to know. It protects you if something goes wrong with one supplier. 
[P95]  It's good to have another couple of suppliers on hand that you can use just in case something like that happens. Additionally, it also allows the business to negotiate rates between suppliers to find the best possible deal for the company. Also, if a supplier is the sole supplier of a key piece to many different businesses, you might run into just a great investing opportunity. There might be one supplier who's key to a whole bunch of different companies that require it for their business to run. ASML, I think, is a really good example here. 
[P96]  by no means a semiconductor specialist, but I know that that business supplies many semiconductor businesses, the machinery that's needed to manufacture their widgets. And for that reason, ASML has made an exceptional investment, compounding at 26% per annum over the last decade. Now, just like former employees, speaking with former suppliers can be a great source of information, as you're likely to get to the truth quickly. It also helps identify any potential weaknesses a business might have. You should probe into why the business relationship was severed, what the former supplier thinks of management, 
[P97]  the history of payments, whether they were on time or late, negotiating leverage between the supplier and the company, etc. If you find out the supplier left because it was constantly being squeezed by the business, that's a red flag. And that might signal that there's other suppliers that may end up doing the same thing in the future. Now, let's look at specialists or people who aren't intimately involved in a business sense, but can be invaluable in learning more about the business. They're often very willing to chat and share their knowledge. The most important people to talk to in this segment, I think, are the business's competitors. 
[P98]  Let's say you speak with five businesses that are competing with the business that you're researching, and they all identify the business that you're looking at as the business that they fear the most. In that case, that's a very, very good indicator that you've identified the leader in that industry or niche. If, on the other hand, all your scuttlebutt identifies a different business as the one that scares everyone else the most, well, maybe that means you're looking at the wrong business. Now, here's some questions that you can ask to understand competitors and their dynamics concerning the business that you're doing scuttlebutt on. Which competitors scare you the most? 
[P99]  and why? Which competitors scare you the least and why? Who are your suppliers? What are the biggest hurdles to success in the industry today? And what are you doing to overcome them? Are you hiring employees or firing employees? And if the competition is firing employees, who are they going to? And if they're hiring new ones, where are they coming from? Now, arguably the lowest hanging fruit in the specialist category are analysts themselves. You can often get your hands on analyst reports. Buffett has famously said that he doesn't rely on other analysts to 
[P100]  do his decision making for him. And I completely agree with that. But if you find other thoughtful analysts, they might know things you don't. They can help guide or connect you with maybe people worth learning more from. Or they can just offer their opinion, which might be highly valuable on specific matters in the business that maybe you're just a little unfamiliar with. Now, usually when reading an analyst report, I enjoy learning about their particular perspective. They might have looked at a business differently than I have. And knowing this can be helpful in the scuttlebutt process. 
[P101]  that they are researching the business, they are more likely to contact you if you have further questions. But at the end of the day, Buffett is correct and you should never rent conviction from others on an idea. If you do this, you will lose money or you're going to make egregious mistakes during downturns. Now, similar to analysts are shareholders who are a very good source of information. Some of them might have already done a ton of scuttlebutt themselves and can help share information with you or guide you in the right direction. I can't tell you how vital this can be, especially when you're first learning about a new business 
[P102]  on. It can be hard to understand what makes a company fire on all cylinders when you first start researching it. However, current shareholders will have their hypothesis that they will share with you. So you can just go out and see if their hypothesis is correct or not and make your own. A few other areas I like looking at are industry insiders. You can find these people easily through Google. If you're researching a well-known company, you can often find news articles about it. And these articles themselves can be helpful on their own, but it's actually the list of the people that are referenced in articles that I personally find most 
[P103]  interesting. You can see who was quoted and you can reach out to them as well as the original author and see what kind of information you can get. There's a small cap that I'm looking at right now. And I found an interesting article on bankruptcy in Canada. This has led me to contact the author and some of the bankruptcy lawyers in the industry that were mentioned in his article. I've been lucky enough to connect with the author who provided me with some very, very interesting information as well as some other resources. And from looking at some of the people he quoted in his article, I actually landed a call with the lawyer who specializes in that 
[P104]  Now, one of my favorite high-profile scuttlebutt techniques is from Leeloo, who my co-host, Clay, spoke about in depth on TIP 636. Leeloo gave an excellent case study about the importance of acting like a journalist when looking at a stock. One quote stuck out to me from his presentation, which was, you got to have a very active, very curious mind, and you can't be satisfied with bogus answers. He added, 
[P105]  go audit and leaves a trail of evidence of what kind of person they are and what they have done, how they deal with different situations. Leeloo mentions that as part of his scuttlebutt into Timberland, he went and spent a few weeks in the neighborhood where the family who owned the business lived. He mentioned things like going to their church and talking with their friends, their colleagues, and their neighbors. He would also ask what the manager did for the community and what people thought of him. He also mentions trying to learn about family dynamics, educational history, and their history in philanthropy. 
[P106]  that the son of the CEO was on a board and Leeloo managed to actually get on that board. He eventually became friends with the son and with that relationship, understood the business at an even deeper level. I love this story because it's proof that the further down the rabbit hole that you go, the better the picture of reality that you'll get. But I also have to admit that doing this is nearly impossible for the average person who can't spend weeks away from their job and may not have the means or even the inclination to put themselves up for weeks at a time. 
[P107]  In theory, it's great. You will 100% learn a lot about a person doing this. But in reality, I'm not sure even the top hedge fund managers worldwide are going to employ the strategy if they're managing billions of dollars. Maybe they could get someone like an analyst to get their boots on the ground and learn more about the managers that way. Now, with this thought, I want to move on to discuss some of the ways that you can use this information on Scuttlebutt to make better decisions without necessarily having to leave your home for weeks at a time and spending thousands of dollars on travel costs. 
[P108]  For those who can, well, congrats, but I think you're probably in the minority. I think what it really comes down to is building relationships. Someone like Warren Buffett has just a massive network of people who really, truly want to help him. And I think these are people that he could get some very high quality information just by picking up the phone and asking if they know someone in an industry or someone who maybe used to work in an industry that he's trying to learn more about. Now, I won't say that anybody can build as extensive a network as Warren Buffett. 
[P109]  I know I can't, but I think I can guarantee that you can connect with some very, very fascinating people if you put yourself out there and meet people, send emails to management or investor relations, and socialize with people on things like Twitter and LinkedIn. I wrote something up on Twitter about the trust manufacturer and had a follower of mine or reader of that tweet tell me that he used their product before as a customer. That opened up a wonderful conversation, direct messages, where I used some of the questions I listed earlier in the episode to learn more about why they went with that company and his thoughts on his 
[P110]  experience working with them. So even if you don't want to go full sleuth, I think many great points are here to help you get an informational advantage. Bill Miller says there's three advantages that investors can get, which is analytical, informational, and psychological. While I agree with Bill that the psychological edge is probably the easiest to get, but might be the hardest to portray in reality, anybody can get an informational edge if they're willing to speak to the right people and learn more about a business. Most investors base 100% of their decision 
[P111]  on accessible information, things like annual reports, quarterly reports, earnings releases, the Q&As, use items, and quantitative information that you can get on the internet. Now, like I've already kind of drilled this into, I hope, by now, the problem is that everyone has access to this information. So it's really hard to actually get a variant perception. But if you talk to the right people around a business, you can get information that maybe these massive investors or billion-dollar hedge fund managers don't have access to or aren't willing to put the work in to 
[P112]  get access to. And this is the kind of information that can keep you invested in a company when maybe hedge funds are dumping it. If you know the long-term fundamentals of the business are still in great shape, but investors are dumping due to maybe some short-term headwind, you can take advantage of this by buying more shares. But this exact scenario depends on your conviction about an idea. And finding hard to find physical information will be one underutilized way to build conviction that very few will try and find. 
[P113]  just a few ideas which can help propel you for many, many years. Now that you have a good idea of how to do scuttlebutt on a business, I want to share some interesting findings about how to continue improving your circle of competence. I think scuttlebutt and circle of competence are very closely related. Warren and Charlie have discussed at length how to understand the boundaries of your circle of competence, but there is an area I don't believe they've mentioned enough that I think has been integral to their improvement, but also my own improvement as an investor, as well as other investors that we've had on the show, such as John Huber. 
[P114]  And this is how to utilize journaling and self-reflection to become a better investor. Warren and Charlie have primarily stayed away from using words like journaling, meditation, or self-reflection, but I can only assume that during their thinking time, they're probably doing a lot of self-reflection. They're also so intelligent that they don't necessarily need to record their thoughts in a journal. However, for an average person like myself, it helps a lot to record some of my thoughts and experiences in a journal so that I can more easily reflect on them in the future. 
[P115]  from a wonderful interview the folks from Journalitic did with John Huber. In that chat, John said that one of the most significant use cases of his journaling was going back and looking at his mistakes. Since watching this, I've tried to journal more about my mistakes and get to the essence of why I made these mistakes. This alone has been very, very powerful for helping me improve. But there's another area of improvement that relates directly to the circle of competence. God and Bay had a great definition of what the circle of competence is. When you are unsure and doubtful about what you want to do, 
[P116]  do not do it. That's it. Now, the way that I've weaved this into my journaling is to look at some of my previous failures, which identify what I'm maybe unsure or doubtful about. Now, one of the failures that I've been reflecting on is probably going to go against the grain for many of the value investors that listen to this show. Many value investors like investments whose value comes from a business's assets. For instance, you might buy a company where the assets of a business are worth $2 billion while the company is only trading for a billion or $500 million. I've looked at a few of my previous investments and determined that I have 
[P117]  either made very little or lost money whenever I attempt to do this exact same thing. So from this, I can gain a new insight into where my circle of competence is strong or weak. And since my track record in this area is not good, I can assume that I'm weak. Reflecting on this, I found that a new principle was established. And so here's how I have it written in my journal. When looking at a business that is attractive primarily because it's valued below some of the parts, do not bother with the business. Instead, focus on the business from a future earnings power perspective. 
[P118]  can be seen as downside protection, but not as a reason to purchase. I think NRP is a good example of this, where I care mostly about earnings power, but the assets provide a decent floor if something were to happen to the earnings stream. Now, this is a principle that I've naturally gravitated towards over the last few years, but I think it's been worth reflecting on to ensure that I'm not making, hopefully, money-losing decisions in the future. Another interesting lesson here is to track your decision-making as often as possible. You want data points that you can use in the future to help you understand 
[P119]  where your strengths and weaknesses lie. An app that I'd highly recommend is Journalitic, which offers you just a ton of data for free. They're also very eager to improve their platform to make it more and more valuable for its users. On a recent trip to New York, I was chatting about predictions with members of the Richer, Wiser, Happier Masterclass at a dinner. Part of Journalitic allows you to make predictions with an established due date. Humorously, I made a prediction back in September of 2024, and that was that the share price of Dino Polska was unlikely to move due to a lack of new store openings. 
[P120]  So I was alerted by the app at the end of 2024, about three months later. And when I checked the share price, I realized that it already appreciated by about 33%. So we all had a good laugh. But really, this tells me a few things. A, I stink at making predictions. B, at least being wrong resulted in making money, which is great because I think it's usually the opposite way. And C, I should probably not bother making predictions in the future. Or if I do, I should heavily reduce the certainty that I'm going to be correct. Now, not only can journaling help you avoid mistakes, 
[P121]  it also illuminates your strengths. And if you continue investing in what you're strongest at, you tilt the odds in your favor that you will continue making these successful investments. If you can continue doubling down on your strengths while avoiding weaknesses, you should have a lot more success in investing. If you journal or even think deeply about mistakes, you're going to gain pretty significant insights into what you are doing that works and doesn't work. Additionally, you'll be able to save even more time as you learn what new ideas can go into the too hard pile at a much quicker pace. 
[P122]  Or if you identify a weakness in your thinking, if you have time to learn more, now you know certain areas you can learn about to maybe turn a weakness into a strength. To finish today's episode, I just want to go over five of my biggest takeaways that I think listeners can hopefully utilize to improve their scuttlebutt and decision making. So when discussing customers here, learning for customers is just crucial to learning about a business. You can take the Peter Lynch approach and research businesses that you're already a customer of. Lynch gave the example of going to the shopping mall and learning more about a business that way. You could talk with family. 
[P123]  friends, colleagues, to see which products they can't live without. You will understand the product and what makes it great if you are the customer. You will know why you use it versus the competitor. You'll appreciate the switching costs involved with using a different product. You'll know if the product keeps you as a captive customer and if you are annoyed or happy to pay more over time. For instance, I see the price of streaming services continue to increase while I think the service isn't getting any better. Amazon hasn't really increased prices, but now it shows ads every time I watch it. Netflix, 
[P124]  continues raising its ad-free prices or allows users to go with ads, but at a reduced price. And Disney seems to be just increasing its prices, but not showing hats. So I know personally that I like Netflix's library the most and the pain from having to pay more hasn't forced me to cancel yet. But if you think in this light about the product of a business you're researching, you're going to learn some very valuable information. The second point here is just on sleuthing employees. So if you're talking with a CEO and they say that part of the reason 
[P125]  business has had so much success is because of the culture. You're only going to really know this if you start talking with people that are intimately involved with the business. A CEO can, of course, say a culture is good. And then when you talk to people, find out that the culture is horrible or there is no culture. And that's very important information because culture is very, very important, especially if you're a long-term investor. And the only way that you're going to find this out is from talking with employees, or you're going to find out when it's too late and the share prices is probably going to go down on you. 
[P126]  learn a lot about actual management from talking with employees. They can help you understand if a management is well-liked and effective. If everyone dislikes management, that's a pretty red flag. And that means that you should probably find out why. And if maybe there's a suitable replacement who might be even better than the current management. Another good thing about talking with employees is getting an update on the business. I luckily know a few CEOs of companies that I own, and they've been invaluable to me when I have questions to ask or want an update, or maybe there's a gray area that I want to understand better. If you go to events where CEOs go, 
[P127]  trade shows or something like that. I don't think it's too tough to establish some rapport with them where they're more likely to answer your questions in the future. So a third one here on suppliers, for me personally, I'm a long-term investor. So sleuthing for events that are only going to make a difference to the share price for a quarter or two, or even a couple of days, it just doesn't interest me very much. So the part about suppliers that interests me the most is finding out how they're involved in a business supply chain I'm looking at. 
[P128]  with a company and wants to keep their business and has great relationships, that's very, very valuable. And it shows that hopefully this business will continue being supplied by their suppliers for a long period of time. For any investor, whether you're looking at a manufacturer or a tech business, there's usually a supplier angle. And I think learning more about that relationship can be very helpful in learning more about how just the business works. The other interesting part about suppliers is that finding out who they are can be pretty difficult at times. Some public companies might say explicitly in their documentation, but I think some of them also like to keep it a secret. 
[P129]  so as to not tip off any competition. Now, if that's the case, if they don't want to talk about it openly, it definitely requires some more work and innovation to find out who the suppliers are. You might have to reach out to management or employees to find out if they'll share it with you, or you can look at other competitors or industry insiders and try to get to suppliers that way. So the fourth area here is just talking to specialists. I love talking with specialists. I think it's a great source, 
[P130]  If you speak to someone who owns a stock, you're likely to hear very cheery news from other bulls about that company. In this sense, talking to someone who's short can actually be more helpful. You'll learn why they think the business will likely decrease in value or price, and then it's up to you to analyze if their evidence is more compelling than the evidence for the bulls. If it's more convincing than your current beliefs, you know that maybe you don't need to continue researching a stock, or maybe if you own it, then maybe you should sell it. 
[P131]  here. We talk about this a lot. I talk about this a lot. Everyone has biases and it can be very helpful to determine what that bias is before you talk to a specialist on a business. Because if you talk to someone and it's their biggest position, it's very likely that they're going to be thinking quite highly of it. So just understand that if you can find specialists that maybe have no vested interest in the business, that can be helpful because they don't have a financial bias. And hopefully that means that maybe some of the information you might get 
[P132]  be not distorted. So the last one here is about my framework for learning from mistakes. I wanted to just quickly discuss a general framework that I've used for learning from my own investing mistakes that I think will be very, very helpful. So I have kind of this four-step process, and I'll expand the example that I just used a few minutes ago here. So the first one is looking where your most significant losses are. So for me, I also look at businesses where perhaps the investment didn't lose money, but my thought process, 
[P133]  ended up being kind of wrong. So a good example of that is heritage growth properties where I made money on the investment, but I didn't see it as a successful investment because the thesis just didn't really play out as I thought. So the second part here is identify similar thought patterns. Some of my least successful investments have been when the primary driver of the investment, like I just said, was doing this sum of the parts calculation. I'd see very clearly that the sum of the parts was much higher than the share price and then buy it, hoping that gap would close. Now I've had kind of about four 
[P134]  investments in this area. And in three of them, I lost money. And a pretty significant amount. So that was definitely an interesting learning point. The third point here is to try to find similarities in why I made the mistake. So I think the similarities here are pretty self-evident. It's just looking at businesses where the sum of the parts is higher than the stock price. I know that this is a thought pattern that has attracted me in the past and has destroyed capital. So if I'm looking at newer investments, I can use that to my advantage. So that leads to the fourth point here, which is avoid these patterns as part of your analysis. 
[P135]  So now that I'm aware of this thought pattern, I know that if someone pitches me an idea or if I'm reading about an idea and the primary reason for this idea being attractive is some of the parts, well, it immediately goes into the too hard pile and I will immediately take a pass. So that's all I have for you today. If you want to interact with me on Twitter, please follow me at IrrationalMRKTS or on LinkedIn under Kyle Grief. If you enjoy my episodes, please feel free to let me know how I can make your listening experience even better. 
[P136]  for tuning in. Bye for now.

[P1] ﻿ You're listening to TIP. One key to some of the legendary investors' most significant investments was their deep understanding of a business. Whether you look at people like Warren Buffett, Leeloo, or Philip Fisher, these guys just knew how to understand a business better than nearly anybody else out there. They used this knowledge to their advantage, finding investments that were unloved or orphaned unnecessarily. Today, I will cover a wide range of people that you can talk to to understand a business 
[P2]  at an extremely high level. From my research into scuttlebutt, I found four primary parties that you want to talk to to improve your understanding of a business. I'll cover precisely who those parties are and what you should ask them to enhance your own business acumen. Now, you might be wondering, why should I add the scuttlebutt method when researching a stock? After all, isn't reading public information enough to understand the business? And to answer that, I would say, yeah, you probably can learn a lot about a company via public filings, 
[P3]  research reports, earnings calls, and earnings reports. But you will never understand a business to its full extent using these resources exclusively. If you want an edge in investing, you have to work for it. And Scuttlebutt is that edge that I think very few are willing to do, but the ones that are willing to do it can get these very, very outsized returns. This episode has some great case studies to really hammer home how important Scuttlebutt is. You'll learn how legends like Warren Buffett and Lee Liu have used Scuttlebutt to find incredible investments. 
[P4]  also review some other case studies from others that have successfully sleuthed a business and reaped some enormous benefits. And then to finish the episode off and stay with the ethos of improved learning, I wanted to weave in how you can use your circle of competence to better understand industries or business templates to either double down on or to avoid like the plague. Self-reflection and deep thinking are key to Warren Buffett's success, and I thought I'd share my framework as well for learning from my prior mistakes. If you're the type of person who enjoys introspective 
[P5]  resonate with my framework. Now, without further ado, let's get right into this week's episode. Welcome to The Investor's Podcast. I'm your host, Kyle Grieve. 
[P6]  which is Scuttlebutt, which was made famous by Philip Fisher in his wonderful book, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits. But I'm not going to go over just that book, which I did pretty recently. I'm actually going to focus on the theme of Scuttlebutt and look at a variety of really, really good resources that are going to help you become more proficient at deepening your own understanding of a business. Now, one of the most important parts of investing is gaining the conviction that the investing decisions that you make are correct. 
[P7]  conviction. Maybe you are looking at the numbers and seeing that the business is growing at a pace that you're happy with. Or perhaps the company launched a new product and you think they've executed flawlessly on that product launch. Or maybe you're tracking the returns on invested capital, or maybe their margin expansion, and you're observing that they're continuing to move in a desirable direction. Now, while there's nothing wrong with using these methods to improve your conviction, today we're going to look at an analytical method to really help improve your understanding of a business. And here's the thing, everyone has access. 
[P8]  to the information that I discussed above, right? I can log on to FinChat or Seeking Alpha and get these numbers pretty simply. But the problem is, in order to be successful with investing, you need a variant perception in order to take advantage of the markets. And learning info that is not contained in the financial statements of a business is one of the best ways, I think, that you can accomplish this. So today, we're going to be discussing, like I already mentioned, Scuttlebutt. Now, many listeners of TIP will be familiar with Scuttlebutt. It's a concept I spoke about on TIP 646. 
[P9]  For those who don't know what Scuttlebutt is, it's simply the process of learning about a business by accumulating information about that business by talking with people that are associated with the company. Now, people who are associated with the company could be a variety of people. It could be the CEO. It could be lower level employees. It could be the sales department. It could be people in research and development. It could also be customers, suppliers, and industry experts, et cetera. But let's circle back here to why Scuttlebutt is so essential. Let's say I know a retail business pretty well. 
[P10]  Let's call it ABC. Let's say I think the business is starting to get expensive. I have three pretty simple options. I can sell it, I can hold it, and I can buy more. Now, most investors will base which of these decisions they're going to make based on things like intrinsic value of the business, the evaluation of the company, its growth rates, understanding and evaluating management based on earnings calls. And that's all fine and dandy, but in the example above, I'm still making some sort of error. If I knew people intimately involved in the business and could ask them questions like, 
[P11]  at ABC during the holiday season, I might get information that is much more valuable than looking at just the information that I gave in the example here. Now, let's say I ask a lower level employee that same question, and the response is something along the lines of, work was swamped, items were flying off the shelves, and we couldn't replace them fast enough. Oh, also, we were also shown a video by management that thanked the employees for record sales in North America and e-commerce. Now, once you hear this news, you probably won't be in such a rush to sell 
[P12]  shares as it means the business is continuing to improve. This is a real case study for me. And after hearing it, I knew I'd hold my shares longer and I still do. But this is news I wouldn't have ever been able to use in my analysis if I didn't know the people in the industry or know the people who are familiar with that business. I know people like Philip Fisher would agree that Scuttlebutt is integral to the success of many great investors. So today we're going to cover legendary investors and their Scuttlebutt strategies. We're going to look at things like how Warren got a masterclass in insurance, 
[P13]  We'll look at how Lee Liu befriended a board member of Timberland to help him better understand the integrity and talent of the management team there. And I'm going to sprinkle in plenty of my own stories of scuttlebutt that I think will resonate very, very well with you. But first, a fair warning. Consider a few things first if you want to do scuttlebutt or sleuthing, which I'm going to be using interchangeably here. So first of all, it takes a lot of time. Now, I can go through a company's financial statements or official documents. It's still going to take a lot of time, right? 
[P14]  once you start understanding all the different layers of scuttlebutt that you can do, you can spend a lot of time on just one simple business. And if you want to talk to all the different parties that I'm going to be talking with today, I mean, you could easily make that into a full-time job, which some people do. So just understand that while I think this is the best way to understand a business at a very, very deep level, you're only going to be able to do so much of it. You're not going to be able to do all of it and that's okay. But I think adding little bits and pieces of what I'm going to be covering today is going to be really, really helpful. 
[P15]  So second point here is that it works really well with a concentrated portfolio. As I just alluded to here, if one business can take 40, 80, 100 hours to sleuth or to understand better, that's going to be a business that probably you want to put a lot of money behind. And it's not going to be something where you're going to want to just put 1% in. And on top of that, if you just put doing 1% positions, that means that you probably have a lot of position that if you want to do really, really deep research on a lot of positions, it's nearly impossible. 
[P16]  to do by yourself. And maybe you would need a team of other people to help you out with that. And then the last thing here is that it just requires doing a lot of work that very, very few others will do. And that's why it's so valuable. So if you're the type of person who likes going that extra mile and wants to get that just small little edge, I think this is going to be an area of your analysis that you should spend some time on improving on. And then finally here, I just want to get this out of the way. I'm not describing anything illegal like insider training. That's not what scuttlebutter sleuthing is. 
[P17]  So there was a really good book that I read in prepping for this episode called Scuttlebutt Investor. And so here's what the definition of scuttlebutt was. The origin of the term is related to sailing. Water for consumption on sailing ships was typically stored in a scuttlebutt, a butt or a cask, which had been scuttled by making a hole in it so the water could be withdrawn. Since sailors exchanged gossip when they gathered at the scuttlebutt for a drink of water, scuttlebutt became slang for gossip or rumors. 
[P18]  equivalent of water cooler talk. Now, another reason that Scuttlebutt is so important is related to a wonderful Charlie Munger quote. He said, I never disagree with someone else's opinion unless I understand their side better than they do. Now, in my opinion, Scuttlebutt will help you determine if a business would make a better short than a long. Now, I personally have never shorted a stock in my life, but I think if a company is likely to go down in price, that's probably a pretty good thing to know if I'm contemplating going long on that idea. Now, suppose you know that a business has, 
[P19]  a 90% customer concentration. And that one customer who made up 90% was just lost. In that case, that's probably really, really good evidence that the company is likely to be worth just a lot less once that news comes out and probably for a long time into the future, maybe forever into the future. Scuttlebutt can help you determine which types of events can build or destroy conviction. So there's a business that I loosely followed. It's a microcap called Avricor Health. This business just crushed it going from about $0.07 
[P20]  to 24 cents in less than a year. Then they announced a strategic shift away from pharmacies in Canada and that they would actually be going towards going international. And now the price has dropped back down to 4 cents. So hypothetically speaking, if someone could chat with the people who were sending checks or who were the actual customers of Avricor from the pharmacies that were leaving, they would have learned that that relationship had been severed or funding had been cut and they probably could have gotten out before this massive rundown and they maybe could 
[P21]  understood that this business was going to lose their customer even earlier than the market actually did. So that's the kind of information that you can get from doing Scuttlebutt. Now let's get into the meat of today's episode and talk about how we do Scuttlebutt. The way I see it, there are kind of four primary parties that we want to talk to, to understand the state of a business. The first one is going to be customers. The second one is going to be employees. Number three would be suppliers. And the fourth is specialists. So in his excellent book, which I'm going to be referring to a lot here today, which is called The Sleuth Investor, the author, Abner Mandelman, 
[P22]  added a fifth party, which he likes to look at, which is plant and periphery. Now, he made a really good case as to why this is important. And I think it is important, but we're not going to be covering that today because I want to focus more on the relationship aspect of talking with actual people. And while observing physical things is great and definitely helpful, it just isn't going to be something that I'm going to cover today because I think it would probably take too much time. So each of these four parties can be further broken down by quite a bit, and that's what we're going to spend some more time here doing right now. 
[P23]  Customers. So customers are people like end users. These are people who determine if the product should be purchased or if it should pass on for a competing product. These are the people who send the checks to the company to actually buy the product. You can look at current customers. You can look at former customers. You can look at potential customers. The next section here is employees. So employees is a place where I think a lot of people probably spend a lot of their time, although I think customers might actually be the most important. 
[P24]  But what makes up employees? So you got people like lower level employees, people working machinery, if that's what the kind of business utilizes. You got people in sales and marketing department. You got C-suites, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officers. You got people in research and development, people on the boards of directors. And then you can also look at current employees, former employees, and then also the employees of competitors of that business or in a specific industry. 
[P25]  there's kind of three main groups. You're looking at current suppliers, former suppliers, and potential suppliers. And then when you're looking at specialists, there's a whole bunch of different people you'd look at. Competitors, shareholders, other analysts, whether they're professional retail analysts, industry insiders, people who are doing the local news, and maybe even chambers of commerce. Now, let's start here with the most important people to speak to, which is customers. So I already mentioned here that I'm going to be using scuttlebutt and the word sleuthing 
[P26]  interchangeably. So sleuthing was very well covered by Abner Manelman in his book, The Sleuth Investor. So Abner writes, in investment sleuthing, you use detection and investigatory techniques to get exclusive physical information about companies in which you are considering investing. Little known facts about a company can give you a decisive edge when buying or selling that company's stock. So I just wanted to give you that definition. He talks a little bit about scuttlebutt and he, I believe, considers them to be pretty much the same thing as well. Although I will admit that in Abner's 
[P27]  book, he goes much more in-depth into sleuthing. So Abner says, and I agree, that you can learn just an inordinate amount about a business from understanding its customers at a very deep level. So he poses just four kind of questions to better understand a business by talking to its customers. So the first one is, who are the customers? The second one is, what exactly is being purchased? The third is, what is actually being sold? And the fourth is, why would the customer buy from the business in question versus a competitor? So let's break these down in a little more detail. 
[P28]  first question about who the customer is, is very, very essential. After all, it's the customers who are going to be sending checks to the company, which eventually shows up in the top line as revenue. So Abner breaks down customers into three primary categories. So the first are the end users. Let's imagine that we're looking at a software company. This would be people who use the actual software, maybe as part of their daily life or as part of their job. So these are the people who might actually use the software, 
[P29]  not actually be in charge of actually buying the software. But they might, you know, obviously like the product so much that they're going to recommend that they use a specific product to the people who actually do send the checks. So these types of people, you know, if they're using a software that they can't live without, that's obviously very, very important because it means that the people who are sending checks probably also know that. And it means that the checks are going to keep on coming in. That is a good segue here to the second customer, which are the decision makers. These are the people that might not actually physically write and send the checks, 
[P30]  but they can approve if a specific product is purchased. So these two people sometimes are the same person, sometimes aren't the same person. And then the third and final type of customer are just the people that sign and send the checks. Again, they might not actually be the end user. A very, very important distinction. So the perfect customer is when the same person does all three of these functions, but that's just not always the case. I sleuthed this exact question on a business that sells software to petroleum engineers, 
[P31]  someone who was a customer of the business and used the product. So if I look at it in the framework used above, the person I spoke to fulfilled probably the first and second functions of the customers. So they got to be the end user and they got to tell someone to basically send the check so that they could continue using it. But they didn't actually send the check themselves. Now, from what I learned about chatting with this person, it was pretty easy for them to get the software if they needed it. Luckily, the software is in kind of a duopoly. So the options are very limited. 
[P32]  got A or B. Now, the reason it's so important to understand these three customer categories is because there can be a specific relationship where a business isn't necessarily selling its product to the right person. So Abner has a really, really good example in his book where he discussed this fictitious company called Alpaca Systems. So this business sold customer relation management CRM software to retail stock brokers. So let's use just Abner's framework in this case study. So who are the customers? So the customers were the retail broker's manager, 
[P33]  and the retail brokers. Second question, what exactly is each customer buying? The manager was actually buying control of the brokers and the brokers were getting help with improving their productivity. But as a result of using this software, they're actually losing control over their own clients. So the third question here is what exactly is Alpaca selling? So Admir initially thought that it was productivity tools, which it really was, but it was also control over the brokers. And Alpaca, the business, 
[P34]  didn't actually realize this at the time. So the fourth question is, why would the customer buy it? And so if you look at the broker's managers, they bought it because the software worked. And if the broker's produced at a high level, they got higher bonuses. Additionally, it gave the firm even more control over the broker's clients because they knew more about every one of their clients. But there was a problem here. And that was that if a broker wanted to switch firms, they often needed control of their own clients. If they wanted to switch firms and weren't going to bring any clients over, 
[P35]  valuable to the new firm. And unfortunately, the Alpaca system didn't allow this. So even if the brokers were using the Alpaca system, they actually weren't using it to its full capabilities. They were doing things like keeping paper records and keeping copies of their customer's info at home. That way, that gave them more control over their clients if they wanted to eventually leave their former company. So Abner wrote, while Alpaca thought it was only selling higher productivity to its product users, it was also unknowingly helping its users' employers enslave them. 
[P36]  one of the best examples I can give of a strategic mistake. And it is one I would likely never have grasped if I had not talked to the final product users directly. Certainly, no brokerage analyst would dare to write up the above in a research report. Now, once Abner learned about this part of the business, he kind of stopped sleuthing it at a deep level and he loosely followed it. But fast forward a little bit and he actually observed that Alpaca eventually did something quite brilliant. They actually fired their customers who are the broker's managers. And instead of selling to the broker's managers, 
[P37]  sold directly to the brokers themselves. So they geared the software to the specific brokers and they targeted just the highest earners. This allowed the brokers to improve productivity by using the software while allowing them to keep control over their own clients. So if they wanted to leave, the software would still work with them even if they left to go to a different firm. Now, this is the type of information that is readily available to anyone who's willing to go and look for it, but very few people do this kind of work. 
[P38]  in a business's financial document and use things like Google or ChatGPT to get questions answered. Now, while this is better than doing nothing, it won't give you the type of informational advantage because anybody with a computer and an internet connection can have the same access as you. Let's look at another just classic example of scuttlebutt that Warren Buffett did a few decades ago. This concerned a business most listeners are going to be familiar with, American Express. Warren had owned American Express stock more than once, 
[P39]  time. So it's part of his business analysis. So we're going to go over the first time here. And this was during the salad oil scandal. So my colleague, Clay, actually just went over that in some detail on TIP682, which I'll get linked up here. So I won't go into too much depth into it. But I will say that essentially what happened was that the market assumed the salad oil scandal would be really bad for the business of American Express. But Warren, he could have just read what was written in the paper, read what all other investors were reading, and concluded the same thing. 
[P40]  Outside of it, he did his own scuttlebutt and realized that the scandal that was going on didn't actually affect American Express's business. So let's go over that in some more detail. Since he could tell their financial health was okay from reading public documents, he then tasked himself with finding out about the customers of American Express and if they were behaving any differently than from before the scandal had happened. He had a very simple way of doing this. He just simply went to places that accepted American Express and he hung around the cash register. 
[P41]  were still using the American Express card, and he asked if the customer behavior had changed at all. Once he deemed that their behavior had not changed, he knew that American Express was an opportunity that was lying in the open for him to take advantage of, which he did to quite a high degree of success. Now, I'll reiterate here that scuttlebutt he did could not be gleaned from public information. If something like this happened today, it wouldn't be that hard to reach out to a family member or friends or colleagues that had an American Express card and ask them if they're still using one. I know I own one personally. If something like this happened today, 
[P42]  I would continue using my Amex card as long as vendors accepted it and as long as I got my bonuses points. Let's take a quick break and hear from today's sponsors. 
[P43]  may be, and then answer your question. The best part is that every portion of the answer is cited with the source document. Now, if you've tried to do any of this in ChatGBT, you may know that the answers are often wrong or full of hallucinations. The way Fintool is able to outperform ChatGBT is their focus on the SEC filings. If you're an analyst or a portfolio manager at a hedge fund, check them out at Fintool.com. That's Fintool.com. 
[P44]  one thing for sure. If I want my business to succeed, I need a good-looking website. Bluehost makes getting a website up and running easier than ever before.

[P47]  Thank you. 
[P48]  ta.com slash billionaires. All right, back to the show. 
[P49]  is they're going to give you unique insights that current customers might not provide because they probably don't have a filter and maybe they're not in love with that product compared to current customers. So they can give you different perspectives. So from potential customers, you can just learn things like why they're doing business with the business competitor. That alone is a really, really good question to ask because chances are they might've actually tried the product of the business that you're looking at and they're going to be able to compare that to different competitors' products 
[P50]  why they think one product is better than another. And sometimes you might find that the business that you're looking at has an inferior product. And that's a very, very important thing to know. Essentially, what you're trying to do is find out why they aren't a customer. And that alone can really, really help you illuminate any of the business's weaknesses that it might have. So former customers can tell you a lot of things. They can tell you why they stopped paying the business in question. They can tell you what's better or worse with the new business that they're working with. 
[P51]  costs that were involved from using one product to switching to another product. And the thing that's really good about former customers is just the amount of honesty that you're probably going to get. They're probably going to think maybe about that business and not so bright of a light, which could obviously bias them in other directions. But I think it's just a good way to get a variety of different perspectives and really, really get to the truth of why a company's products are better or worse than its competitors, or maybe they're all the same. You never know. 
[P52]  I think that this information is really useful because it can really help you identify potential red flags that you might not be able to identify in any other way. Now let's move on to what you can learn from a business as employees. This includes people from factory workers all the way up to the CEO. These are going to be people like low-level employees, people involved in marketing the business or selling products to customers, executives of a variety of different executives, research and development, board of directors, current employees, former employees, and even competitors. 
[P53]  employees. One of the cool things you can do when you're first starting this is just make a list, try to find current and former employees. Former employees is a little bit harder to figure out. I personally haven't really figured that out yet, but for current employees, you want things like names, find out their connections to people inside of the business or outside of the business, and just get as much detail as you can on people. For lower level employees, it can be a little bit harder to find them as they're not necessarily featured on a business's website. If you look at the proxy statement or 
[P54]  a circular of a business, they're going to tell you quite clearly who are management, who are the board directors. So those names are easy to come across. But if you are looking for lower level employees, sometimes if you go to a company's website, you can see if they have an about me section. And sometimes the about me section will actually talk about lower level employees, maybe have some quotes. And these quotes are usually, I don't even know if these quotes are actually from the employees, but sometimes they share their name. So an easy way to find out these employees is put their name into 
[P55]  or put their name into LinkedIn. And that's the way that I personally have found a ton of employees. And then even if you can't find the names of employees, LinkedIn is still super helpful. So if you use the search function on LinkedIn, there's actually quite a bit of information you can find. So you can go on LinkedIn, use the search function, look at the name of the company that you're looking for. Then you go to the people tab and basically all the company's employees who are on LinkedIn who list that business as their employer will be on there. Then you can try to reach out to them on LinkedIn. 
[P56]  Now, I'll be honest with you, from my experience, this is more of a volume game. I think with LinkedIn, a lot of people use LinkedIn for jobs. So if they already have a job, they're not necessarily going to be on there probably very often. Some people are, some people aren't. And so, like I said, volume game, you got to just try to connect with people, shoot them a DM. And there's probably a good chance a lot of people won't answer you. And that's okay. That's just kind of part of the scuttlebutt process. But there are enough people that will answer you that I think it's worth it. So Philip Fisher had some great strategies. 
[P57]  for Scuttlebutt when it came specifically to this segment here about employees. So when Philip sought answers to questions about what you should look for in investment with a lot of potential, he wrote, 
[P58]  functions form a worthwhile conclusion as to whether the particular company has outstanding potentialities for growth and development. Now, the problem is that getting information from key personnel can be quite difficult because oftentimes these people are very, very successful. And part of that success means that they're probably working a lot. And they also work for very, very successful companies, which have very high expectations. So a lot of times they're not necessarily going to be too eager to just talk to some stranger about their job. 
[P59]  Some of these people, for instance, in research and development, they're probably not going to be too interested in sharing the stuff that they're working on if there's people from competitors that are listening in or whatever, or maybe some of them even have non-disclosure agreements where they can't talk about it. But nonetheless, Phil liked to look at people in things like the research and development departments as well as salespeople. He wanted to know specifically to do with salespeople if the business had the right people inside of it to continue growing. 
[P60]  the heads of departments, but also just from lower level people in sales as well. So things that I like to find out from salespeople are, you know, just ask them how things are going. Are they enjoying their job? Are they disliking their job? Are they busy? You know, do they have a lot of time on their hands or are they swamped? Obviously, you know, that can help you understand more. If someone goes from being not so busy to super busy, well, maybe there's something interesting going on in that business. You might find out how they're incentivized. Incentivization systems are easy to find on public documentations for management, 
[P61]  not necessarily for employees. So I'm not going to tell you to go and ask how much money someone makes, but if you just ask them how they're incentivized, is it based off of a commission or whatever, that's important information. And if you develop some sort of relationship, I think you can probably get that kind of information. Other things that are really interesting to get is their thoughts on management. Do they like management or do they dislike management? I think that's pretty interesting to know. And if everyone dislikes management, well, that's probably a pretty big red flag. 
[P62]  business. If you talk to a bunch of people and they're all seemingly pretty down on the business, well, that's an interesting sign. And also on the other side, if everyone's very, very happy about the business and giddy and excited, well, that's another really, really good sign as well. And then if you're talking to people about their job and you find out that maybe a bunch of their colleagues got fired and aren't being replaced by new people, I mean, that alone is a really good signal that maybe the business is very unlikely to increase its sales anytime soon. 
[P63]  lot of emphasis on was research and development. He knew that a business that had the potential to be worth multiples of what it was today needed an R&D department that could continue to push the company to create new, innovative, and excellent products that also had the right salespeople in place to go out and actually sell that product to the market. So I think you can kind of lump these two areas together to some degree. So there's this trust manufacturer that I own, and it's in the beginning stages of utilizing automation to increase its output by nearly doubling it in a very short period of time, 
[P64]  the automation equipment's completely installed. I've had the chance to speak with management multiple times and done my best to learn more about who supplies their technology and how it's going to work once it's fully installed and operational. Now, one of the main problems this business will eventually face is that they will be able to double their capacity. Now, on the face of things, this is obviously great. A company that can double capacity with minimal incremental expenses is a very good thing. Still, there's another potential area that must be addressed for this whole process to be successful, and that is that they have to have the sales 
[P65]  people to go out and sell that additional capacity to the market. So I got a chance to reach out to a salesperson in that business. And so I asked them a few things to understand things like how the process is going with sales. I want to know, are they busy? Get a read of how things are going so that I can hopefully be directionally correct. Are they happy with the process? Are they unhappy, lukewarm? I want to know things like, are they adding you salespeople to the team? If they're adding, that's generally a good sign that hopefully there's additional demand 
[P66]  for their product or that they're able to find additional customers to try and send people out to sell to. Another question would be, how is the automation equipment going to impact their customers? Are their customers going to get cost savings, improve service, and things like that? So if you have the ability to chat with current employees, a few things that you should try to learn, gauge their temperature on the company, find out if they're overworked or underworked, find out how promotions are handed out. Are they happy with them? Are they unhappy with them? Find out how they're incentivized. 
[P67]  and which KPIs they're incentivized on. Find out what they think of management. Find out if employees are being brought into the business, who are they being brought in from? Is your company sealing employees from maybe competitors? Is it a specific competitor? And then on the other hand, if employees are exiting, you should try and find out where they're getting their job. Are they going to a specific competitor? These are all interesting points to improve your decision-making. So in the sleuth investor, Admir says one of his favorite tools for learning information 
[P68]  just having beers with employees. Now, this is a method that I haven't had the time to try out yet, but I can see how valuable it would be. If you can speak with employees when they're in more of a casual setting, you're likely to get better information than if you maybe just go to the IR office of a business that's in your local neighborhood and they're just showing you around the workplace. In that scenario, you might just get people that are going to be on their best behavior, even if maybe they don't necessarily 
[P69]  and make the optics look good. But in an informal setting, you may get people to open up more. But like I said, I do realize this is a lot of work, which is why I still haven't gotten around to trying it myself. A few other people who are worth chatting with are members of the board of directors. Although they have to be very, very cautious about what they say, this is probably good. You don't want them getting in trouble, giving insider information, but they can still be pretty good sources of information. A few things that you can learn from them would be, 
[P70]  to the company? Are they actually doing something to provide value to that board? Or are they just there to pump up the CEO and agree with everything that he says? You may want to find out how they came about that board seat. Was it because they went to college with the CEO or someone else on the board or maybe another executive? Or was it because they've been in the industry for 30 years and they've done incredibly well with other businesses? You should look at the track record of board members. Do they have a long track record of success or 
[P71]  failure with some of the other businesses that maybe they've either managed or been a board member of. And then another one here that I think is really important is what are they doing for income? Is this board seat their primary source of income? Because if they're only getting income from being on boards of a few companies, that's very important because that means that they're probably not going to go out of their way to make things difficult if they see that things aren't being managed properly. 
[P72]  is not the CEO. But if you have someone who really needs to keep their board seat, chances are they're more likely to be leaning towards agreeing with the CEO to not make their job get into any jeopardy. So another great lesson that I've learned from talking with employees was one of Buffett's most famous investments, which was Geico. So Buffett learned about Geico when he was still a student of Benjamin Graham's at Columbia University. So he was in the library one day and he realized that Benjamin Graham, 
[P73]  was the chairman of GEICO. So I think this was just like a week later, he ended up making the trek to Washington on a weekend. And he got to the GEICO HQ, but was disappointed to learn that the doors were locked, that the location was closed for business. Luckily, there was a janitor who was working in there and let Buffett in. And so the janitor brought Warren to Lorimer Davidson, and who was the only person who was working in that day. And he actually spent four hours answering just endless questions from a young and curious Warren Buffett about 
[P74]  Geico, and just the insurance business in general. Warren said this one event changed his life. Now, this story has many interesting implications. It shows that you need the drive to go and do things that 99.99% of investors just won't do, like travel on a weekend to a company's headquarters. You need to be curious about the business and come prepared with questions to show people that you really understand them to some degree. And you also need a bit of luck. If the janitor was on a break or didn't want to be bothered, he may never have let 
[P75]  passed on that business if he didn't have the drive to go and give the headquarters another visit. Now let's transition here and discuss another critical area of a business's operations, which is its suppliers. This is an area that Philip Fisher didn't spend too much time on in common stocks and on common profits. So we're going to look at two other books, The Sleuth Investor and Scuttlebutt Investor for some ideas on why and how we should look at suppliers to kind of better understand that relationship between a company and its suppliers. 
[P76]  where Monish Pabrai was discussing win-win business relationships. Part of the reason for Charlie's love affair with Costco was that the business was in this win-win relationship. Suppliers won, just like shareholders and customers. This is a pretty rare relationship to find. That's not to say that you must have these types of relationships to find successful investments, but it doesn't hurt to find out more about the relationship that a company has with its suppliers. So here's what Monish said about win-lose relationships between a business and its suppliers. 
[P77]  which you could call win-lose. For example, there's a company that stretches out the payments they have to make to their suppliers. Maybe they take 60 or 90 days to pay their suppliers and they use the float to improve their financials. Well, that works well for the company, but not so well for the suppliers. So that's kind of an example of a win-lose business. Now, businesses can still succeed with these win-lose relationships. But like I said before, it's important to understand this relationship in a little more detail. 
[P78]  to improve your decision-making. In The Sleuth Investor, Abner points out that you can go to the supply chain to understand the volumes and the prices of what's being supplied and what kind of volume a supplier is offering a business. Another strategy Abner likes is getting to understand potential suppliers. If a company could be boosted by having close relationships with better suppliers, they could see a significant boost in their value. Abner has a bunch of strategies that take a lot of work, but can be highly valuable to anyone who wants to put the effort in. Now, one great story from Abner's book was about 
[P79]  a sleuth he met, who he called Michelle. Michelle had a PhD in mathematical finance, and she was hired by a Canadian subsidiary of this US bank that had started an index fund. She told Admir that she'd made about $90,000 in the market in a very, very quick period of time using some of the interesting sleuthing techniques that she was lucky to be exposed to. Let's get into some of the details of how Michelle sleuthed and made this windfall. So across from Michelle's desk was the office of an investment bank, which Admir refers to as the bank of industry. Now, there are only two primary outcomes that would happen. 
[P80]  Either the debt would be restructured, which was very good for the company and the stock price, or the bankers would force the company to pay, which tended to be unfavorable for the business and its stock price. So it's easy to understand why. If a business has its interest payments cut, that means its pre-tax income goes up and earnings will probably show a bump. If a company must pay increased interest expense, pre-tax income decreases and earnings will suffer. So Michelle had observed that there was an ad agency that she watched where the business borrowed about $10 million from this bank. 
[P81]  And unfortunately, what happened was the company lost a key customer. Now, the bank of industry, in order to recoup its debt, wanted the business to slash costs, basically fire people in order to raise money to service the debt. But the businesses, executives, and key personnel threatened to quit en masse if the business started doing this. Now, this was a horrible proposition to the bank because for this business, employees and executives were not easily replaceable. 
[P82]  likely be next to useless. So the bank relented, and once the debt was restructured, the share price increased by 50% in a very, very short period of time. Now, knowing this case study, Michelle dreamt of being a fly on the wall in one of these meetings. Now, obviously, there was no way for her to arrange this and taking advantage of it would be illegal anyway, but there were other ways for her to sleuth legally, which she ended up doing. So she was just a keen observer of people, and most of the time, the bankers were very cool, calm, and collected, while the business executives who were coming in to talk 
[P83]  their bankers were more nervous when they were walking in, while the business's executives were nervous walking in. But on one occasion, she observed the complete opposite. The executives looked calm entering the office while the bankers actually looked nervous. After the meeting had ended, she observed the nature of the bankers and the executives. And once again, the bankers looked ejected while the executives were high-fiving each other as they left the building. Now, during this process, she really wanted to know who this company was. And so she just looked at them and tried to find a logo or something 
[P84]  who they were and ended up seeing a logo on one of the shirts of one of the people that had been part of the meeting who worked for the business. So after that, she looked at their annual report and found the names and pictures of the executives, which she then used to verify their identity. It was indeed the company. Abner refers to it here as Filmex. It was similar to the ad agency case study I spoke about where cost cutting wasn't in the cards. So given the behavior of the bankers and the executives, it was quite clear to Michelle that the executives had just gotten a win in terms of their financial health. 
[P85]  buying shares and made about $90,000 over two days after the news of the restructuring had been announced to the public. Now here's an excellent summary of the experience. Michelle was not an employee of the bank of industry nor an employee of Filmex, not of their lawyers or accountants or anyone else defined by law as the company's insider. She had not bribed anyone nor stolen any information. She had merely observed some physical events that took place off of Filmex's premises in a public hallway. Yet she could say with an extremely high certainty that the business 
[P86]  industry was about to cut Filmex's debt and that Filmex's stock would in all likelihood soar as a result. Now, as the story of what illustrates, a business's supplier doesn't have to be the supplier in the traditional sense. It could be bankers as well. It's up to you to kind of think outside the box and use your opportunity set and skillset to find ways of observing things that are happening around you and things that you can use to your own advantage.

If you happen to find current suppliers, there's a few things that you're going to want to find out. And these are things like, how big of a customer is the company for the supplier? If the supplier is the only supplier of a particular material to the company in question, how easy it would be for a company to find an alternative supplier. 
[P94]  an idea of what the supplier thinks of the company that they supply to. Do they like them or do they speak about them in negative terms? A few themes here that you want to dig into is just how critical a supplier is to your business. If your business can't run without one supplier, that information is very, very key. If something were to happen to that supplier, then your business would essentially be done if the supplier could no longer supply the business. This is why having a business with multiple suppliers is good and a good thing to know. It protects you if something goes wrong with one supplier. 
[P95]  It's good to have another couple of suppliers on hand that you can use just in case something like that happens. Additionally, it also allows the business to negotiate rates between suppliers to find the best possible deal for the company. Also, if a supplier is the sole supplier of a key piece to many different businesses, you might run into just a great investing opportunity. There might be one supplier who's key to a whole bunch of different companies that require it for their business to run. ASML, I think, is a really good example here. 
[P96]  by no means a semiconductor specialist, but I know that that business supplies many semiconductor businesses, the machinery that's needed to manufacture their widgets. And for that reason, ASML has made an exceptional investment, compounding at 26% per annum over the last decade. Now, just like former employees, speaking with former suppliers can be a great source of information, as you're likely to get to the truth quickly. It also helps identify any potential weaknesses a business might have. You should probe into why the business relationship was severed, what the former supplier thinks of management, 
[P97]  the history of payments, whether they were on time or late, negotiating leverage between the supplier and the company, etc. If you find out the supplier left because it was constantly being squeezed by the business, that's a red flag. And that might signal that there's other suppliers that may end up doing the same thing in the future. Now, let's look at specialists or people who aren't intimately involved in a business sense, but can be invaluable in learning more about the business. They're often very willing to chat and share their knowledge. The most important people to talk to in this segment, I think, are the business's competitors. 
[P98]  Let's say you speak with five businesses that are competing with the business that you're researching, and they all identify the business that you're looking at as the business that they fear the most. In that case, that's a very, very good indicator that you've identified the leader in that industry or niche. If, on the other hand, all your scuttlebutt identifies a different business as the one that scares everyone else the most, well, maybe that means you're looking at the wrong business. Now, here's some questions that you can ask to understand competitors and their dynamics concerning the business that you're doing scuttlebutt on. Which competitors scare you the most? 
[P99]  and why? Which competitors scare you the least and why? Who are your suppliers? What are the biggest hurdles to success in the industry today? And what are you doing to overcome them? Are you hiring employees or firing employees? And if the competition is firing employees, who are they going to? And if they're hiring new ones, where are they coming from? Now, arguably the lowest hanging fruit in the specialist category are analysts themselves. You can often get your hands on analyst reports. Buffett has famously said that he doesn't rely on other analysts to 
[P100]  do his decision making for him. And I completely agree with that. But if you find other thoughtful analysts, they might know things you don't. They can help guide or connect you with maybe people worth learning more from. Or they can just offer their opinion, which might be highly valuable on specific matters in the business that maybe you're just a little unfamiliar with. Now, usually when reading an analyst report, I enjoy learning about their particular perspective. They might have looked at a business differently than I have. And knowing this can be helpful in the scuttlebutt process. 
[P101]  that they are researching the business, they are more likely to contact you if you have further questions. But at the end of the day, Buffett is correct and you should never rent conviction from others on an idea. If you do this, you will lose money or you're going to make egregious mistakes during downturns. Now, similar to analysts are shareholders who are a very good source of information. Some of them might have already done a ton of scuttlebutt themselves and can help share information with you or guide you in the right direction. I can't tell you how vital this can be, especially when you're first learning about a new business 
[P102]  on. It can be hard to understand what makes a company fire on all cylinders when you first start researching it. However, current shareholders will have their hypothesis that they will share with you. So you can just go out and see if their hypothesis is correct or not and make your own. A few other areas I like looking at are industry insiders. You can find these people easily through Google. If you're researching a well-known company, you can often find news articles about it. And these articles themselves can be helpful on their own, but it's actually the list of the people that are referenced in articles that I personally find most 
[P103]  interesting. You can see who was quoted and you can reach out to them as well as the original author and see what kind of information you can get. There's a small cap that I'm looking at right now. And I found an interesting article on bankruptcy in Canada. This has led me to contact the author and some of the bankruptcy lawyers in the industry that were mentioned in his article. I've been lucky enough to connect with the author who provided me with some very, very interesting information as well as some other resources. And from looking at some of the people he quoted in his article, I actually landed a call with the lawyer who specializes in that 
[P104]  Now, one of my favorite high-profile scuttlebutt techniques is from Leeloo, who my co-host, Clay, spoke about in depth on TIP 636. Leeloo gave an excellent case study about the importance of acting like a journalist when looking at a stock. One quote stuck out to me from his presentation, which was, you got to have a very active, very curious mind, and you can't be satisfied with bogus answers. He added, 
[P105]  go audit and leaves a trail of evidence of what kind of person they are and what they have done, how they deal with different situations. Leeloo mentions that as part of his scuttlebutt into Timberland, he went and spent a few weeks in the neighborhood where the family who owned the business lived. He mentioned things like going to their church and talking with their friends, their colleagues, and their neighbors. He would also ask what the manager did for the community and what people thought of him. He also mentions trying to learn about family dynamics, educational history, and their history in philanthropy. 
[P106]  that the son of the CEO was on a board and Leeloo managed to actually get on that board. He eventually became friends with the son and with that relationship, understood the business at an even deeper level. I love this story because it's proof that the further down the rabbit hole that you go, the better the picture of reality that you'll get. But I also have to admit that doing this is nearly impossible for the average person who can't spend weeks away from their job and may not have the means or even the inclination to put themselves up for weeks at a time. 
[P107]  In theory, it's great. You will 100% learn a lot about a person doing this. But in reality, I'm not sure even the top hedge fund managers worldwide are going to employ the strategy if they're managing billions of dollars. Maybe they could get someone like an analyst to get their boots on the ground and learn more about the managers that way. Now, with this thought, I want to move on to discuss some of the ways that you can use this information on Scuttlebutt to make better decisions without necessarily having to leave your home for weeks at a time and spending thousands of dollars on travel costs. 
[P108]  For those who can, well, congrats, but I think you're probably in the minority. I think what it really comes down to is building relationships. Someone like Warren Buffett has just a massive network of people who really, truly want to help him. And I think these are people that he could get some very high quality information just by picking up the phone and asking if they know someone in an industry or someone who maybe used to work in an industry that he's trying to learn more about. Now, I won't say that anybody can build as extensive a network as Warren Buffett. 
[P109]  I know I can't, but I think I can guarantee that you can connect with some very, very fascinating people if you put yourself out there and meet people, send emails to management or investor relations, and socialize with people on things like Twitter and LinkedIn. I wrote something up on Twitter about the trust manufacturer and had a follower of mine or reader of that tweet tell me that he used their product before as a customer. That opened up a wonderful conversation, direct messages, where I used some of the questions I listed earlier in the episode to learn more about why they went with that company and his thoughts on his 
[P110]  experience working with them. So even if you don't want to go full sleuth, I think many great points are here to help you get an informational advantage. Bill Miller says there's three advantages that investors can get, which is analytical, informational, and psychological. While I agree with Bill that the psychological edge is probably the easiest to get, but might be the hardest to portray in reality, anybody can get an informational edge if they're willing to speak to the right people and learn more about a business. Most investors base 100% of their decision 
[P111]  on accessible information, things like annual reports, quarterly reports, earnings releases, the Q&As, use items, and quantitative information that you can get on the internet. Now, like I've already kind of drilled this into, I hope, by now, the problem is that everyone has access to this information. So it's really hard to actually get a variant perception. But if you talk to the right people around a business, you can get information that maybe these massive investors or billion-dollar hedge fund managers don't have access to or aren't willing to put the work in to 
[P112]  get access to. And this is the kind of information that can keep you invested in a company when maybe hedge funds are dumping it. If you know the long-term fundamentals of the business are still in great shape, but investors are dumping due to maybe some short-term headwind, you can take advantage of this by buying more shares. But this exact scenario depends on your conviction about an idea. And finding hard to find physical information will be one underutilized way to build conviction that very few will try and find. 
[P113]  just a few ideas which can help propel you for many, many years. Now that you have a good idea of how to do scuttlebutt on a business, I want to share some interesting findings about how to continue improving your circle of competence. I think scuttlebutt and circle of competence are very closely related. Warren and Charlie have discussed at length how to understand the boundaries of your circle of competence, but there is an area I don't believe they've mentioned enough that I think has been integral to their improvement, but also my own improvement as an investor, as well as other investors that we've had on the show, such as John Huber. 
[P114]  And this is how to utilize journaling and self-reflection to become a better investor. Warren and Charlie have primarily stayed away from using words like journaling, meditation, or self-reflection, but I can only assume that during their thinking time, they're probably doing a lot of self-reflection. They're also so intelligent that they don't necessarily need to record their thoughts in a journal. However, for an average person like myself, it helps a lot to record some of my thoughts and experiences in a journal so that I can more easily reflect on them in the future. 
[P115]  from a wonderful interview the folks from Journalitic did with John Huber. In that chat, John said that one of the most significant use cases of his journaling was going back and looking at his mistakes. Since watching this, I've tried to journal more about my mistakes and get to the essence of why I made these mistakes. This alone has been very, very powerful for helping me improve. But there's another area of improvement that relates directly to the circle of competence. God and Bay had a great definition of what the circle of competence is. When you are unsure and doubtful about what you want to do, 
[P116]  do not do it. That's it. Now, the way that I've weaved this into my journaling is to look at some of my previous failures, which identify what I'm maybe unsure or doubtful about. Now, one of the failures that I've been reflecting on is probably going to go against the grain for many of the value investors that listen to this show. Many value investors like investments whose value comes from a business's assets. For instance, you might buy a company where the assets of a business are worth $2 billion while the company is only trading for a billion or $500 million. I've looked at a few of my previous investments and determined that I have 
[P117]  either made very little or lost money whenever I attempt to do this exact same thing. So from this, I can gain a new insight into where my circle of competence is strong or weak. And since my track record in this area is not good, I can assume that I'm weak. Reflecting on this, I found that a new principle was established. And so here's how I have it written in my journal. When looking at a business that is attractive primarily because it's valued below some of the parts, do not bother with the business. Instead, focus on the business from a future earnings power perspective. 
[P118]  can be seen as downside protection, but not as a reason to purchase. I think NRP is a good example of this, where I care mostly about earnings power, but the assets provide a decent floor if something were to happen to the earnings stream. Now, this is a principle that I've naturally gravitated towards over the last few years, but I think it's been worth reflecting on to ensure that I'm not making, hopefully, money-losing decisions in the future. Another interesting lesson here is to track your decision-making as often as possible. You want data points that you can use in the future to help you understand 
[P119]  where your strengths and weaknesses lie. An app that I'd highly recommend is Journalitic, which offers you just a ton of data for free. They're also very eager to improve their platform to make it more and more valuable for its users. On a recent trip to New York, I was chatting about predictions with members of the Richer, Wiser, Happier Masterclass at a dinner. Part of Journalitic allows you to make predictions with an established due date. Humorously, I made a prediction back in September of 2024, and that was that the share price of Dino Polska was unlikely to move due to a lack of new store openings. 
[P120]  So I was alerted by the app at the end of 2024, about three months later. And when I checked the share price, I realized that it already appreciated by about 33%. So we all had a good laugh. But really, this tells me a few things. A, I stink at making predictions. B, at least being wrong resulted in making money, which is great because I think it's usually the opposite way. And C, I should probably not bother making predictions in the future. Or if I do, I should heavily reduce the certainty that I'm going to be correct. Now, not only can journaling help you avoid mistakes, 
[P121]  it also illuminates your strengths. And if you continue investing in what you're strongest at, you tilt the odds in your favor that you will continue making these successful investments. If you can continue doubling down on your strengths while avoiding weaknesses, you should have a lot more success in investing. If you journal or even think deeply about mistakes, you're going to gain pretty significant insights into what you are doing that works and doesn't work. Additionally, you'll be able to save even more time as you learn what new ideas can go into the too hard pile at a much quicker pace. 
[P122]  Or if you identify a weakness in your thinking, if you have time to learn more, now you know certain areas you can learn about to maybe turn a weakness into a strength. To finish today's episode, I just want to go over five of my biggest takeaways that I think listeners can hopefully utilize to improve their scuttlebutt and decision making. So when discussing customers here, learning for customers is just crucial to learning about a business. You can take the Peter Lynch approach and research businesses that you're already a customer of. Lynch gave the example of going to the shopping mall and learning more about a business that way. You could talk with family. 
[P123]  friends, colleagues, to see which products they can't live without. You will understand the product and what makes it great if you are the customer. You will know why you use it versus the competitor. You'll appreciate the switching costs involved with using a different product. You'll know if the product keeps you as a captive customer and if you are annoyed or happy to pay more over time. For instance, I see the price of streaming services continue to increase while I think the service isn't getting any better. Amazon hasn't really increased prices, but now it shows ads every time I watch it. Netflix, 
[P124]  continues raising its ad-free prices or allows users to go with ads, but at a reduced price. And Disney seems to be just increasing its prices, but not showing hats. So I know personally that I like Netflix's library the most and the pain from having to pay more hasn't forced me to cancel yet. But if you think in this light about the product of a business you're researching, you're going to learn some very valuable information. The second point here is just on sleuthing employees. So if you're talking with a CEO and they say that part of the reason 
[P125]  business has had so much success is because of the culture. You're only going to really know this if you start talking with people that are intimately involved with the business. A CEO can, of course, say a culture is good. And then when you talk to people, find out that the culture is horrible or there is no culture. And that's very important information because culture is very, very important, especially if you're a long-term investor. And the only way that you're going to find this out is from talking with employees, or you're going to find out when it's too late and the share prices is probably going to go down on you. 
[P126]  learn a lot about actual management from talking with employees. They can help you understand if a management is well-liked and effective. If everyone dislikes management, that's a pretty red flag. And that means that you should probably find out why. And if maybe there's a suitable replacement who might be even better than the current management. Another good thing about talking with employees is getting an update on the business. I luckily know a few CEOs of companies that I own, and they've been invaluable to me when I have questions to ask or want an update, or maybe there's a gray area that I want to understand better. If you go to events where CEOs go, 
[P127]  trade shows or something like that. I don't think it's too tough to establish some rapport with them where they're more likely to answer your questions in the future. So a third one here on suppliers, for me personally, I'm a long-term investor. So sleuthing for events that are only going to make a difference to the share price for a quarter or two, or even a couple of days, it just doesn't interest me very much. So the part about suppliers that interests me the most is finding out how they're involved in a business supply chain I'm looking at. 
[P128]  with a company and wants to keep their business and has great relationships, that's very, very valuable. And it shows that hopefully this business will continue being supplied by their suppliers for a long period of time. For any investor, whether you're looking at a manufacturer or a tech business, there's usually a supplier angle. And I think learning more about that relationship can be very helpful in learning more about how just the business works. The other interesting part about suppliers is that finding out who they are can be pretty difficult at times. Some public companies might say explicitly in their documentation, but I think some of them also like to keep it a secret. 
[P129]  so as to not tip off any competition. Now, if that's the case, if they don't want to talk about it openly, it definitely requires some more work and innovation to find out who the suppliers are. You might have to reach out to management or employees to find out if they'll share it with you, or you can look at other competitors or industry insiders and try to get to suppliers that way. So the fourth area here is just talking to specialists. I love talking with specialists. I think it's a great source, 
[P130]  If you speak to someone who owns a stock, you're likely to hear very cheery news from other bulls about that company. In this sense, talking to someone who's short can actually be more helpful. You'll learn why they think the business will likely decrease in value or price, and then it's up to you to analyze if their evidence is more compelling than the evidence for the bulls. If it's more convincing than your current beliefs, you know that maybe you don't need to continue researching a stock, or maybe if you own it, then maybe you should sell it. 
[P131]  here. We talk about this a lot. I talk about this a lot. Everyone has biases and it can be very helpful to determine what that bias is before you talk to a specialist on a business. Because if you talk to someone and it's their biggest position, it's very likely that they're going to be thinking quite highly of it. So just understand that if you can find specialists that maybe have no vested interest in the business, that can be helpful because they don't have a financial bias. And hopefully that means that maybe some of the information you might get 
[P132]  be not distorted. So the last one here is about my framework for learning from mistakes. I wanted to just quickly discuss a general framework that I've used for learning from my own investing mistakes that I think will be very, very helpful. So I have kind of this four-step process, and I'll expand the example that I just used a few minutes ago here. So the first one is looking where your most significant losses are. So for me, I also look at businesses where perhaps the investment didn't lose money, but my thought process, 
[P133]  ended up being kind of wrong. So a good example of that is heritage growth properties where I made money on the investment, but I didn't see it as a successful investment because the thesis just didn't really play out as I thought. So the second part here is identify similar thought patterns. Some of my least successful investments have been when the primary driver of the investment, like I just said, was doing this sum of the parts calculation. I'd see very clearly that the sum of the parts was much higher than the share price and then buy it, hoping that gap would close. Now I've had kind of about four 
[P134]  investments in this area. And in three of them, I lost money. And a pretty significant amount. So that was definitely an interesting learning point. The third point here is to try to find similarities in why I made the mistake. So I think the similarities here are pretty self-evident. It's just looking at businesses where the sum of the parts is higher than the stock price. I know that this is a thought pattern that has attracted me in the past and has destroyed capital. So if I'm looking at newer investments, I can use that to my advantage. So that leads to the fourth point here, which is avoid these patterns as part of your analysis. 
[P135]  So now that I'm aware of this thought pattern, I know that if someone pitches me an idea or if I'm reading about an idea and the primary reason for this idea being attractive is some of the parts, well, it immediately goes into the too hard pile and I will immediately take a pass. So that's all I have for you today. If you want to interact with me on Twitter, please follow me at IrrationalMRKTS or on LinkedIn under Kyle Grief. If you enjoy my episodes, please feel free to let me know how I can make your listening experience even better. 
[P136]  for tuning in. Bye for now.

[P1] ﻿ About a year ago, I predicted the boat shoe trend. Yeah, I did. And can I be honest? Since then, I've been chasing that feeling. The feeling of predicting a trend and then seeing it in the real world, I imagine rivals the feeling of seeing your newborn baby for the first time. Like, I think I'll probably feel that excited again on the day that I give birth to my first child. That's the next time I'll feel that level of satisfaction, unless, 
[P2]  I'm able to successfully predict another trend before that, which is what I'm going to try to do today. Today, I am going to share with you my 2025 fashion trend predictions. If I can get even one of these right, I'll be able to match that feeling I got when I predicted the boat shoe coming back. But I'm being realistic here. I don't have a crystal ball. Some of these predictions are random gut feelings. 
[P3]  are based on what I've studied sort of starting to become popular over the past few years, but haven't fully gone mainstream yet. And I predict that this year they will go mainstream. So it's a combination of gut feelings and educated guesses. The educated guesses are less satisfying if they come true because it's like I saw it coming in the world, right? The gut feelings, those, if they come true, 
[P4]  more rewarding. So hopefully, well, whatever. I'll just be happy if I get anything right. So let's begin. 2025 fashion trend predictions. I briefly paused this episode of Anything Goes to let you know that this episode of Anything Goes is presented by Amazon. Getting sick is horrible enough. The getting better part shouldn't be horrible too. Waiting on hold for an appointment, sitting in crowded waiting rooms, 
[P5]  That's almost as bad as the sickness itself. Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy remove these painful parts of getting better with things like 24-7 virtual visits and prescriptions delivered to your door. Thanks to Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy for sponsoring today's episode. Now let's get back to the episode. We're starting out with the obvious. I've been talking about this for a while now, so this shouldn't be a shock to anyone. Minimalism. 
[P6]  a lifestyle perspective. I'm not talking about owning less clothes. I'm talking about minimalistic design, okay? Now, what is that, you may ask? Don't worry. I Googled it for you, and I have the definition right here. Minimalism is a style that prioritizes simplicity, clean lines, neutral colors, and timeless silhouettes, focusing on quality over quantity and emphasizing essential, versatile pieces rather than trendy, 
[P7]  clothing. Now, I've been talking about minimalism coming back for so long. I'm sick of talking about it, too. OK, so I won't overemphasize this point, but I think minimalism in one way or another is always in. I don't know. I even feel like the clean girl aesthetic of 2023, 2024 was kind of minimalist in a way because it was a sort of style that consisted of simplicity and clean 
[P8]  and neutral colors and timeless silhouettes. So, you know, when I say that minimalism is coming back, what comes to my mind is like 90s minimalism. Let's Google 90s minimalism. Okay, if you Google 90s minimalism, this is what comes up. I'm looking on British Vogue at an article called The Minimalist 90s Outfits Inspiring My Summer Wardrobe, just to give some examples of some minimalist outfits. 
[P9]  I see a plain white t-shirt with some simple pinstripe dress pants and a matching pinstripe dressy little vest. I see classic blue jeans. I see classic black boots. A lot of simple tank tops, t-shirts in neutral colors. Lots of black and white button down shirts. 
[P10]  simple dress pants or capris, classic just suit jackets, blazers, simple dresses that aren't super tight in neutral colors, lots of black boots, lots of plain, simple, flat loafers, black, white, brown. I mean, yeah, it's just, it's like, it's very, it's simple, but it does still have swag. And the swag element is what's really 
[P11]  really hard to put a finger on. Somehow 90s minimalism, when you Google it, it doesn't look boring. There's magic happening with it somehow. I don't know. I see 90s minimalism really being the main trend this year. And here's the thing. The truth of the matter is minimalism in clothing design is timeless. Like a white button down, a pair of blue jeans, a pair of black slacks, a pair of little simple black loafers, a black boot. 
[P12]  a white t-shirt. These things are never out. They are always in. So a lot of people I've seen online saying like, minimalism is just another trend. It's not preventing people from buying more stuff. People are going to buy minimalist design. And then when that's out, they're going to go and they're going to buy maximalist design again. Minimalist stuff is just as trendy as maximalist stuff. I actually disagree. There's kind of a debate happening on the internet around 
[P13]  whether or not minimalist designs are timeless, whether or not they come in and out of style. I definitely do think they have trendy moments, but I think unlike maximalist designs, they're always in and no one can change my mind. Okay. I think minimalist design is really going to be in, in 2025, but it's never going to be out because it's too simple to ever be in or out. You know what I'm saying? If you were doing sort of the clean girl aesthetic, 
[P14]  2024, 2023, 2024, which consisted of, you know, the slick back bun, the trench coats, the dress pants, the little loafers, the little button up shirts. It's just very like chic and classy. Literally, just by styling that slightly different, maybe doing your hair a little bit different, maybe accessorizing a little bit differently, you now have 90s minimalism, right? And then in a few years when there's a new sort of minimalist style that's in, you can, 
[P15]  reuse those pieces again. I just, I really do think when it comes to trends, any sort of minimalist trend to me is the safest one to buy into because you actually can reuse those pieces in a million different ways. So I think investing in good minimalist pieces, I would be shocked if you regretted it, you know, unless you're just a maximalist at heart and you don't like clothes like that. Fair enough. 
[P16]  buy, you know, good basics and stuff. Like I think that's going to be really in and styling them in unique ways that have sort of magic. I think that's going to be in, but I don't think it's something we're ever going to look back at and cringe at, which is cool. It's cool when a trend also is timeless and it's rare. So I think this is one of the rare times when something timeless will be trendy. Moving on. Okay. So in 2024, the concept of 
[P17]  Jane Birkening your bag. Are we remembering this? This is the concept of taking your purse and attaching a bunch of personalized objects onto it, tying a bandana onto it, putting little charms on it, attaching jewelry to it, inspired by Jane Birken of the 60s, who carried around her iconic Birken bag that she attached a bunch of little accessories to that were personal to her. 
[P18]  and then gets a bit warm and then ties it around her purse to give her neck some air. That's the idea, right? Organically and authentically accessorizing her purse through necessity and convenience, weirdly enough, became a trend in 2024 where everybody was buying charms and finding bandanas and things in their drawers and then adding it to their bag to make it look authentic like Jane Birkin's bag. Fascinating trend. 
[P19]  think it's ending in 2025. I think it's going to expand in 2025. In 2024, it was all about the bag, right? Accessorizing the bag in that way. I think in 2025, it's about doing that with everything, okay? Your favorite hat, put a bunch of pins on it. Embroider a heart into it. Put a patch on it. On your jacket, there's a rip. You sew it with contrasting thread. Let's say it's a black jacket. You fix the 
[P20]  the rip with white thick thread, you know, you put pins on it, you put patches on it, your favorite pair of jeans, you put little accessories on the belt loops. You again, put patches, sew up the holes with bright thread, you know, paint your name onto the pocket, like accessorize, accessorize, accessorize with shoes, paint on your shoes. Like you get what I'm saying? Like making your pieces, 
[P21]  really, really unique to you. Because I think that what's going on right now is that a lot of people are craving a sense of personal style. And I've seen a lot of discourse around personal style and how personal style is sort of dead because of the internet. Whether or not that's true, that's a conversation for another day. But I think this idea of personalization is going to give people the feeling of personal style. Because 
[P22]  you can have the same pair of jeans as somebody else. In fact, you probably do. What sets you apart is how you personalize them. What sets them apart is that it's the pair that is your favorite that you wear three days a week. You know, this idea of really personalizing your items and having less items as well. Because I think prior to recently, it's been all about having a lot of stuff, having a lot of clothes, especially if you're into fashion, having as many options as possible so that you can constantly 
[P23]  be wearing a new outfit. That was sort of trendy, right? For many years to always be wearing a new outfit, to never wear the same outfit twice. I think that that's out. And I think having signature pieces that are super personalized that you wear over and over and over again and you style a multitude of ways, I think that's in. I even thought about it in terms of the Stanley Cup, which is not really a fashionable thing. That's more of like a pop culture obsession. 
[P24]  a Stanley Cup. I have a Stanley Cup. But I even thought about it like this. Like, this is almost a metaphor for what I mean for fashion in like clothing and stuff. It's the idea of like, instead of having every single color of Stanley Cup, instead of having the bright pink one and the blue one and the sparkly white one and the brown one and the orange one and the green one, you just have one that's your favorite color and you put stickers on it. You take your watch 
[P25]  the middle of the day and you attach it to your Stanley cup and you, it's like truly a utilitarian, like fully functional item. And it is your personal favorite item. It becomes a special thing to you. If you only have one and the one that you do have, you use every day or very consistently. And it looks like you, it becomes your iconic Stanley cup. That I think is going to be cool. That's going to be the way that we 
[P26]  consume, I think, in 2025. Instead of having nine pairs of jeans, you have two and they're both really special. And they're known as like, oh, those are Emma's jeans. Like if somebody were to see your signature pair of jeans on a mannequin in a store, they'd be like, wait, those are what? Those are Emma's jeans. You see what I'm saying here? 
[P27]  re-wear over and over and over again. I honestly love this idea and hope that it ends up happening because I think something that a lot of us are missing, especially those of us who love fashion and love to participate in fashion, is a sort of attachment to our belongings, our clothing, our accessories. Nowadays, it's about buying more by whatever means necessary, thrifting, buying online for really cheap, 
[P28]  money, whatever. And it's impossible to have any sort of attachment or appreciation for the pieces that you have when you have more than you could ever wear. Do you know what I'm saying? So I think we're going to swing in the opposite direction and it'll become cool to be seen in your iconic pair of jeans that everybody knows are your jeans. Does that make sense? Like it'll be cooler to repeat stuff. I don't know. We'll see. That might be a pipe dream. 
[P29]  Okay, next. Gaunt makeup. By gaunt makeup, I mean no blush, no highlighter, no faux freckles. I'm talking about sharp contour, otherwise sort of even complexion, right? Like you're not adding blush. You're not adding freckles. You're not adding all this stuff. Other than that, it's just like sort of flat, not dewy, but also not matte sort of face with contour. 
[P30]  Cool tones, neutral tones, but mainly cool tones. Kind of gaunt makeup. This to me is very like 90s minimalist as well. It kind of goes hand in hand with that vibe. But it also goes hand in hand with another one of my predictions. I feel like the makeup trend for the past few years has been really sweet, really warm, really youthful, really bright, 
[P31]  happy. And I think there's going to be a shift to more of a grungier sort of darker sort of look. And, you know, I'm actually not mad about this because I've been doing my makeup like this when I do my own makeup anyway for quite a while now, mainly because I think it emphasizes my personal features the best. Like, I don't think I look good when I have a lot of blush on or when I have, you know, like highlighter on my 
[P32]  little nose and in the little corners of my eye, in the little inner corner of my eye. Like, I just don't really look good like that. In my opinion, like I look better, in my opinion, with more like Tim Burton-y kind of makeup. I like that. I mean, I also like the Tim Burton movies and I grew up watching them and loving them. And it's more of like a sort of creepy sort of vibe. And I've always loved that. So, and I feel like, you know, I have the dark circles under my eyes and I have sort of big eyes. 
[P33]  kind of maybe I wish like a Tim Burton character. I can only dream that I look like a Tim Burton character, but it's like, so I like to make myself look even more like a Tim Burton character by like not covering my dark circles with concealer, by just doing like light face makeup that just exactly matches my skin tone and is like not even noticeable. It just makes it look like I just have more even complexion than I do. Contouring the face, cool toned neutrals on the eyes, 
[P34]  mascara, and then like a deep pinky brown overlined lip. And it makes my eyes look like big and scary and the dark circle looks dark. And I like it. I just, I like it. I don't know why, but I actually think it's going to be in. And I could be wrong. Cause I mean, I've been doing it for a few years now, maybe like two or three, perhaps. I don't remember. Maybe like two years now, but I think it's going to be in. And that actually leads us to indie sleaze, which is also already, 
[P35]  in, but will be even more so in, in like a big way. Indie sleaze really started to come back in 2024, but I think in 2025, it's going to reach its peak because it definitely hasn't reached its peak yet. It definitely hasn't. Let's Google what indie sleaze is so that we can all be up to date. Okay. Indie sleaze is a term that describes a style of music and fashion that was popular 
[P36]  in the United States and UK from around 2006 to 2012. The fashion was an affordable, messy, and lethargic take on vintage styles, especially from the 70s. Indy sleeves fashion is characterized by mismatched, out of proportion, and chaotic pieces. Some examples include metallic leggings, tunics, knit beanies, fedoras, and chunky costume pearls. Okay, let's fucking relax on that. I'm not... That is not what I see coming back, but I see a version of Indy sleeves coming back. 
[P37]  That means in a minute because I don't agree on all of this. The fedora is like the fedora is insane. Like that is not coming back. Knee high socks are also a key part of the indie sleaze look, whatever. A tongue in cheek style that was influenced by Brooklyn hipster fashion, 70s, 80s, electro rock music, pop art, super flat pop, whatever, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? The style grew in popularity on sites like Tumblr and MySpace and was often seen as a counterculture reaction to the economic climate of the recession. Yeah. 
[P38]  I do think that this is happening again. It's obviously not going to be exactly the same as it was in 2006 to 2012, but I think there's going to be a lot of similarities in 2025. That's my prediction. Okay. I just said the gaunt makeup, the gaunt sort of like party girl gaunt makeup, very indie sleaze to take it a step further in makeup, smudgy black eye makeup. I could see that coming, 
[P39]  back, definitely black and white stripes. To me, black and white stripes, so indie sleeves to me and I fucking love it. And to me, black and white stripes are timeless, but I think they're really going to come back and I can't wait. I'm wearing black and white stripes right now. So yeah, ripped tights, DIY cut up shirts. Like that was very indie sleeves, like cutting the sleeves off and the neck off of your own shirt and it being all like saggy and like lopsided and weird looking. The 
[P40]  Union Jack, which is the United Kingdom's flag, you know, the red, white and blue sort of star looking Union Jack. That was super indie sleaze. I think that's going to come back. I do think certain more extreme indie sleaze details will come back, potentially like a metallic legging like Google provided for me. And last but not least, I do think skinny jeans are coming back. There's been so much discourse. I can't even stay away from the discourse around 
[P41]  skinny jeans. Everybody's debating, are the skinny jeans coming back this year? Are they not? To be honest, I haven't seen anyone really wearing skinny jeans, at least in my world or in my algorithm. Like the algorithm is not feeding me videos of people wearing skinny jeans. So I haven't seen it in action yet, but I do think this year skinny jeans are back as a part of Indie Sleaze vibes. But I don't think it's what we're all afraid of. I think we're all afraid of jeggings. That's what we're all really afraid of. 
[P42]  Skinny jeans themselves, yeah, they're not great. But I think what we're really all traumatized by is like low-waisted jeggings. That was skinny jeans at their worst form in, you know, the 2010s. That's not coming back, okay? So don't worry. We're not going to be spending 10 minutes getting our super skinny, low-waisted jeggings up our legs before work or school. Like that's never happening again, right? 
[P43]  but I do think skinny jeans are going to come back. But I think that they're actually going to be less hideous than we imagine. In fact, when I think about styling skinny jeans, I'm not repulsed, which is really frightening. Because a few years ago, if you would have asked me if skinny jeans would ever come back, I would have said maybe, but like, I will never, like, I can't even imagine it. Like, it's going to be hideous. I could see it being cool. I could see it being cool. I'm definitely thinking outside the box, 
[P44]  when I'm thinking of skinny jeans looking cool, but it's not impossible. It's not impossible. And I think it will be done this year. Am I going to participate? Probably not. Although never say never, because I might get inspired and really want to do it. And I might pick up a pair, but I doubt it. And I'm going to wait as long as possible until I'm exploding and bursting at the seams and need to wear skinny jeans, which I don't think will happen. But again, never say never. I think a very specific type of skinny jean is going to come back. Real denim, like stiff, 
[P45]  real denim that's not so skin tight to the leg that it like takes two hours to get up like reasonably tight but not like impossibly tight like what was popular in the 2010s I think timeless washes right like classic denim washes nothing that's like acid wash super ripped and distressed none of that black denim I think will be fine but like 
[P46]  No extreme denim washes. And I think it might, I think it might work. I think it might work. The only thing I'm struggling with is like what shoe perhaps tucked into a boot. Oh my God. Like a skinny jean tucked into like a moto boot. Oh my God. I'm scared. Is that going to happen? Or like a skinny jean with like a little ballet flat or like a little flat shoe of some sort. Ooh, it might happen. I don't know. I could see people talking little skinny jeans into boots. I could definitely see that. 
[P47]  I don't know. We'll have to see. It might not happen, but I definitely could see the skinny jean coming back. Anyway, Indie Sleaze, I think it's back this year. It already started in 2024, so I'm not some sort of genius for predicting that, but I think it's going to hit its peak this year. Okay, next. Micro glitter matte lipstick. Okay, close your eyes and think about the early 2000s and think about the makeup trends and think about the lipstick that the beloved women in your life were wearing. 
[P48]  shimmery. It was light pink. It was micro glitters. It was like almost holographic. I think that that's coming back. You know, I was thinking about the makeup that my mom wore when I was a kid randomly the other day, like completely randomly, like I was daydreaming and that just popped into my head. And I was like, that lipstick is definitely going to come back. I just had this gut feeling. And then like a week or two later, I was watching 
[P49]  the first episode of Sex and the City for the first time, actually, because I've never watched that show. My friends were watching the first episode of Sex and the City, and I noticed that the main character was wearing that type of lipstick. And I was like, whoa, there it is again. I totally see it. Micro glitter, shimmer, matte lipstick, early 2000s lipstick vibe. Just, I don't know. I see it coming back. I see it coming back. Okay, next. 
[P50]  random. This is literally so random. Polka dots. Yeah. Polka dots. Listen, you'll notice that I'm saying a lot of timeless, classic, obvious patterns. Stripes I mentioned earlier. Polka dots I'm mentioning now. I'm going to mention stripes probably one or two more times because I think stripes are really going to be in this year. I know what you're thinking. Emma, these are the most obvious, timeless patterns. I know. But I think that that's 
[P51]  why they're going to be in this year. I think we all have such trend fatigue from keeping up with trends for the past few years. We're so exhausted with the speed of trend cycles. I think a lot of people are going to be making timeless choices this year, almost out of necessity. Like, oh my God, what can I buy that I can wear for more than six months without getting bored of it? You know? And so I think classic patterns like stripes and polka dots are going to be in. But specifically, 
[P52]  we're talking about polka dots right now. I actually, I usually get red nails when I go to the nail salon. I just always get red nails. But the last time I was there, I got little polka dots because I really do believe that polka dots are going to be stylish again. I think that they're always stylish, but I think it's going to be one of those patterns that we're not going to be able to get away from. Luckily, I think if you buy something polka dot now, you'll be able to wear it forever. 
[P53]  Because I do think that polka dots are very timeless. But I do think we might get a little bit bored of polka dots by the end of this year. I could see that happening. If they do fully come back to the extent that I think that they will. But I personally love polka dots. Like I'm actually really excited. And I don't know. I think like polka dot tights, polka dot, like a black and white polka dot jacket, like trench coat, little pops of polka dots here and there. 
[P54]  I think is going to be in. We'll see. Next, asymmetrical stuff. This is something I'm predicting because I've been seeing it pop up more and more on Pinterest. And I actually have a few asymmetrical pieces in my closet that I've collected over the years. So it definitely has been in already for the last few years, but I think it's going to be mainstream this year. I think it's going to be huge. Like everything's going to be asymmetrical. And by asymmetrical, 
[P55]  I mean, like, let's say you have a little sweater. Instead of the buttons going down the middle, the buttons are going down the left side of the sweater. Or even weird shit, like a shirt where one sleeve is long and one sleeve is short. Or a skirt where, like, the left side of the skirt is long and the right side of the skirt is, like, a foot shorter. Or a seam that goes down a weird part of the shirt. Or, like, do you see what I'm saying? Asymmetrical stuff. 
[P56]  asymmetry is going to be in. I think to take it a step further, minimalist design that is asymmetrical. So like a classic white button down, but the buttons are like on the left side. Do you see what I'm saying? That is going to be so in. Taking like minimalist design and then really just making it asymmetrical. Oh man, people are going to love that. Okay, next. Buttons are the new bows. Yeah, I think that. And I'm frightened. 
[P57]  I'm frightened because I love buttons. To me, buttons are timeless, but I think that they're going to be used as a textural element instead of as a functional element, right? Like buttons are technically used on a garment as sort of a closure mechanism, right? Buttons are used to close the garment, right? I think buttons are going to become trendy to the point where there's buttons everywhere on shit. Buttons don't even need to be there. 
[P58]  a purpose where they are. And can I be honest? I love this. And I think it's timeless. And I think it might become trendy, but I don't even care because I'm going to love that for the rest of my life. I hope it becomes trendy because then I'm going to buy up all the cool stuff. No, I'm not. I'm trying to not have a shopping addiction this year or ever again for the rest of my life. So I will not buy it up. Maybe I'll buy one special button item. But I am 
[P59]  a button tattooed on my arm. So I'm worried that it's going to become trendy to put buttons on everything and then everyone's going to start to hate buttons. And then my tattoo of a button is going to look cringe and basic. Not that there's anything wrong with being basic, but I have a button tattoo on my arm because my favorite movie is Coraline and the button is one of the main symbols of the movie. And so that's why I have a button on my arm. 
[P60]  And that's why I love buttons so much. Also, just because they're freaking cute. They're so cute. Anyway, the reason why I think buttons are the new bows, though, is because similar to a bow, like bows are absolutely timeless. A bow is a bow. It's too crucial of a design element to not be timeless. Like bows will always exist. Bows will always be in. You know what I mean? 
[P61]  will be. But I think the same thing that happened with bows will happen with buttons where we put bows on everything, right? Everybody was tying ribbon around everything. Everybody was, you know, attaching little bows to everything. Brands were coming out with stuff that just had bows all over it. There's just so many bows. It was like, oh my God, we need to stop with the bows. They're not serving a purpose. They're just here and it's stale. It became stale very quickly. 
[P62]  same thing will happen with buttons where it's like, you know, a button doing its normal button function, closing a garment will always be cool. That's timeless. But buttons being in a place just for the sake of buttons, I think might not be as timeless for majority of people. And I think majority of people will get sick of buttons in that way. Except for me, because I love buttons so much and have such a personal connection to buttons. 
[P63]  And it will never be wrong. To me, a button is never wrong. Next. So this is not necessarily like a fashion trend in the sense of like clothing or makeup or whatever. This is more of like a physical human body trend, which listen, I'm not saying that we should have body related trends. Okay. I don't think, I don't think that that's great. Right. 
[P64]  However it's the case. For the last few years, the trend has been sort of Barbie doll aesthetic. You know what I mean? Looking like a Barbie doll. Being perfectly symmetrical, having plump lips, having plump cheekbones, having the perfect little nose. Like people, you know, many, many, many, many, many, many, many people were going and, you know, getting cosmetic procedures done to accomplish this look. 
[P65]  a trend to get certain procedures done. Right. Well, I actually think that that's over. I think everyone looking the same like a little Barbie doll. I think that that's out. And listen, I'm not trying to shit on anyone who looks that way or who has, you know, chosen to go get those procedures or do whatever. Like, I get it. OK, I get it. If that's what you like or that's what you liked in the past, it's none of my business. It's up to you what you do with your face or body. 
[P66]  or whatever. I don't care. But I think it's gotten to the point now where everybody's sort of getting the same procedures done, right? Everybody's getting their lips done. A lot of people are getting rhinoplasty, he's getting their nose done. A lot of people are getting filler and Botox in the same areas, right? There's sort of become a trend of getting these certain procedures done. And what's ended up happening is a lot of people look the same. Oh my God, veneers, like getting veneers, super trendy, fake teeth that are super 
[P67]  perfect, this has become a trend, perfection, right? And now we have a lot of people who have a very similar nose and have very similar teeth and have a very similar jawline and have a very similar, you know, whatever. Listen, we're all different, but like there's definitely a lot of similarities. And so I think as a response to that, it's going to become trendy to have aesthetic quirks about your look. Now, listen, 
[P68]  In an ideal world, it would be a trend to have your own unique quirks, whatever those may be, right? So like everybody's different, meaning everybody has their own unique quirks and those are all inherently trendy. Unfortunately, that's not how our society works. I see it being like cherry picked sorts of quirks. You know what I'm saying? Like having a gap in your teeth, trendy. I could see that being trendy. I could even see people going in, 
[P69]  they don't have any quirks, going and getting quirks manufactured, going and getting a gap in your in your teeth, like going to get it grinded. Can you even do that? I don't know. Get the gap grinded down so that you have a gap in your teeth or like, you know, getting an ear implant so that your ears look unique or like getting freckles tattooed or shaving off your eyebrows. I can't explain this, but I just see a trend happening where looking 
[P70]  or quirky becomes a trend. Because the last few years, it's been trendy to all get the same procedures that make you look like a perfect Barbie doll. And I think the opposite is going to become trendy. So people who already have a gap in their teeth or already have a bunch of freckles or already have a mole on their lip or have a birthmark on their face, like these things are going to be really celebrated. And at times, 
[P71]  perhaps even manufactured. I think there's a chance that it'll become like a cosmetic procedure trend to like add quirks to your appearance. I don't know. I don't know if it's even possible. Like, could you go to a dentist and say like, I want to get a gap in my teeth like Madonna? Does she have a gap in her teeth? I think she does. Yeah. Like I want a Madonna gap in my teeth. Would the dentist do it? Probably. Um, I don't know. 
[P72]  that might be far-fetched, but I could kind of see it. Okay. Next 60s mod it's in. There's a lot of different little elements of the 1960s mod aesthetic that I think are going to come back. Some of them are going to be isolated. Like, okay. How do I explain this? Like, I don't think people are going to be like dressing up like a 1960s mod Halloween costume. Okay. 
[P73]  But I think a lot of elements of the 1960s mod aesthetic are going to come back on their own, if that makes sense. So I'm not saying this whole aesthetic is going to come back into style altogether all at once. I just think a lot of these things are going to be trendy and it's not going to be in like a in like a Halloween costume sort of way. Does that make sense? Because if you were to Google 1960s mod, you'd see a very specific sort of aesthetic, right? 
[P74]  style top in skirt, lots of color blocking, lots of classic patterns, dramatic big collars and buttons, very kitschy, very of the 1960s, right? It looks very 1960s. I don't think it's going to be that on the nose. And I don't think that like the 1960s mod aesthetic is going to come back all at once, all at the same time. Does that make sense? But there are many key elements from that era that I think are going to come back. 
[P75]  for one, the pixie haircut. The pixie haircut on women was very popular in the 60s. I think it's coming back. Now, listen, I know a lot of you are thinking, Emma, you just cut all your hair off. You got a pixie. So that's why you're saying that you think the pixie's back. But meanwhile, Emma, you look like Ellen DeGeneres. Yeah, I know. Okay. Everyone's saying I look like fucking Ellen DeGeneres since I got my little blonde pixie. All good. I still think the 
[P76]  is coming back. And I don't think I believe that just because I have a pixie and because I plan on having a pixie for the next indefinitely. Like I have no plans to grow my hair back out. I love having short hair. I think it's coming back, number one, because it's really chic, honestly. When done right, it is really chic, number one. Number two, low maintenance and easy. It is so freeing. And I think a lot of women are going to be, 
[P77]  I don't know, like if they see other women doing it, they'll feel invited to do it themselves too. Because it's really scary to go and get a pixie haircut when it's not trending. I'll tell you, it's really scary because it's a risky haircut. But if other people start doing it, I think it's going to become, I don't know, it's like a domino effect. The more people that have a pixie haircut, the more people that will feel empowered to do it themselves. And it's so cool to me and it's so comfortable and fun to style. 
[P78]  I don't know. I just think the pixie's great and I think it's going to come back. Another 1960s mod vibe, color blocking. A technique that involves wearing multiple solid colored clothing items in an outfit, often in complimentary colors. This sort of goes hand in hand with the idea of minimalist design, sort of white t-shirt, black pant, black sweater with the white, you know what I mean? Like very simple color blocking, easy on the eyes. Those two things go hand in hand in my mind. 
[P79]  I think this sort of simplicity is going to be really appealing this year, especially because I think the concept of having a lot of simple pieces and building more intricate outfits using a bunch of simple pieces is going to be really in this year because it's a more sustainable way to play with fashion, whereas constantly shopping and buying new unique pieces and making outfits with them once or twice and then donating them. Like, I just think people are going to get sick of that. 
[P80]  cadence of buying and donating and buying and donating and dealing with clutter and stuff like that. So I think the concept of color blocking is going to work really well. You know, you can wear a green t-shirt with a pair of blue pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of brown pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of orange pants. And you know what I mean? And it's, it's always, it's going to bring a different feeling every single time because it's a different combination of clothes, but that was all just with one shirt. 
[P81]  You put a little vest over that shirt. Now it feels different. It's like, I think layering and color blocking is going to be in, which is definitely very 1960s mod. Also classic patterns, stripes, polka dots, plaids, like simple timeless patterns that are always in. Very 60s mod. I think that'll be in. Simple minimalist designs are very 1960s mod. 
[P82]  just classic silhouettes that we all know and love, especially with like little skirts and dresses, timeless. And you can't go wrong. I started seeing 60s mod silhouettes on the runway like last year. And I was like, oh man, that's really going to come back in a big way. And it hasn't fully come back yet, but I think this is the year that it will. And last but not least, more modest silhouettes. I feel like the 1960s, 
[P83]  2020's aesthetic was very classy, very modest. And I could see that coming back, weirdly enough. Like a longer skirt, a boxier fit, not skin tight. I think that's going to be in. Yeah. Okay, moving on from 1960s mod, the digital watch. The digital watch. 
[P84]  analog clock. Everyone under the age of 40 prefers a digital watch, prefers a digital clock in general. None of us know how to read a clock under the age of 40. None of us. And if we do, it takes us at least five minutes to read the fucking clock. 5, 10, 15, 20. Oh, wait, what's the longhand do? It's not good. Digital watches are fucking back. You know, it was all about having like a chic wrist stack, 
[P85]  with like a beautiful Cartier watch or like a beautiful Rolex or whatever, or like a beautiful metal watch. You know, that was very trendy for a while there. Don't get me wrong. I actually do think that a lot of times those pieces of jewelry are timeless, but I think it's going to become cool to wear like a plastic Casio digital watch. In fact, I've been wearing one for the past few months, inspired by someone in my life who does wear a digital watch. Okay. 
[P86]  story, actually. This came from somebody in my life who wears a digital watch. They're the only person I know who wears a digital watch. And I remember the first day I met this person, I saw them and they were wearing a digital watch. And I remember looking at it and thinking to myself, what the fuck is going on? They're wearing a big plastic digital watch. And I was like, I have not seen somebody wear a digital watch like this who's under the age of 60. Like in, 
[P87]  Maybe ever. Like, I'm shocked by this. And as I got to know this person, I was like, hold on a minute. They're a fucking genius, to be honest. The digital watch is weatherproof. I mean, you can wear the digital, like, plasticky sort of watch anywhere. In the shower, to your workout. And a lot of times they're cheaper than the metal watches, so you're not worried about them. But more importantly, it's actually a readable watch. 
[P88]  the digital, like I just look at my wrist now that I've been wearing this rubber digital watch for the last like six months. I just look at my wrist and I know exactly what time it is. And there's no, there's no stress. And I actually think it looks cool. I did not think it looked cool at first when I saw this person wearing their digital watch the first time I met them. I, to be honest, I was like, I don't like it. I don't like that watch. What is that watch? Take that thing off. And then it grew on me and I was like, no, I actually think it's really, it's really genius. 
[P89]  myself I could see the digital watch coming back in which takes me to my next trend prediction nerd vibes remember in the 2010s when like it was all about nerds like everybody wanted to wear like suspenders and like glasses that had the white tape around the center like nerdcore I could see that coming back in in 2025 and I think the digital watch is like a great example 
[P90]  example of what that looks like. But I could see a trend of people tying tape around their glasses, like around their reading glasses. I don't think suspenders are going to come back in. I could see, I can see this now when I close my eyes. Like imagine this outfit. This is to me is like a stereotypical sort of nerd outfit. Now, by the way, the word nerd, I don't know, like stereotyping people as nerds. 
[P91]  listen, I don't know if it's politically correct, but like everyone's a nerd in a little, in a sort of way. And by nerdy, I mean like dorky, which I think is charming. Like it's not, I'm not using the word nerd in any sort of derogatory way, but there is sort of like a stereotypical sort of nerd aesthetic, right? When I close my eyes and think about what version of nerd is going to come back in 2025, I think of the glasses with the tape wrapped around the center, you know, 
[P92]  nose bridge, right? Very stereotypical nerd. I think of a sweatshirt, maybe like just like a basic sweatshirt or a funny t-shirt that's like, maybe it doesn't fit particularly well. I think of maybe like a utilitarian pant of sorts, like a cargo pant, perhaps a cargo short, you know, things that are considered not necessarily fashionable or not necessarily 
[P93]  chic, right? Perhaps like a sort of narrow fitting shoe, like a small narrow fitting shoe, like a little sneaker that's sort of a bit nerdy, like almost like a little Merrill or like a little Keen or like a little like Adidas that's sort of narrow, like, I don't know, like a narrow, small sneaker. That's the kind of nerd that I'm imagining. And I think that that's going to be really in this year. 
[P94]  Almost like how everybody became obsessed with, like, Adam Sandler's street style. Because he would just wear, like, a dumpy pair of, like, basketball shorts and, like, an oversized T-shirt and, like, sneakers. And he just looked kind of like a mess. But everybody loved it. And I think that that's going to be back. Where it's, like, nerdy, like, computer lover vibes. Like, early 2000s nerd vibes. I see that coming back. Okay, next. Okay, hear me out. Clogs. 
[P95]  Clogs are so bad. I keep seeing people wearing clogs. Like I'm starting to see it happen. And I think 2025 is the year of the clog, which leads me to a broader prediction I have, which is sort of like gardening chef core. Okay. Now I'm not talking about cutesy little gardening, cutesy little chef. Like I actually weirdly imagine people taking inspiration from what chefs actually, 
[P96]  wear or like what you really wear gardening. You know what I'm saying? Like the utilitarian gardening gloves. OK, a utilitarian chef's waist apron. I could see these things becoming fashionable. And I think it's going to go hand in hand with, you know, gardening and cooking becoming trendy as an activity this year. But I really could see like I'm looking up gardening outfit on 
[P97]  Google gardening outfit. Let's see what comes up. Okay. Yeah. Like apron. I could weirdly see aprons like, okay, obviously not like a literal kitchen apron or a literal gardening apron, but like little waist aprons, honestly kind of useful too. Like I would wear that if, if I saw like in a thrift store or something, like a cute little waist belt apron, I would totally buy that and wear that like over jeans, honestly cute. I'm seeing some 
[P98]  overalls. I don't know. I don't know the overalls are going to be in perhaps. I mean, it's part of the gardening aesthetic. Let me look up chef outfit. Yeah. Like I'm looking at chef outfits. It's very often the, the double button sort of jacket, right. Or shirt that could come in. Like, I don't know. I feel like gardening in chef aesthetic is going to be in. I mean, listen, do I think people are going to be wearing like a large 
[P99]  white chef's hat? No, but I don't know. Listen, this is how I feel and it could be totally off base, but I just, I don't know. That's what my gut is telling me. Clogs, aprons, utilitarian gardener, utilitarian chef, you know? Ah, fuck. I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Last but not least, nautical vibes. Okay. The ocean, the sea, fishermen, the whole thing. And this, 
[P100]  This has been rumbling under the surface for a while now. In fact, this honestly goes hand in hand with my boat shoe prediction, right? But I think it's going to expand. It's going to expand in 2025 and more nautical fishermen elements are going to become trendy. One very specific example, yellow raincoat and yellow rain boots. Mark my words. 
[P101]  very nautical fishermen outdoorsy, okay? This is something that I want. Honestly, if this becomes trendy and brands start making yellow raincoats and yellow rain boots, I will be buying a pair of each because I'm really into this trend. I think, again, like a lot of the things that I've mentioned today are super classic and timeless. Stripes, minimalist design, 
[P102]  boots. Like those are classic pieces, right? But I think that all of these classic pieces are going to come back because of trend fatigue, right? This isn't a coincidence that a lot of these things are really classic. A yellow raincoat and yellow rain boot, it doesn't get more classic than that. Not only does it fall under the sort of nautical category, which I think is coming back anyway, but it's also timeless. I'm super into it. This is actually one of the few things that I personally will 
[P103]  be buying if I see a version of it that appeals to me because it really excites me. And if this prediction is true or even if it's not, I'm probably going to get my hands on it anyway because I really want a yellow pair of rain boots and I really want a yellow raincoat. It just is cute and I just want it. But jumping off of that, I think perhaps a pop of yellow could be the new pop of red. Last year, it was all about the pop of red. I could see a pop of yellow becoming the new pop of red. That's just a brief side note. It doesn't really have anything to do 
[P104]  with nautical, but I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Back to nautical. Blue and white stripes. Okay. I think stripes are going to be all the rage. I think they're going to be all the rage in a bazillion different ways. Like the black and white stripe, indie sleaze. Blue and white stripe, nautical aesthetic. Okay. Red and white stripe, nautical aesthetic. I think a nautical stripe is going to be really in, which I absolutely love. 
[P105]  classic cable knit sweaters, like thick, chunky, high quality looking, simple, one color, neutral colors, cable knit sweater, like a cream cable knit sweater, a blue cable knit sweater, not neon, not bright, muted, muted colors, muted colors, cable knit sweater, very fisherman looking, very vintage looking, but not vintage in like an eighties way. No, 
[P106]  Oh, classic, classic, simple, neutral cable knit sweater. Thick knit, thick, thick yarn. Not thin, not flimsy, thick, boxy, fisherman cable knit sweater. Little fisherman's hats, okay? Like a little tight little beanie or like a little tight little cap that has no bill at the front. Like it's just a little fisherman's cap, a little, do you know what those are? Like a little cap? Cap? 
[P107]  with no front bill. What is that called? Great. I found it. Yeah. It's a no brim hat, a pillock's hat. Is that what it's called? Pillock's. Watch that be like some sort of like really rude derogatory term. I always get, no, it's not called a pillock's. Oh, is it pillbox or pillock's? This is not what I'm looking for. This is wrong. It's a no brim hat, brimless hat. 
[P108]  those are in. I actually almost bought a brimless hat like six months ago. I didn't end up buying it because the material was a little bit too cheap for my liking, but I've had my eye on those for a while now and I think they're going to be in. And last but not least, in the world of nautical fashion, this is not very fisherman aesthetic. This is not very, it's not even that nautical, like it is nautical, but it's like, it's a bit more elevated 
[P109]  it? Pearls. I think pearls are in. Like a little pearl necklace. I don't know. I feel like pearls haven't been in for a while. And I could see pearls having a moment this year. Like a chic, classic pearl. I don't know. I could see it happening. Okay. That is what I think is going to be in in 2025. If I literally get one of those predictions correct, I will be so stoked. I mean, the truth of the matter is, 
[P110]  lot of those predictions aren't even fully predictions because a lot of them are already starting to pop up now or like they already were popping up last year, but maybe they just weren't mainstream yet. And I think they're going to go mainstream this year. And then some things were more random, but we shall see. Here's what I think is going to go out of style in 2025. These are the things that I predict are really going to go out. 
[P111]  of style in 2025. Number one, every single niche in aesthetic and core that happened in 2024, every single one. We really, really had a quick trend cycle last year. And I think every single thing that we experimented with last year is just absolutely over this year. Every trend that popped up last year, we wore to death. 
[P112]  thing. Like very few things from last year that were big are going to make it to this year. I think most of them are going to die in 2024. Next, dressing exactly like another era on the nose. Okay. Almost like period dressing, not like period dressing, like, oh, I'm about to have my period. So I'm wearing black pants so that I don't stain my pants. I mean, like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I don't even know what the term for that would be, but you get the idea. Over the last few years, 
[P113]  There's been moments where it's been trendy to dress exactly like a certain era on the nose. OK, like Y2K on the nose. That was really trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 90s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing really 70s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 80s on the nose. This is all within the last five years. OK, at any point in time over the last five years, 
[P114]  there's been a trend of dressing like a certain era, whether it's Y2K or 90s or 80s or 70s or 60s. Actually, not really 60s as much, but do you get what I'm saying? Like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I think that that's out completely. And I know that I mentioned 90s minimalism and I know that I mentioned 60s mod as being in, but I more mean elements from those time periods. I don't mean like dressing exactly 
[P115]  like that time period. I think that dressing exactly like a certain time period, it always sort of feels costume-esque, which is not timeless. Mixing and matching various references from various decades and making something kind of new and kind of your own, I think that's probably better. And I think that that's going to be what people are doing in 2025. I think it's going to look costumey to 
[P116]  dress exactly Y2K, exactly 90s, exactly 70s. You know what I mean? Even exactly 60s mod, even though I think a lot of elements of the 60s mod are going to be in. I think if you dress up like you're somebody in the 60s mod era, it's going to look costumey. And I think that that's not going to fly in 2025. Next camo. Camo is so done. It's done. Unless you're literally like a deer hunter, 
[P117]  or you're in the army. Like, no, if you're just, if you're like, like a little fashion kid in New York wearing the camo, I think that might be out. I think that might be out. I think that pattern is out. I'm sorry. I never loved it, which is, by the way, if you love camo, I'm not even kidding. If you love camo still, by all means, wear camo. Okay. It's none of my business, but I think it's out. It got really big in 2024. And I think, 
[P118]  It's going to be out. Next, the whole soccer jersey trend, like it was such a trend to wear like international soccer jerseys. That is out. Everybody give your Argentinian soccer jersey for a team that you don't know back to your little brother who actually cares about the team. Do you know what I'm saying? Like it's done. We're not wearing those jerseys anymore unless it's genuine. If you genuinely love a certain soccer team 
[P119]  them and whatever like that's different but there was a lot of people buying soccer jerseys and other sort of similar jerseys for the sake of fashion or stealing them from their little brothers give it back you know find somebody who you know who actually likes the team and give it to them just it's it's over uh and last but not least don't get mad at me for this designer dupes there's a big trend of buying designer dupes 
[P120]  last year, which I don't think is necessarily bad. If you really love something and you can find a dupe, I'm not going to judge you. You know, that's not, it's not about like moral righteousness. I'm not saying like designer dupes are out for 2025 because they're wrong. I am not the moral police here. Okay. I think it's out because I think people are going to choose to spend that money on something unique instead. Does that make sense? 
[P121]  Like instead of buying a dupe of something, why not take that money and buy something that just costs that much? You know, that's from like a cool, small little brand that you found online or at like a flea market or something. You know what I mean? I just think designer dupes are out because I think things that are explicitly designer are out. I think if you listen to my last episode about what I think is in and out for 2025, I talked a lot about how I think flexing and extravagance and showing off wealth. 
[P122]  all of this is out. And so I think as a result, you know, designer, like buying a designer dupe is out. Like, I just don't think people are going to be wasting their money on buying a dupe or something. Like, who cares? You know, like wearing designer things that are clearly designer aren't as, I think a bit of the excitement around that is gone. There are probably so many more trend predictions that I could come up with and so many things that I think are out, but that's all I have for right now. 
[P123]  have to cut myself off or else I'll talk for nine hours. And if I keep going, I'll also just list every single possible possibility, which also makes it less fun. It's like if I just, if I predict every single possible thing, like I think the 70s are going to be in and the 80s and the 90s and the 2000s. I think they're all going to be in. Then if I get one right, it doesn't matter because I actually listed every single possible thing that could ever possibly happen. So we're going to stop here. 
[P124]  you all for listening and hanging out. I hope that you enjoyed this episode. If I said something rude about something that you like, literally allow that to strengthen your love for that particular item, right? If I came on here and said, I hate camo, I did say that. If me saying I hate camo upsets you because you love camo, allow that to further strengthen your love for camo. Say, 
[P125]  know what? When Emma said she hated camo, it made me so mad because I love camo and Emma doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about. Great. Great. Wear whatever the fuck you want. Pay attention to the trend cycles. Ignore the trend cycles. Do whatever you want to do. Okay. Fashion is about you. Use fashion as a tool that benefits you. And it's not that deep. I love talking about it though. Oh my God. I love talking about fashion, but it's not that deep, but we'll see what happens. We'll see if I get anything 
[P126]  right. I really, really think the yellow raincoat, I keep almost calling it a rain coot. It's very weird. Uh, I really do think that the yellow raincoat and the yellow rain boots are going to come back that I have the same feeling about that, that I had about the boat shoes. Like it was almost like, uh, it was like God came down and told me. So we'll see. Anywho, that's all I have to say. Thank you all for listening and hanging out. It's always a pleasure. If you enjoyed it, come back. 
[P127]  every Thursday and Sunday and hang out. Anything Goes is anywhere that you stream podcasts and also on YouTube. So come hang out on YouTube now. It's pretty awesome. Check out Anything Goes on social media at Anything Goes. Check out me on social media at Emma Chamberlain and check out my coffee company at chamberlaincoffee.com and at Chamberlain Coffee on social media. That's all I got. Thank you all for listening and hanging out. I love you. I love you. I love you. And I'll talk to you soon. And bye.

输入：
[P1] ﻿ About a year ago, I predicted the boat shoe trend. Yeah, I did. And can I be honest? Since then, I've been chasing that feeling. The feeling of predicting a trend and then seeing it in the real world, I imagine rivals the feeling of seeing your newborn baby for the first time. Like, I think I'll probably feel that excited again on the day that I give birth to my first child. That's the next time I'll feel that level of satisfaction, unless, 
[P2]  I'm able to successfully predict another trend before that, which is what I'm going to try to do today. Today, I am going to share with you my 2025 fashion trend predictions. If I can get even one of these right, I'll be able to match that feeling I got when I predicted the boat shoe coming back. But I'm being realistic here. I don't have a crystal ball. Some of these predictions are random gut feelings. 
[P3]  are based on what I've studied sort of starting to become popular over the past few years, but haven't fully gone mainstream yet. And I predict that this year they will go mainstream. So it's a combination of gut feelings and educated guesses. The educated guesses are less satisfying if they come true because it's like I saw it coming in the world, right? The gut feelings, those, if they come true, 
[P4]  more rewarding. So hopefully, well, whatever. I'll just be happy if I get anything right. So let's begin. 2025 fashion trend predictions. I briefly paused this episode of Anything Goes to let you know that this episode of Anything Goes is presented by Amazon. Getting sick is horrible enough. The getting better part shouldn't be horrible too. Waiting on hold for an appointment, sitting in crowded waiting rooms, 
[P5]  That's almost as bad as the sickness itself. Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy remove these painful parts of getting better with things like 24-7 virtual visits and prescriptions delivered to your door. Thanks to Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy for sponsoring today's episode. Now let's get back to the episode. We're starting out with the obvious. I've been talking about this for a while now, so this shouldn't be a shock to anyone. Minimalism. 
[P6]  a lifestyle perspective. I'm not talking about owning less clothes. I'm talking about minimalistic design, okay? Now, what is that, you may ask? Don't worry. I Googled it for you, and I have the definition right here. Minimalism is a style that prioritizes simplicity, clean lines, neutral colors, and timeless silhouettes, focusing on quality over quantity and emphasizing essential, versatile pieces rather than trendy, 
[P7]  clothing. Now, I've been talking about minimalism coming back for so long. I'm sick of talking about it, too. OK, so I won't overemphasize this point, but I think minimalism in one way or another is always in. I don't know. I even feel like the clean girl aesthetic of 2023, 2024 was kind of minimalist in a way because it was a sort of style that consisted of simplicity and clean 
[P8]  and neutral colors and timeless silhouettes. So, you know, when I say that minimalism is coming back, what comes to my mind is like 90s minimalism. Let's Google 90s minimalism. Okay, if you Google 90s minimalism, this is what comes up. I'm looking on British Vogue at an article called The Minimalist 90s Outfits Inspiring My Summer Wardrobe, just to give some examples of some minimalist outfits. 
[P9]  I see a plain white t-shirt with some simple pinstripe dress pants and a matching pinstripe dressy little vest. I see classic blue jeans. I see classic black boots. A lot of simple tank tops, t-shirts in neutral colors. Lots of black and white button down shirts. 
[P10]  simple dress pants or capris, classic just suit jackets, blazers, simple dresses that aren't super tight in neutral colors, lots of black boots, lots of plain, simple, flat loafers, black, white, brown. I mean, yeah, it's just, it's like, it's very, it's simple, but it does still have swag. And the swag element is what's really 
[P11]  really hard to put a finger on. Somehow 90s minimalism, when you Google it, it doesn't look boring. There's magic happening with it somehow. I don't know. I see 90s minimalism really being the main trend this year. And here's the thing. The truth of the matter is minimalism in clothing design is timeless. Like a white button down, a pair of blue jeans, a pair of black slacks, a pair of little simple black loafers, a black boot. 
[P12]  a white t-shirt. These things are never out. They are always in. So a lot of people I've seen online saying like, minimalism is just another trend. It's not preventing people from buying more stuff. People are going to buy minimalist design. And then when that's out, they're going to go and they're going to buy maximalist design again. Minimalist stuff is just as trendy as maximalist stuff. I actually disagree. There's kind of a debate happening on the internet around 
[P13]  whether or not minimalist designs are timeless, whether or not they come in and out of style. I definitely do think they have trendy moments, but I think unlike maximalist designs, they're always in and no one can change my mind. Okay. I think minimalist design is really going to be in, in 2025, but it's never going to be out because it's too simple to ever be in or out. You know what I'm saying? If you were doing sort of the clean girl aesthetic, 
[P14]  2024, 2023, 2024, which consisted of, you know, the slick back bun, the trench coats, the dress pants, the little loafers, the little button up shirts. It's just very like chic and classy. Literally, just by styling that slightly different, maybe doing your hair a little bit different, maybe accessorizing a little bit differently, you now have 90s minimalism, right? And then in a few years when there's a new sort of minimalist style that's in, you can, 
[P15]  reuse those pieces again. I just, I really do think when it comes to trends, any sort of minimalist trend to me is the safest one to buy into because you actually can reuse those pieces in a million different ways. So I think investing in good minimalist pieces, I would be shocked if you regretted it, you know, unless you're just a maximalist at heart and you don't like clothes like that. Fair enough. 
[P16]  buy, you know, good basics and stuff. Like I think that's going to be really in and styling them in unique ways that have sort of magic. I think that's going to be in, but I don't think it's something we're ever going to look back at and cringe at, which is cool. It's cool when a trend also is timeless and it's rare. So I think this is one of the rare times when something timeless will be trendy. Moving on. Okay. So in 2024, the concept of 
[P17]  Jane Birkening your bag. Are we remembering this? This is the concept of taking your purse and attaching a bunch of personalized objects onto it, tying a bandana onto it, putting little charms on it, attaching jewelry to it, inspired by Jane Birken of the 60s, who carried around her iconic Birken bag that she attached a bunch of little accessories to that were personal to her. 
[P18]  and then gets a bit warm and then ties it around her purse to give her neck some air. That's the idea, right? Organically and authentically accessorizing her purse through necessity and convenience, weirdly enough, became a trend in 2024 where everybody was buying charms and finding bandanas and things in their drawers and then adding it to their bag to make it look authentic like Jane Birkin's bag. Fascinating trend. 
[P19]  think it's ending in 2025. I think it's going to expand in 2025. In 2024, it was all about the bag, right? Accessorizing the bag in that way. I think in 2025, it's about doing that with everything, okay? Your favorite hat, put a bunch of pins on it. Embroider a heart into it. Put a patch on it. On your jacket, there's a rip. You sew it with contrasting thread. Let's say it's a black jacket. You fix the 
[P20]  the rip with white thick thread, you know, you put pins on it, you put patches on it, your favorite pair of jeans, you put little accessories on the belt loops. You again, put patches, sew up the holes with bright thread, you know, paint your name onto the pocket, like accessorize, accessorize, accessorize with shoes, paint on your shoes. Like you get what I'm saying? Like making your pieces, 
[P21]  really, really unique to you. Because I think that what's going on right now is that a lot of people are craving a sense of personal style. And I've seen a lot of discourse around personal style and how personal style is sort of dead because of the internet. Whether or not that's true, that's a conversation for another day. But I think this idea of personalization is going to give people the feeling of personal style. Because 
[P22]  you can have the same pair of jeans as somebody else. In fact, you probably do. What sets you apart is how you personalize them. What sets them apart is that it's the pair that is your favorite that you wear three days a week. You know, this idea of really personalizing your items and having less items as well. Because I think prior to recently, it's been all about having a lot of stuff, having a lot of clothes, especially if you're into fashion, having as many options as possible so that you can constantly 
[P23]  be wearing a new outfit. That was sort of trendy, right? For many years to always be wearing a new outfit, to never wear the same outfit twice. I think that that's out. And I think having signature pieces that are super personalized that you wear over and over and over again and you style a multitude of ways, I think that's in. I even thought about it in terms of the Stanley Cup, which is not really a fashionable thing. That's more of like a pop culture obsession. 
[P24]  a Stanley Cup. I have a Stanley Cup. But I even thought about it like this. Like, this is almost a metaphor for what I mean for fashion in like clothing and stuff. It's the idea of like, instead of having every single color of Stanley Cup, instead of having the bright pink one and the blue one and the sparkly white one and the brown one and the orange one and the green one, you just have one that's your favorite color and you put stickers on it. You take your watch 
[P25]  the middle of the day and you attach it to your Stanley cup and you, it's like truly a utilitarian, like fully functional item. And it is your personal favorite item. It becomes a special thing to you. If you only have one and the one that you do have, you use every day or very consistently. And it looks like you, it becomes your iconic Stanley cup. That I think is going to be cool. That's going to be the way that we 
[P26]  consume, I think, in 2025. Instead of having nine pairs of jeans, you have two and they're both really special. And they're known as like, oh, those are Emma's jeans. Like if somebody were to see your signature pair of jeans on a mannequin in a store, they'd be like, wait, those are what? Those are Emma's jeans. You see what I'm saying here? 
[P27]  re-wear over and over and over again. I honestly love this idea and hope that it ends up happening because I think something that a lot of us are missing, especially those of us who love fashion and love to participate in fashion, is a sort of attachment to our belongings, our clothing, our accessories. Nowadays, it's about buying more by whatever means necessary, thrifting, buying online for really cheap, 
[P28]  money, whatever. And it's impossible to have any sort of attachment or appreciation for the pieces that you have when you have more than you could ever wear. Do you know what I'm saying? So I think we're going to swing in the opposite direction and it'll become cool to be seen in your iconic pair of jeans that everybody knows are your jeans. Does that make sense? Like it'll be cooler to repeat stuff. I don't know. We'll see. That might be a pipe dream. 
[P29]  Okay, next. Gaunt makeup. By gaunt makeup, I mean no blush, no highlighter, no faux freckles. I'm talking about sharp contour, otherwise sort of even complexion, right? Like you're not adding blush. You're not adding freckles. You're not adding all this stuff. Other than that, it's just like sort of flat, not dewy, but also not matte sort of face with contour. 
[P30]  Cool tones, neutral tones, but mainly cool tones. Kind of gaunt makeup. This to me is very like 90s minimalist as well. It kind of goes hand in hand with that vibe. But it also goes hand in hand with another one of my predictions. I feel like the makeup trend for the past few years has been really sweet, really warm, really youthful, really bright, 
[P31]  happy. And I think there's going to be a shift to more of a grungier sort of darker sort of look. And, you know, I'm actually not mad about this because I've been doing my makeup like this when I do my own makeup anyway for quite a while now, mainly because I think it emphasizes my personal features the best. Like, I don't think I look good when I have a lot of blush on or when I have, you know, like highlighter on my 
[P32]  little nose and in the little corners of my eye, in the little inner corner of my eye. Like, I just don't really look good like that. In my opinion, like I look better, in my opinion, with more like Tim Burton-y kind of makeup. I like that. I mean, I also like the Tim Burton movies and I grew up watching them and loving them. And it's more of like a sort of creepy sort of vibe. And I've always loved that. So, and I feel like, you know, I have the dark circles under my eyes and I have sort of big eyes. 
[P33]  kind of maybe I wish like a Tim Burton character. I can only dream that I look like a Tim Burton character, but it's like, so I like to make myself look even more like a Tim Burton character by like not covering my dark circles with concealer, by just doing like light face makeup that just exactly matches my skin tone and is like not even noticeable. It just makes it look like I just have more even complexion than I do. Contouring the face, cool toned neutrals on the eyes, 
[P34]  mascara, and then like a deep pinky brown overlined lip. And it makes my eyes look like big and scary and the dark circle looks dark. And I like it. I just, I like it. I don't know why, but I actually think it's going to be in. And I could be wrong. Cause I mean, I've been doing it for a few years now, maybe like two or three, perhaps. I don't remember. Maybe like two years now, but I think it's going to be in. And that actually leads us to indie sleaze, which is also already, 
[P35]  in, but will be even more so in, in like a big way. Indie sleaze really started to come back in 2024, but I think in 2025, it's going to reach its peak because it definitely hasn't reached its peak yet. It definitely hasn't. Let's Google what indie sleaze is so that we can all be up to date. Okay. Indie sleaze is a term that describes a style of music and fashion that was popular 
[P36]  in the United States and UK from around 2006 to 2012. The fashion was an affordable, messy, and lethargic take on vintage styles, especially from the 70s. Indy sleeves fashion is characterized by mismatched, out of proportion, and chaotic pieces. Some examples include metallic leggings, tunics, knit beanies, fedoras, and chunky costume pearls. Okay, let's fucking relax on that. I'm not... That is not what I see coming back, but I see a version of Indy sleeves coming back. 
[P37]  That means in a minute because I don't agree on all of this. The fedora is like the fedora is insane. Like that is not coming back. Knee high socks are also a key part of the indie sleaze look, whatever. A tongue in cheek style that was influenced by Brooklyn hipster fashion, 70s, 80s, electro rock music, pop art, super flat pop, whatever, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? The style grew in popularity on sites like Tumblr and MySpace and was often seen as a counterculture reaction to the economic climate of the recession. Yeah. 
[P38]  I do think that this is happening again. It's obviously not going to be exactly the same as it was in 2006 to 2012, but I think there's going to be a lot of similarities in 2025. That's my prediction. Okay. I just said the gaunt makeup, the gaunt sort of like party girl gaunt makeup, very indie sleaze to take it a step further in makeup, smudgy black eye makeup. I could see that coming, 
[P39]  back, definitely black and white stripes. To me, black and white stripes, so indie sleeves to me and I fucking love it. And to me, black and white stripes are timeless, but I think they're really going to come back and I can't wait. I'm wearing black and white stripes right now. So yeah, ripped tights, DIY cut up shirts. Like that was very indie sleeves, like cutting the sleeves off and the neck off of your own shirt and it being all like saggy and like lopsided and weird looking. The 
[P40]  Union Jack, which is the United Kingdom's flag, you know, the red, white and blue sort of star looking Union Jack. That was super indie sleaze. I think that's going to come back. I do think certain more extreme indie sleaze details will come back, potentially like a metallic legging like Google provided for me. And last but not least, I do think skinny jeans are coming back. There's been so much discourse. I can't even stay away from the discourse around 
[P41]  skinny jeans. Everybody's debating, are the skinny jeans coming back this year? Are they not? To be honest, I haven't seen anyone really wearing skinny jeans, at least in my world or in my algorithm. Like the algorithm is not feeding me videos of people wearing skinny jeans. So I haven't seen it in action yet, but I do think this year skinny jeans are back as a part of Indie Sleaze vibes. But I don't think it's what we're all afraid of. I think we're all afraid of jeggings. That's what we're all really afraid of. 
[P42]  Skinny jeans themselves, yeah, they're not great. But I think what we're really all traumatized by is like low-waisted jeggings. That was skinny jeans at their worst form in, you know, the 2010s. That's not coming back, okay? So don't worry. We're not going to be spending 10 minutes getting our super skinny, low-waisted jeggings up our legs before work or school. Like that's never happening again, right? 
[P43]  but I do think skinny jeans are going to come back. But I think that they're actually going to be less hideous than we imagine. In fact, when I think about styling skinny jeans, I'm not repulsed, which is really frightening. Because a few years ago, if you would have asked me if skinny jeans would ever come back, I would have said maybe, but like, I will never, like, I can't even imagine it. Like, it's going to be hideous. I could see it being cool. I could see it being cool. I'm definitely thinking outside the box, 
[P44]  when I'm thinking of skinny jeans looking cool, but it's not impossible. It's not impossible. And I think it will be done this year. Am I going to participate? Probably not. Although never say never, because I might get inspired and really want to do it. And I might pick up a pair, but I doubt it. And I'm going to wait as long as possible until I'm exploding and bursting at the seams and need to wear skinny jeans, which I don't think will happen. But again, never say never. I think a very specific type of skinny jean is going to come back. Real denim, like stiff, 
[P45]  real denim that's not so skin tight to the leg that it like takes two hours to get up like reasonably tight but not like impossibly tight like what was popular in the 2010s I think timeless washes right like classic denim washes nothing that's like acid wash super ripped and distressed none of that black denim I think will be fine but like 
[P46]  No extreme denim washes. And I think it might, I think it might work. I think it might work. The only thing I'm struggling with is like what shoe perhaps tucked into a boot. Oh my God. Like a skinny jean tucked into like a moto boot. Oh my God. I'm scared. Is that going to happen? Or like a skinny jean with like a little ballet flat or like a little flat shoe of some sort. Ooh, it might happen. I don't know. I could see people talking little skinny jeans into boots. I could definitely see that. 
[P47]  I don't know. We'll have to see. It might not happen, but I definitely could see the skinny jean coming back. Anyway, Indie Sleaze, I think it's back this year. It already started in 2024, so I'm not some sort of genius for predicting that, but I think it's going to hit its peak this year. Okay, next. Micro glitter matte lipstick. Okay, close your eyes and think about the early 2000s and think about the makeup trends and think about the lipstick that the beloved women in your life were wearing. 
[P48]  shimmery. It was light pink. It was micro glitters. It was like almost holographic. I think that that's coming back. You know, I was thinking about the makeup that my mom wore when I was a kid randomly the other day, like completely randomly, like I was daydreaming and that just popped into my head. And I was like, that lipstick is definitely going to come back. I just had this gut feeling. And then like a week or two later, I was watching 
[P49]  the first episode of Sex and the City for the first time, actually, because I've never watched that show. My friends were watching the first episode of Sex and the City, and I noticed that the main character was wearing that type of lipstick. And I was like, whoa, there it is again. I totally see it. Micro glitter, shimmer, matte lipstick, early 2000s lipstick vibe. Just, I don't know. I see it coming back. I see it coming back. Okay, next. 
[P50]  random. This is literally so random. Polka dots. Yeah. Polka dots. Listen, you'll notice that I'm saying a lot of timeless, classic, obvious patterns. Stripes I mentioned earlier. Polka dots I'm mentioning now. I'm going to mention stripes probably one or two more times because I think stripes are really going to be in this year. I know what you're thinking. Emma, these are the most obvious, timeless patterns. I know. But I think that that's 
[P51]  why they're going to be in this year. I think we all have such trend fatigue from keeping up with trends for the past few years. We're so exhausted with the speed of trend cycles. I think a lot of people are going to be making timeless choices this year, almost out of necessity. Like, oh my God, what can I buy that I can wear for more than six months without getting bored of it? You know? And so I think classic patterns like stripes and polka dots are going to be in. But specifically, 
[P52]  we're talking about polka dots right now. I actually, I usually get red nails when I go to the nail salon. I just always get red nails. But the last time I was there, I got little polka dots because I really do believe that polka dots are going to be stylish again. I think that they're always stylish, but I think it's going to be one of those patterns that we're not going to be able to get away from. Luckily, I think if you buy something polka dot now, you'll be able to wear it forever. 
[P53]  Because I do think that polka dots are very timeless. But I do think we might get a little bit bored of polka dots by the end of this year. I could see that happening. If they do fully come back to the extent that I think that they will. But I personally love polka dots. Like I'm actually really excited. And I don't know. I think like polka dot tights, polka dot, like a black and white polka dot jacket, like trench coat, little pops of polka dots here and there. 
[P54]  I think is going to be in. We'll see. Next, asymmetrical stuff. This is something I'm predicting because I've been seeing it pop up more and more on Pinterest. And I actually have a few asymmetrical pieces in my closet that I've collected over the years. So it definitely has been in already for the last few years, but I think it's going to be mainstream this year. I think it's going to be huge. Like everything's going to be asymmetrical. And by asymmetrical, 
[P55]  I mean, like, let's say you have a little sweater. Instead of the buttons going down the middle, the buttons are going down the left side of the sweater. Or even weird shit, like a shirt where one sleeve is long and one sleeve is short. Or a skirt where, like, the left side of the skirt is long and the right side of the skirt is, like, a foot shorter. Or a seam that goes down a weird part of the shirt. Or, like, do you see what I'm saying? Asymmetrical stuff. 
[P56]  asymmetry is going to be in. I think to take it a step further, minimalist design that is asymmetrical. So like a classic white button down, but the buttons are like on the left side. Do you see what I'm saying? That is going to be so in. Taking like minimalist design and then really just making it asymmetrical. Oh man, people are going to love that. Okay, next. Buttons are the new bows. Yeah, I think that. And I'm frightened. 
[P57]  I'm frightened because I love buttons. To me, buttons are timeless, but I think that they're going to be used as a textural element instead of as a functional element, right? Like buttons are technically used on a garment as sort of a closure mechanism, right? Buttons are used to close the garment, right? I think buttons are going to become trendy to the point where there's buttons everywhere on shit. Buttons don't even need to be there. 
[P58]  a purpose where they are. And can I be honest? I love this. And I think it's timeless. And I think it might become trendy, but I don't even care because I'm going to love that for the rest of my life. I hope it becomes trendy because then I'm going to buy up all the cool stuff. No, I'm not. I'm trying to not have a shopping addiction this year or ever again for the rest of my life. So I will not buy it up. Maybe I'll buy one special button item. But I am 
[P59]  a button tattooed on my arm. So I'm worried that it's going to become trendy to put buttons on everything and then everyone's going to start to hate buttons. And then my tattoo of a button is going to look cringe and basic. Not that there's anything wrong with being basic, but I have a button tattoo on my arm because my favorite movie is Coraline and the button is one of the main symbols of the movie. And so that's why I have a button on my arm. 
[P60]  And that's why I love buttons so much. Also, just because they're freaking cute. They're so cute. Anyway, the reason why I think buttons are the new bows, though, is because similar to a bow, like bows are absolutely timeless. A bow is a bow. It's too crucial of a design element to not be timeless. Like bows will always exist. Bows will always be in. You know what I mean? 
[P61]  will be. But I think the same thing that happened with bows will happen with buttons where we put bows on everything, right? Everybody was tying ribbon around everything. Everybody was, you know, attaching little bows to everything. Brands were coming out with stuff that just had bows all over it. There's just so many bows. It was like, oh my God, we need to stop with the bows. They're not serving a purpose. They're just here and it's stale. It became stale very quickly. 
[P62]  same thing will happen with buttons where it's like, you know, a button doing its normal button function, closing a garment will always be cool. That's timeless. But buttons being in a place just for the sake of buttons, I think might not be as timeless for majority of people. And I think majority of people will get sick of buttons in that way. Except for me, because I love buttons so much and have such a personal connection to buttons. 
[P63]  And it will never be wrong. To me, a button is never wrong. Next. So this is not necessarily like a fashion trend in the sense of like clothing or makeup or whatever. This is more of like a physical human body trend, which listen, I'm not saying that we should have body related trends. Okay. I don't think, I don't think that that's great. Right. 
[P64]  However it's the case. For the last few years, the trend has been sort of Barbie doll aesthetic. You know what I mean? Looking like a Barbie doll. Being perfectly symmetrical, having plump lips, having plump cheekbones, having the perfect little nose. Like people, you know, many, many, many, many, many, many, many people were going and, you know, getting cosmetic procedures done to accomplish this look. 
[P65]  a trend to get certain procedures done. Right. Well, I actually think that that's over. I think everyone looking the same like a little Barbie doll. I think that that's out. And listen, I'm not trying to shit on anyone who looks that way or who has, you know, chosen to go get those procedures or do whatever. Like, I get it. OK, I get it. If that's what you like or that's what you liked in the past, it's none of my business. It's up to you what you do with your face or body. 
[P66]  or whatever. I don't care. But I think it's gotten to the point now where everybody's sort of getting the same procedures done, right? Everybody's getting their lips done. A lot of people are getting rhinoplasty, he's getting their nose done. A lot of people are getting filler and Botox in the same areas, right? There's sort of become a trend of getting these certain procedures done. And what's ended up happening is a lot of people look the same. Oh my God, veneers, like getting veneers, super trendy, fake teeth that are super 
[P67]  perfect, this has become a trend, perfection, right? And now we have a lot of people who have a very similar nose and have very similar teeth and have a very similar jawline and have a very similar, you know, whatever. Listen, we're all different, but like there's definitely a lot of similarities. And so I think as a response to that, it's going to become trendy to have aesthetic quirks about your look. Now, listen, 
[P68]  In an ideal world, it would be a trend to have your own unique quirks, whatever those may be, right? So like everybody's different, meaning everybody has their own unique quirks and those are all inherently trendy. Unfortunately, that's not how our society works. I see it being like cherry picked sorts of quirks. You know what I'm saying? Like having a gap in your teeth, trendy. I could see that being trendy. I could even see people going in, 
[P69]  they don't have any quirks, going and getting quirks manufactured, going and getting a gap in your in your teeth, like going to get it grinded. Can you even do that? I don't know. Get the gap grinded down so that you have a gap in your teeth or like, you know, getting an ear implant so that your ears look unique or like getting freckles tattooed or shaving off your eyebrows. I can't explain this, but I just see a trend happening where looking 
[P70]  or quirky becomes a trend. Because the last few years, it's been trendy to all get the same procedures that make you look like a perfect Barbie doll. And I think the opposite is going to become trendy. So people who already have a gap in their teeth or already have a bunch of freckles or already have a mole on their lip or have a birthmark on their face, like these things are going to be really celebrated. And at times, 
[P71]  perhaps even manufactured. I think there's a chance that it'll become like a cosmetic procedure trend to like add quirks to your appearance. I don't know. I don't know if it's even possible. Like, could you go to a dentist and say like, I want to get a gap in my teeth like Madonna? Does she have a gap in her teeth? I think she does. Yeah. Like I want a Madonna gap in my teeth. Would the dentist do it? Probably. Um, I don't know. 
[P72]  that might be far-fetched, but I could kind of see it. Okay. Next 60s mod it's in. There's a lot of different little elements of the 1960s mod aesthetic that I think are going to come back. Some of them are going to be isolated. Like, okay. How do I explain this? Like, I don't think people are going to be like dressing up like a 1960s mod Halloween costume. Okay. 
[P73]  But I think a lot of elements of the 1960s mod aesthetic are going to come back on their own, if that makes sense. So I'm not saying this whole aesthetic is going to come back into style altogether all at once. I just think a lot of these things are going to be trendy and it's not going to be in like a in like a Halloween costume sort of way. Does that make sense? Because if you were to Google 1960s mod, you'd see a very specific sort of aesthetic, right? 
[P74]  style top in skirt, lots of color blocking, lots of classic patterns, dramatic big collars and buttons, very kitschy, very of the 1960s, right? It looks very 1960s. I don't think it's going to be that on the nose. And I don't think that like the 1960s mod aesthetic is going to come back all at once, all at the same time. Does that make sense? But there are many key elements from that era that I think are going to come back. 
[P75]  for one, the pixie haircut. The pixie haircut on women was very popular in the 60s. I think it's coming back. Now, listen, I know a lot of you are thinking, Emma, you just cut all your hair off. You got a pixie. So that's why you're saying that you think the pixie's back. But meanwhile, Emma, you look like Ellen DeGeneres. Yeah, I know. Okay. Everyone's saying I look like fucking Ellen DeGeneres since I got my little blonde pixie. All good. I still think the 
[P76]  is coming back. And I don't think I believe that just because I have a pixie and because I plan on having a pixie for the next indefinitely. Like I have no plans to grow my hair back out. I love having short hair. I think it's coming back, number one, because it's really chic, honestly. When done right, it is really chic, number one. Number two, low maintenance and easy. It is so freeing. And I think a lot of women are going to be, 
[P77]  I don't know, like if they see other women doing it, they'll feel invited to do it themselves too. Because it's really scary to go and get a pixie haircut when it's not trending. I'll tell you, it's really scary because it's a risky haircut. But if other people start doing it, I think it's going to become, I don't know, it's like a domino effect. The more people that have a pixie haircut, the more people that will feel empowered to do it themselves. And it's so cool to me and it's so comfortable and fun to style. 
[P78]  I don't know. I just think the pixie's great and I think it's going to come back. Another 1960s mod vibe, color blocking. A technique that involves wearing multiple solid colored clothing items in an outfit, often in complimentary colors. This sort of goes hand in hand with the idea of minimalist design, sort of white t-shirt, black pant, black sweater with the white, you know what I mean? Like very simple color blocking, easy on the eyes. Those two things go hand in hand in my mind. 
[P79]  I think this sort of simplicity is going to be really appealing this year, especially because I think the concept of having a lot of simple pieces and building more intricate outfits using a bunch of simple pieces is going to be really in this year because it's a more sustainable way to play with fashion, whereas constantly shopping and buying new unique pieces and making outfits with them once or twice and then donating them. Like, I just think people are going to get sick of that. 
[P80]  cadence of buying and donating and buying and donating and dealing with clutter and stuff like that. So I think the concept of color blocking is going to work really well. You know, you can wear a green t-shirt with a pair of blue pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of brown pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of orange pants. And you know what I mean? And it's, it's always, it's going to bring a different feeling every single time because it's a different combination of clothes, but that was all just with one shirt. 
[P81]  You put a little vest over that shirt. Now it feels different. It's like, I think layering and color blocking is going to be in, which is definitely very 1960s mod. Also classic patterns, stripes, polka dots, plaids, like simple timeless patterns that are always in. Very 60s mod. I think that'll be in. Simple minimalist designs are very 1960s mod. 
[P82]  just classic silhouettes that we all know and love, especially with like little skirts and dresses, timeless. And you can't go wrong. I started seeing 60s mod silhouettes on the runway like last year. And I was like, oh man, that's really going to come back in a big way. And it hasn't fully come back yet, but I think this is the year that it will. And last but not least, more modest silhouettes. I feel like the 1960s, 
[P83]  2020's aesthetic was very classy, very modest. And I could see that coming back, weirdly enough. Like a longer skirt, a boxier fit, not skin tight. I think that's going to be in. Yeah. Okay, moving on from 1960s mod, the digital watch. The digital watch. 
[P84]  analog clock. Everyone under the age of 40 prefers a digital watch, prefers a digital clock in general. None of us know how to read a clock under the age of 40. None of us. And if we do, it takes us at least five minutes to read the fucking clock. 5, 10, 15, 20. Oh, wait, what's the longhand do? It's not good. Digital watches are fucking back. You know, it was all about having like a chic wrist stack, 
[P85]  with like a beautiful Cartier watch or like a beautiful Rolex or whatever, or like a beautiful metal watch. You know, that was very trendy for a while there. Don't get me wrong. I actually do think that a lot of times those pieces of jewelry are timeless, but I think it's going to become cool to wear like a plastic Casio digital watch. In fact, I've been wearing one for the past few months, inspired by someone in my life who does wear a digital watch. Okay. 
[P86]  story, actually. This came from somebody in my life who wears a digital watch. They're the only person I know who wears a digital watch. And I remember the first day I met this person, I saw them and they were wearing a digital watch. And I remember looking at it and thinking to myself, what the fuck is going on? They're wearing a big plastic digital watch. And I was like, I have not seen somebody wear a digital watch like this who's under the age of 60. Like in, 
[P87]  Maybe ever. Like, I'm shocked by this. And as I got to know this person, I was like, hold on a minute. They're a fucking genius, to be honest. The digital watch is weatherproof. I mean, you can wear the digital, like, plasticky sort of watch anywhere. In the shower, to your workout. And a lot of times they're cheaper than the metal watches, so you're not worried about them. But more importantly, it's actually a readable watch. 
[P88]  the digital, like I just look at my wrist now that I've been wearing this rubber digital watch for the last like six months. I just look at my wrist and I know exactly what time it is. And there's no, there's no stress. And I actually think it looks cool. I did not think it looked cool at first when I saw this person wearing their digital watch the first time I met them. I, to be honest, I was like, I don't like it. I don't like that watch. What is that watch? Take that thing off. And then it grew on me and I was like, no, I actually think it's really, it's really genius. 
[P89]  myself I could see the digital watch coming back in which takes me to my next trend prediction nerd vibes remember in the 2010s when like it was all about nerds like everybody wanted to wear like suspenders and like glasses that had the white tape around the center like nerdcore I could see that coming back in in 2025 and I think the digital watch is like a great example 
[P90]  example of what that looks like. But I could see a trend of people tying tape around their glasses, like around their reading glasses. I don't think suspenders are going to come back in. I could see, I can see this now when I close my eyes. Like imagine this outfit. This is to me is like a stereotypical sort of nerd outfit. Now, by the way, the word nerd, I don't know, like stereotyping people as nerds. 
[P91]  listen, I don't know if it's politically correct, but like everyone's a nerd in a little, in a sort of way. And by nerdy, I mean like dorky, which I think is charming. Like it's not, I'm not using the word nerd in any sort of derogatory way, but there is sort of like a stereotypical sort of nerd aesthetic, right? When I close my eyes and think about what version of nerd is going to come back in 2025, I think of the glasses with the tape wrapped around the center, you know, 
[P92]  nose bridge, right? Very stereotypical nerd. I think of a sweatshirt, maybe like just like a basic sweatshirt or a funny t-shirt that's like, maybe it doesn't fit particularly well. I think of maybe like a utilitarian pant of sorts, like a cargo pant, perhaps a cargo short, you know, things that are considered not necessarily fashionable or not necessarily 
[P93]  chic, right? Perhaps like a sort of narrow fitting shoe, like a small narrow fitting shoe, like a little sneaker that's sort of a bit nerdy, like almost like a little Merrill or like a little Keen or like a little like Adidas that's sort of narrow, like, I don't know, like a narrow, small sneaker. That's the kind of nerd that I'm imagining. And I think that that's going to be really in this year. 
[P94]  Almost like how everybody became obsessed with, like, Adam Sandler's street style. Because he would just wear, like, a dumpy pair of, like, basketball shorts and, like, an oversized T-shirt and, like, sneakers. And he just looked kind of like a mess. But everybody loved it. And I think that that's going to be back. Where it's, like, nerdy, like, computer lover vibes. Like, early 2000s nerd vibes. I see that coming back. Okay, next. Okay, hear me out. Clogs. 
[P95]  Clogs are so bad. I keep seeing people wearing clogs. Like I'm starting to see it happen. And I think 2025 is the year of the clog, which leads me to a broader prediction I have, which is sort of like gardening chef core. Okay. Now I'm not talking about cutesy little gardening, cutesy little chef. Like I actually weirdly imagine people taking inspiration from what chefs actually, 
[P96]  wear or like what you really wear gardening. You know what I'm saying? Like the utilitarian gardening gloves. OK, a utilitarian chef's waist apron. I could see these things becoming fashionable. And I think it's going to go hand in hand with, you know, gardening and cooking becoming trendy as an activity this year. But I really could see like I'm looking up gardening outfit on 
[P97]  Google gardening outfit. Let's see what comes up. Okay. Yeah. Like apron. I could weirdly see aprons like, okay, obviously not like a literal kitchen apron or a literal gardening apron, but like little waist aprons, honestly kind of useful too. Like I would wear that if, if I saw like in a thrift store or something, like a cute little waist belt apron, I would totally buy that and wear that like over jeans, honestly cute. I'm seeing some 
[P98]  overalls. I don't know. I don't know the overalls are going to be in perhaps. I mean, it's part of the gardening aesthetic. Let me look up chef outfit. Yeah. Like I'm looking at chef outfits. It's very often the, the double button sort of jacket, right. Or shirt that could come in. Like, I don't know. I feel like gardening in chef aesthetic is going to be in. I mean, listen, do I think people are going to be wearing like a large 
[P99]  white chef's hat? No, but I don't know. Listen, this is how I feel and it could be totally off base, but I just, I don't know. That's what my gut is telling me. Clogs, aprons, utilitarian gardener, utilitarian chef, you know? Ah, fuck. I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Last but not least, nautical vibes. Okay. The ocean, the sea, fishermen, the whole thing. And this, 
[P100]  This has been rumbling under the surface for a while now. In fact, this honestly goes hand in hand with my boat shoe prediction, right? But I think it's going to expand. It's going to expand in 2025 and more nautical fishermen elements are going to become trendy. One very specific example, yellow raincoat and yellow rain boots. Mark my words. 
[P101]  very nautical fishermen outdoorsy, okay? This is something that I want. Honestly, if this becomes trendy and brands start making yellow raincoats and yellow rain boots, I will be buying a pair of each because I'm really into this trend. I think, again, like a lot of the things that I've mentioned today are super classic and timeless. Stripes, minimalist design, 
[P102]  boots. Like those are classic pieces, right? But I think that all of these classic pieces are going to come back because of trend fatigue, right? This isn't a coincidence that a lot of these things are really classic. A yellow raincoat and yellow rain boot, it doesn't get more classic than that. Not only does it fall under the sort of nautical category, which I think is coming back anyway, but it's also timeless. I'm super into it. This is actually one of the few things that I personally will 
[P103]  be buying if I see a version of it that appeals to me because it really excites me. And if this prediction is true or even if it's not, I'm probably going to get my hands on it anyway because I really want a yellow pair of rain boots and I really want a yellow raincoat. It just is cute and I just want it. But jumping off of that, I think perhaps a pop of yellow could be the new pop of red. Last year, it was all about the pop of red. I could see a pop of yellow becoming the new pop of red. That's just a brief side note. It doesn't really have anything to do 
[P104]  with nautical, but I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Back to nautical. Blue and white stripes. Okay. I think stripes are going to be all the rage. I think they're going to be all the rage in a bazillion different ways. Like the black and white stripe, indie sleaze. Blue and white stripe, nautical aesthetic. Okay. Red and white stripe, nautical aesthetic. I think a nautical stripe is going to be really in, which I absolutely love. 
[P105]  classic cable knit sweaters, like thick, chunky, high quality looking, simple, one color, neutral colors, cable knit sweater, like a cream cable knit sweater, a blue cable knit sweater, not neon, not bright, muted, muted colors, muted colors, cable knit sweater, very fisherman looking, very vintage looking, but not vintage in like an eighties way. No, 
[P106]  Oh, classic, classic, simple, neutral cable knit sweater. Thick knit, thick, thick yarn. Not thin, not flimsy, thick, boxy, fisherman cable knit sweater. Little fisherman's hats, okay? Like a little tight little beanie or like a little tight little cap that has no bill at the front. Like it's just a little fisherman's cap, a little, do you know what those are? Like a little cap? Cap? 
[P107]  with no front bill. What is that called? Great. I found it. Yeah. It's a no brim hat, a pillock's hat. Is that what it's called? Pillock's. Watch that be like some sort of like really rude derogatory term. I always get, no, it's not called a pillock's. Oh, is it pillbox or pillock's? This is not what I'm looking for. This is wrong. It's a no brim hat, brimless hat. 
[P108]  those are in. I actually almost bought a brimless hat like six months ago. I didn't end up buying it because the material was a little bit too cheap for my liking, but I've had my eye on those for a while now and I think they're going to be in. And last but not least, in the world of nautical fashion, this is not very fisherman aesthetic. This is not very, it's not even that nautical, like it is nautical, but it's like, it's a bit more elevated 
[P109]  it? Pearls. I think pearls are in. Like a little pearl necklace. I don't know. I feel like pearls haven't been in for a while. And I could see pearls having a moment this year. Like a chic, classic pearl. I don't know. I could see it happening. Okay. That is what I think is going to be in in 2025. If I literally get one of those predictions correct, I will be so stoked. I mean, the truth of the matter is, 
[P110]  lot of those predictions aren't even fully predictions because a lot of them are already starting to pop up now or like they already were popping up last year, but maybe they just weren't mainstream yet. And I think they're going to go mainstream this year. And then some things were more random, but we shall see. Here's what I think is going to go out of style in 2025. These are the things that I predict are really going to go out. 
[P111]  of style in 2025. Number one, every single niche in aesthetic and core that happened in 2024, every single one. We really, really had a quick trend cycle last year. And I think every single thing that we experimented with last year is just absolutely over this year. Every trend that popped up last year, we wore to death. 
[P112]  thing. Like very few things from last year that were big are going to make it to this year. I think most of them are going to die in 2024. Next, dressing exactly like another era on the nose. Okay. Almost like period dressing, not like period dressing, like, oh, I'm about to have my period. So I'm wearing black pants so that I don't stain my pants. I mean, like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I don't even know what the term for that would be, but you get the idea. Over the last few years, 
[P113]  There's been moments where it's been trendy to dress exactly like a certain era on the nose. OK, like Y2K on the nose. That was really trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 90s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing really 70s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 80s on the nose. This is all within the last five years. OK, at any point in time over the last five years, 
[P114]  there's been a trend of dressing like a certain era, whether it's Y2K or 90s or 80s or 70s or 60s. Actually, not really 60s as much, but do you get what I'm saying? Like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I think that that's out completely. And I know that I mentioned 90s minimalism and I know that I mentioned 60s mod as being in, but I more mean elements from those time periods. I don't mean like dressing exactly 
[P115]  like that time period. I think that dressing exactly like a certain time period, it always sort of feels costume-esque, which is not timeless. Mixing and matching various references from various decades and making something kind of new and kind of your own, I think that's probably better. And I think that that's going to be what people are doing in 2025. I think it's going to look costumey to 
[P116]  dress exactly Y2K, exactly 90s, exactly 70s. You know what I mean? Even exactly 60s mod, even though I think a lot of elements of the 60s mod are going to be in. I think if you dress up like you're somebody in the 60s mod era, it's going to look costumey. And I think that that's not going to fly in 2025. Next camo. Camo is so done. It's done. Unless you're literally like a deer hunter, 
[P117]  or you're in the army. Like, no, if you're just, if you're like, like a little fashion kid in New York wearing the camo, I think that might be out. I think that might be out. I think that pattern is out. I'm sorry. I never loved it, which is, by the way, if you love camo, I'm not even kidding. If you love camo still, by all means, wear camo. Okay. It's none of my business, but I think it's out. It got really big in 2024. And I think, 
[P118]  It's going to be out. Next, the whole soccer jersey trend, like it was such a trend to wear like international soccer jerseys. That is out. Everybody give your Argentinian soccer jersey for a team that you don't know back to your little brother who actually cares about the team. Do you know what I'm saying? Like it's done. We're not wearing those jerseys anymore unless it's genuine. If you genuinely love a certain soccer team 
[P119]  them and whatever like that's different but there was a lot of people buying soccer jerseys and other sort of similar jerseys for the sake of fashion or stealing them from their little brothers give it back you know find somebody who you know who actually likes the team and give it to them just it's it's over uh and last but not least don't get mad at me for this designer dupes there's a big trend of buying designer dupes 
[P120]  last year, which I don't think is necessarily bad. If you really love something and you can find a dupe, I'm not going to judge you. You know, that's not, it's not about like moral righteousness. I'm not saying like designer dupes are out for 2025 because they're wrong. I am not the moral police here. Okay. I think it's out because I think people are going to choose to spend that money on something unique instead. Does that make sense? 
[P121]  Like instead of buying a dupe of something, why not take that money and buy something that just costs that much? You know, that's from like a cool, small little brand that you found online or at like a flea market or something. You know what I mean? I just think designer dupes are out because I think things that are explicitly designer are out. I think if you listen to my last episode about what I think is in and out for 2025, I talked a lot about how I think flexing and extravagance and showing off wealth. 
[P122]  all of this is out. And so I think as a result, you know, designer, like buying a designer dupe is out. Like, I just don't think people are going to be wasting their money on buying a dupe or something. Like, who cares? You know, like wearing designer things that are clearly designer aren't as, I think a bit of the excitement around that is gone. There are probably so many more trend predictions that I could come up with and so many things that I think are out, but that's all I have for right now. 
[P123]  have to cut myself off or else I'll talk for nine hours. And if I keep going, I'll also just list every single possible possibility, which also makes it less fun. It's like if I just, if I predict every single possible thing, like I think the 70s are going to be in and the 80s and the 90s and the 2000s. I think they're all going to be in. Then if I get one right, it doesn't matter because I actually listed every single possible thing that could ever possibly happen. So we're going to stop here. 
[P124]  you all for listening and hanging out. I hope that you enjoyed this episode. If I said something rude about something that you like, literally allow that to strengthen your love for that particular item, right? If I came on here and said, I hate camo, I did say that. If me saying I hate camo upsets you because you love camo, allow that to further strengthen your love for camo. Say, 
[P125]  know what? When Emma said she hated camo, it made me so mad because I love camo and Emma doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about. Great. Great. Wear whatever the fuck you want. Pay attention to the trend cycles. Ignore the trend cycles. Do whatever you want to do. Okay. Fashion is about you. Use fashion as a tool that benefits you. And it's not that deep. I love talking about it though. Oh my God. I love talking about fashion, but it's not that deep, but we'll see what happens. We'll see if I get anything 
[P126]  right. I really, really think the yellow raincoat, I keep almost calling it a rain coot. It's very weird. Uh, I really do think that the yellow raincoat and the yellow rain boots are going to come back that I have the same feeling about that, that I had about the boat shoes. Like it was almost like, uh, it was like God came down and told me. So we'll see. Anywho, that's all I have to say. Thank you all for listening and hanging out. It's always a pleasure. If you enjoyed it, come back.

[P1] ﻿ About a year ago, I predicted the boat shoe trend. Yeah, I did. And can I be honest? Since then, I've been chasing that feeling. The feeling of predicting a trend and then seeing it in the real world, I imagine rivals the feeling of seeing your newborn baby for the first time. Like, I think I'll probably feel that excited again on the day that I give birth to my first child. That's the next time I'll feel that level of satisfaction, unless, 
[P2]  I'm able to successfully predict another trend before that, which is what I'm going to try to do today. Today, I am going to share with you my 2025 fashion trend predictions. If I can get even one of these right, I'll be able to match that feeling I got when I predicted the boat shoe coming back. But I'm being realistic here. I don't have a crystal ball. Some of these predictions are random gut feelings. 
[P3]  are based on what I've studied sort of starting to become popular over the past few years, but haven't fully gone mainstream yet. And I predict that this year they will go mainstream. So it's a combination of gut feelings and educated guesses. The educated guesses are less satisfying if they come true because it's like I saw it coming in the world, right? The gut feelings, those, if they come true, 
[P4]  more rewarding. So hopefully, well, whatever. I'll just be happy if I get anything right. So let's begin. 2025 fashion trend predictions. I briefly paused this episode of Anything Goes to let you know that this episode of Anything Goes is presented by Amazon. Getting sick is horrible enough. The getting better part shouldn't be horrible too. Waiting on hold for an appointment, sitting in crowded waiting rooms, 
[P5]  That's almost as bad as the sickness itself. Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy remove these painful parts of getting better with things like 24-7 virtual visits and prescriptions delivered to your door. Thanks to Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy for sponsoring today's episode. Now let's get back to the episode. We're starting out with the obvious. I've been talking about this for a while now, so this shouldn't be a shock to anyone. Minimalism. 
[P6]  a lifestyle perspective. I'm not talking about owning less clothes. I'm talking about minimalistic design, okay? Now, what is that, you may ask? Don't worry. I Googled it for you, and I have the definition right here. Minimalism is a style that prioritizes simplicity, clean lines, neutral colors, and timeless silhouettes, focusing on quality over quantity and emphasizing essential, versatile pieces rather than trendy, 
[P7]  clothing. Now, I've been talking about minimalism coming back for so long. I'm sick of talking about it, too. OK, so I won't overemphasize this point, but I think minimalism in one way or another is always in. I don't know. I even feel like the clean girl aesthetic of 2023, 2024 was kind of minimalist in a way because it was a sort of style that consisted of simplicity and clean 
[P8]  and neutral colors and timeless silhouettes. So, you know, when I say that minimalism is coming back, what comes to my mind is like 90s minimalism. Let's Google 90s minimalism. Okay, if you Google 90s minimalism, this is what comes up. I'm looking on British Vogue at an article called The Minimalist 90s Outfits Inspiring My Summer Wardrobe, just to give some examples of some minimalist outfits. 
[P9]  I see a plain white t-shirt with some simple pinstripe dress pants and a matching pinstripe dressy little vest. I see classic blue jeans. I see classic black boots. A lot of simple tank tops, t-shirts in neutral colors. Lots of black and white button down shirts. 
[P10]  simple dress pants or capris, classic just suit jackets, blazers, simple dresses that aren't super tight in neutral colors, lots of black boots, lots of plain, simple, flat loafers, black, white, brown. I mean, yeah, it's just, it's like, it's very, it's simple, but it does still have swag. And the swag element is what's really 
[P11]  really hard to put a finger on. Somehow 90s minimalism, when you Google it, it doesn't look boring. There's magic happening with it somehow. I don't know. I see 90s minimalism really being the main trend this year. And here's the thing. The truth of the matter is minimalism in clothing design is timeless. Like a white button down, a pair of blue jeans, a pair of black slacks, a pair of little simple black loafers, a black boot. 
[P12]  a white t-shirt. These things are never out. They are always in. So a lot of people I've seen online saying like, minimalism is just another trend. It's not preventing people from buying more stuff. People are going to buy minimalist design. And then when that's out, they're going to go and they're going to buy maximalist design again. Minimalist stuff is just as trendy as maximalist stuff. I actually disagree. There's kind of a debate happening on the internet around 
[P13]  whether or not minimalist designs are timeless, whether or not they come in and out of style. I definitely do think they have trendy moments, but I think unlike maximalist designs, they're always in and no one can change my mind. Okay. I think minimalist design is really going to be in, in 2025, but it's never going to be out because it's too simple to ever be in or out. You know what I'm saying? If you were doing sort of the clean girl aesthetic, 
[P14]  2024, 2023, 2024, which consisted of, you know, the slick back bun, the trench coats, the dress pants, the little loafers, the little button up shirts. It's just very like chic and classy. Literally, just by styling that slightly different, maybe doing your hair a little bit different, maybe accessorizing a little bit differently, you now have 90s minimalism, right? And then in a few years when there's a new sort of minimalist style that's in, you can, 
[P15]  reuse those pieces again. I just, I really do think when it comes to trends, any sort of minimalist trend to me is the safest one to buy into because you actually can reuse those pieces in a million different ways. So I think investing in good minimalist pieces, I would be shocked if you regretted it, you know, unless you're just a maximalist at heart and you don't like clothes like that. Fair enough. 
[P16]  buy, you know, good basics and stuff. Like I think that's going to be really in and styling them in unique ways that have sort of magic. I think that's going to be in, but I don't think it's something we're ever going to look back at and cringe at, which is cool. It's cool when a trend also is timeless and it's rare. So I think this is one of the rare times when something timeless will be trendy. Moving on. Okay. So in 2024, the concept of 
[P17]  Jane Birkening your bag. Are we remembering this? This is the concept of taking your purse and attaching a bunch of personalized objects onto it, tying a bandana onto it, putting little charms on it, attaching jewelry to it, inspired by Jane Birken of the 60s, who carried around her iconic Birken bag that she attached a bunch of little accessories to that were personal to her. 
[P18]  and then gets a bit warm and then ties it around her purse to give her neck some air. That's the idea, right? Organically and authentically accessorizing her purse through necessity and convenience, weirdly enough, became a trend in 2024 where everybody was buying charms and finding bandanas and things in their drawers and then adding it to their bag to make it look authentic like Jane Birkin's bag. Fascinating trend. 
[P19]  think it's ending in 2025. I think it's going to expand in 2025. In 2024, it was all about the bag, right? Accessorizing the bag in that way. I think in 2025, it's about doing that with everything, okay? Your favorite hat, put a bunch of pins on it. Embroider a heart into it. Put a patch on it. On your jacket, there's a rip. You sew it with contrasting thread. Let's say it's a black jacket. You fix the 
[P20]  the rip with white thick thread, you know, you put pins on it, you put patches on it, your favorite pair of jeans, you put little accessories on the belt loops. You again, put patches, sew up the holes with bright thread, you know, paint your name onto the pocket, like accessorize, accessorize, accessorize with shoes, paint on your shoes. Like you get what I'm saying? Like making your pieces, 
[P21]  really, really unique to you. Because I think that what's going on right now is that a lot of people are craving a sense of personal style. And I've seen a lot of discourse around personal style and how personal style is sort of dead because of the internet. Whether or not that's true, that's a conversation for another day. But I think this idea of personalization is going to give people the feeling of personal style. Because 
[P22]  you can have the same pair of jeans as somebody else. In fact, you probably do. What sets you apart is how you personalize them. What sets them apart is that it's the pair that is your favorite that you wear three days a week. You know, this idea of really personalizing your items and having less items as well. Because I think prior to recently, it's been all about having a lot of stuff, having a lot of clothes, especially if you're into fashion, having as many options as possible so that you can constantly 
[P23]  be wearing a new outfit. That was sort of trendy, right? For many years to always be wearing a new outfit, to never wear the same outfit twice. I think that that's out. And I think having signature pieces that are super personalized that you wear over and over and over again and you style a multitude of ways, I think that's in. I even thought about it in terms of the Stanley Cup, which is not really a fashionable thing. That's more of like a pop culture obsession. 
[P24]  a Stanley Cup. I have a Stanley Cup. But I even thought about it like this. Like, this is almost a metaphor for what I mean for fashion in like clothing and stuff. It's the idea of like, instead of having every single color of Stanley Cup, instead of having the bright pink one and the blue one and the sparkly white one and the brown one and the orange one and the green one, you just have one that's your favorite color and you put stickers on it. You take your watch 
[P25]  the middle of the day and you attach it to your Stanley cup and you, it's like truly a utilitarian, like fully functional item. And it is your personal favorite item. It becomes a special thing to you. If you only have one and the one that you do have, you use every day or very consistently. And it looks like you, it becomes your iconic Stanley cup. That I think is going to be cool. That's going to be the way that we 
[P26]  consume, I think, in 2025. Instead of having nine pairs of jeans, you have two and they're both really special. And they're known as like, oh, those are Emma's jeans. Like if somebody were to see your signature pair of jeans on a mannequin in a store, they'd be like, wait, those are what? Those are Emma's jeans. You see what I'm saying here? 
[P27]  re-wear over and over and over again. I honestly love this idea and hope that it ends up happening because I think something that a lot of us are missing, especially those of us who love fashion and love to participate in fashion, is a sort of attachment to our belongings, our clothing, our accessories. Nowadays, it's about buying more by whatever means necessary, thrifting, buying online for really cheap, 
[P28]  money, whatever. And it's impossible to have any sort of attachment or appreciation for the pieces that you have when you have more than you could ever wear. Do you know what I'm saying? So I think we're going to swing in the opposite direction and it'll become cool to be seen in your iconic pair of jeans that everybody knows are your jeans. Does that make sense? Like it'll be cooler to repeat stuff. I don't know. We'll see. That might be a pipe dream. 
[P29]  Okay, next. Gaunt makeup. By gaunt makeup, I mean no blush, no highlighter, no faux freckles. I'm talking about sharp contour, otherwise sort of even complexion, right? Like you're not adding blush. You're not adding freckles. You're not adding all this stuff. Other than that, it's just like sort of flat, not dewy, but also not matte sort of face with contour. 
[P30]  Cool tones, neutral tones, but mainly cool tones. Kind of gaunt makeup. This to me is very like 90s minimalist as well. It kind of goes hand in hand with that vibe. But it also goes hand in hand with another one of my predictions. I feel like the makeup trend for the past few years has been really sweet, really warm, really youthful, really bright, 
[P31]  happy. And I think there's going to be a shift to more of a grungier sort of darker sort of look. And, you know, I'm actually not mad about this because I've been doing my makeup like this when I do my own makeup anyway for quite a while now, mainly because I think it emphasizes my personal features the best. Like, I don't think I look good when I have a lot of blush on or when I have, you know, like highlighter on my 
[P32]  little nose and in the little corners of my eye, in the little inner corner of my eye. Like, I just don't really look good like that. In my opinion, like I look better, in my opinion, with more like Tim Burton-y kind of makeup. I like that. I mean, I also like the Tim Burton movies and I grew up watching them and loving them. And it's more of like a sort of creepy sort of vibe. And I've always loved that. So, and I feel like, you know, I have the dark circles under my eyes and I have sort of big eyes. 
[P33]  kind of maybe I wish like a Tim Burton character. I can only dream that I look like a Tim Burton character, but it's like, so I like to make myself look even more like a Tim Burton character by like not covering my dark circles with concealer, by just doing like light face makeup that just exactly matches my skin tone and is like not even noticeable. It just makes it look like I just have more even complexion than I do. Contouring the face, cool toned neutrals on the eyes, 
[P34]  mascara, and then like a deep pinky brown overlined lip. And it makes my eyes look like big and scary and the dark circle looks dark. And I like it. I just, I like it. I don't know why, but I actually think it's going to be in. And I could be wrong. Cause I mean, I've been doing it for a few years now, maybe like two or three, perhaps. I don't remember. Maybe like two years now, but I think it's going to be in. And that actually leads us to indie sleaze, which is also already, 
[P35]  in, but will be even more so in, in like a big way. Indie sleaze really started to come back in 2024, but I think in 2025, it's going to reach its peak because it definitely hasn't reached its peak yet. It definitely hasn't. Let's Google what indie sleaze is so that we can all be up to date. Okay. Indie sleaze is a term that describes a style of music and fashion that was popular 
[P36]  in the United States and UK from around 2006 to 2012. The fashion was an affordable, messy, and lethargic take on vintage styles, especially from the 70s. Indy sleeves fashion is characterized by mismatched, out of proportion, and chaotic pieces. Some examples include metallic leggings, tunics, knit beanies, fedoras, and chunky costume pearls. Okay, let's fucking relax on that. I'm not... That is not what I see coming back, but I see a version of Indy sleeves coming back. 
[P37]  That means in a minute because I don't agree on all of this. The fedora is like the fedora is insane. Like that is not coming back. Knee high socks are also a key part of the indie sleaze look, whatever. A tongue in cheek style that was influenced by Brooklyn hipster fashion, 70s, 80s, electro rock music, pop art, super flat pop, whatever, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? The style grew in popularity on sites like Tumblr and MySpace and was often seen as a counterculture reaction to the economic climate of the recession. Yeah. 
[P38]  I do think that this is happening again. It's obviously not going to be exactly the same as it was in 2006 to 2012, but I think there's going to be a lot of similarities in 2025. That's my prediction. Okay. I just said the gaunt makeup, the gaunt sort of like party girl gaunt makeup, very indie sleaze to take it a step further in makeup, smudgy black eye makeup. I could see that coming, 
[P39]  back, definitely black and white stripes. To me, black and white stripes, so indie sleeves to me and I fucking love it. And to me, black and white stripes are timeless, but I think they're really going to come back and I can't wait. I'm wearing black and white stripes right now. So yeah, ripped tights, DIY cut up shirts. Like that was very indie sleeves, like cutting the sleeves off and the neck off of your own shirt and it being all like saggy and like lopsided and weird looking. The 
[P40]  Union Jack, which is the United Kingdom's flag, you know, the red, white and blue sort of star looking Union Jack. That was super indie sleaze. I think that's going to come back. I do think certain more extreme indie sleaze details will come back, potentially like a metallic legging like Google provided for me. And last but not least, I do think skinny jeans are coming back. There's been so much discourse. I can't even stay away from the discourse around 
[P41]  skinny jeans. Everybody's debating, are the skinny jeans coming back this year? Are they not? To be honest, I haven't seen anyone really wearing skinny jeans, at least in my world or in my algorithm. Like the algorithm is not feeding me videos of people wearing skinny jeans. So I haven't seen it in action yet, but I do think this year skinny jeans are back as a part of Indie Sleaze vibes. But I don't think it's what we're all afraid of. I think we're all afraid of jeggings. That's what we're all really afraid of. 
[P42]  Skinny jeans themselves, yeah, they're not great. But I think what we're really all traumatized by is like low-waisted jeggings. That was skinny jeans at their worst form in, you know, the 2010s. That's not coming back, okay? So don't worry. We're not going to be spending 10 minutes getting our super skinny, low-waisted jeggings up our legs before work or school. Like that's never happening again, right? 
[P43]  but I do think skinny jeans are going to come back. But I think that they're actually going to be less hideous than we imagine. In fact, when I think about styling skinny jeans, I'm not repulsed, which is really frightening. Because a few years ago, if you would have asked me if skinny jeans would ever come back, I would have said maybe, but like, I will never, like, I can't even imagine it. Like, it's going to be hideous. I could see it being cool. I could see it being cool. I'm definitely thinking outside the box, 
[P44]  when I'm thinking of skinny jeans looking cool, but it's not impossible. It's not impossible. And I think it will be done this year. Am I going to participate? Probably not. Although never say never, because I might get inspired and really want to do it. And I might pick up a pair, but I doubt it. And I'm going to wait as long as possible until I'm exploding and bursting at the seams and need to wear skinny jeans, which I don't think will happen. But again, never say never. I think a very specific type of skinny jean is going to come back. Real denim, like stiff, 
[P45]  real denim that's not so skin tight to the leg that it like takes two hours to get up like reasonably tight but not like impossibly tight like what was popular in the 2010s I think timeless washes right like classic denim washes nothing that's like acid wash super ripped and distressed none of that black denim I think will be fine but like 
[P46]  No extreme denim washes. And I think it might, I think it might work. I think it might work. The only thing I'm struggling with is like what shoe perhaps tucked into a boot. Oh my God. Like a skinny jean tucked into like a moto boot. Oh my God. I'm scared. Is that going to happen? Or like a skinny jean with like a little ballet flat or like a little flat shoe of some sort. Ooh, it might happen. I don't know. I could see people talking little skinny jeans into boots. I could definitely see that. 
[P47]  I don't know. We'll have to see. It might not happen, but I definitely could see the skinny jean coming back. Anyway, Indie Sleaze, I think it's back this year. It already started in 2024, so I'm not some sort of genius for predicting that, but I think it's going to hit its peak this year. Okay, next. Micro glitter matte lipstick. Okay, close your eyes and think about the early 2000s and think about the makeup trends and think about the lipstick that the beloved women in your life were wearing. 
[P48]  shimmery. It was light pink. It was micro glitters. It was like almost holographic. I think that that's coming back. You know, I was thinking about the makeup that my mom wore when I was a kid randomly the other day, like completely randomly, like I was daydreaming and that just popped into my head. And I was like, that lipstick is definitely going to come back. I just had this gut feeling. And then like a week or two later, I was watching 
[P49]  the first episode of Sex and the City for the first time, actually, because I've never watched that show. My friends were watching the first episode of Sex and the City, and I noticed that the main character was wearing that type of lipstick. And I was like, whoa, there it is again. I totally see it. Micro glitter, shimmer, matte lipstick, early 2000s lipstick vibe. Just, I don't know. I see it coming back. I see it coming back. Okay, next. 
[P50]  random. This is literally so random. Polka dots. Yeah. Polka dots. Listen, you'll notice that I'm saying a lot of timeless, classic, obvious patterns. Stripes I mentioned earlier. Polka dots I'm mentioning now. I'm going to mention stripes probably one or two more times because I think stripes are really going to be in this year. I know what you're thinking. Emma, these are the most obvious, timeless patterns. I know. But I think that that's 
[P51]  why they're going to be in this year. I think we all have such trend fatigue from keeping up with trends for the past few years. We're so exhausted with the speed of trend cycles. I think a lot of people are going to be making timeless choices this year, almost out of necessity. Like, oh my God, what can I buy that I can wear for more than six months without getting bored of it? You know? And so I think classic patterns like stripes and polka dots are going to be in. But specifically, 
[P52]  we're talking about polka dots right now. I actually, I usually get red nails when I go to the nail salon. I just always get red nails. But the last time I was there, I got little polka dots because I really do believe that polka dots are going to be stylish again. I think that they're always stylish, but I think it's going to be one of those patterns that we're not going to be able to get away from. Luckily, I think if you buy something polka dot now, you'll be able to wear it forever. 
[P53]  Because I do think that polka dots are very timeless. But I do think we might get a little bit bored of polka dots by the end of this year. I could see that happening. If they do fully come back to the extent that I think that they will. But I personally love polka dots. Like I'm actually really excited. And I don't know. I think like polka dot tights, polka dot, like a black and white polka dot jacket, like trench coat, little pops of polka dots here and there. 
[P54]  I think is going to be in. We'll see. Next, asymmetrical stuff. This is something I'm predicting because I've been seeing it pop up more and more on Pinterest. And I actually have a few asymmetrical pieces in my closet that I've collected over the years. So it definitely has been in already for the last few years, but I think it's going to be mainstream this year. I think it's going to be huge. Like everything's going to be asymmetrical. And by asymmetrical, 
[P55]  I mean, like, let's say you have a little sweater. Instead of the buttons going down the middle, the buttons are going down the left side of the sweater. Or even weird shit, like a shirt where one sleeve is long and one sleeve is short. Or a skirt where, like, the left side of the skirt is long and the right side of the skirt is, like, a foot shorter. Or a seam that goes down a weird part of the shirt. Or, like, do you see what I'm saying? Asymmetrical stuff. 
[P56]  asymmetry is going to be in. I think to take it a step further, minimalist design that is asymmetrical. So like a classic white button down, but the buttons are like on the left side. Do you see what I'm saying? That is going to be so in. Taking like minimalist design and then really just making it asymmetrical. Oh man, people are going to love that. Okay, next. Buttons are the new bows. Yeah, I think that. And I'm frightened. 
[P57]  I'm frightened because I love buttons. To me, buttons are timeless, but I think that they're going to be used as a textural element instead of as a functional element, right? Like buttons are technically used on a garment as sort of a closure mechanism, right? Buttons are used to close the garment, right? I think buttons are going to become trendy to the point where there's buttons everywhere on shit. Buttons don't even need to be there. 
[P58]  a purpose where they are. And can I be honest? I love this. And I think it's timeless. And I think it might become trendy, but I don't even care because I'm going to love that for the rest of my life. I hope it becomes trendy because then I'm going to buy up all the cool stuff. No, I'm not. I'm trying to not have a shopping addiction this year or ever again for the rest of my life. So I will not buy it up. Maybe I'll buy one special button item. But I am 
[P59]  a button tattooed on my arm. So I'm worried that it's going to become trendy to put buttons on everything and then everyone's going to start to hate buttons. And then my tattoo of a button is going to look cringe and basic. Not that there's anything wrong with being basic, but I have a button tattoo on my arm because my favorite movie is Coraline and the button is one of the main symbols of the movie. And so that's why I have a button on my arm. 
[P60]  And that's why I love buttons so much. Also, just because they're freaking cute. They're so cute. Anyway, the reason why I think buttons are the new bows, though, is because similar to a bow, like bows are absolutely timeless. A bow is a bow. It's too crucial of a design element to not be timeless. Like bows will always exist. Bows will always be in. You know what I mean? 
[P61]  will be. But I think the same thing that happened with bows will happen with buttons where we put bows on everything, right? Everybody was tying ribbon around everything. Everybody was, you know, attaching little bows to everything. Brands were coming out with stuff that just had bows all over it. There's just so many bows. It was like, oh my God, we need to stop with the bows. They're not serving a purpose. They're just here and it's stale. It became stale very quickly. 
[P62]  same thing will happen with buttons where it's like, you know, a button doing its normal button function, closing a garment will always be cool. That's timeless. But buttons being in a place just for the sake of buttons, I think might not be as timeless for majority of people. And I think majority of people will get sick of buttons in that way. Except for me, because I love buttons so much and have such a personal connection to buttons. 
[P63]  And it will never be wrong. To me, a button is never wrong. Next. So this is not necessarily like a fashion trend in the sense of like clothing or makeup or whatever. This is more of like a physical human body trend, which listen, I'm not saying that we should have body related trends. Okay. I don't think, I don't think that that's great. Right. 
[P64]  However it's the case. For the last few years, the trend has been sort of Barbie doll aesthetic. You know what I mean? Looking like a Barbie doll. Being perfectly symmetrical, having plump lips, having plump cheekbones, having the perfect little nose. Like people, you know, many, many, many, many, many, many, many people were going and, you know, getting cosmetic procedures done to accomplish this look. 
[P65]  a trend to get certain procedures done. Right. Well, I actually think that that's over. I think everyone looking the same like a little Barbie doll. I think that that's out. And listen, I'm not trying to shit on anyone who looks that way or who has, you know, chosen to go get those procedures or do whatever. Like, I get it. OK, I get it. If that's what you like or that's what you liked in the past, it's none of my business. It's up to you what you do with your face or body. 
[P66]  or whatever. I don't care. But I think it's gotten to the point now where everybody's sort of getting the same procedures done, right? Everybody's getting their lips done. A lot of people are getting rhinoplasty, he's getting their nose done. A lot of people are getting filler and Botox in the same areas, right? There's sort of become a trend of getting these certain procedures done. And what's ended up happening is a lot of people look the same. Oh my God, veneers, like getting veneers, super trendy, fake teeth that are super 
[P67]  perfect, this has become a trend, perfection, right? And now we have a lot of people who have a very similar nose and have very similar teeth and have a very similar jawline and have a very similar, you know, whatever. Listen, we're all different, but like there's definitely a lot of similarities. And so I think as a response to that, it's going to become trendy to have aesthetic quirks about your look. Now, listen, 
[P68]  In an ideal world, it would be a trend to have your own unique quirks, whatever those may be, right? So like everybody's different, meaning everybody has their own unique quirks and those are all inherently trendy. Unfortunately, that's not how our society works. I see it being like cherry picked sorts of quirks. You know what I'm saying? Like having a gap in your teeth, trendy. I could see that being trendy. I could even see people going in, 
[P69]  they don't have any quirks, going and getting quirks manufactured, going and getting a gap in your in your teeth, like going to get it grinded. Can you even do that? I don't know. Get the gap grinded down so that you have a gap in your teeth or like, you know, getting an ear implant so that your ears look unique or like getting freckles tattooed or shaving off your eyebrows. I can't explain this, but I just see a trend happening where looking 
[P70]  or quirky becomes a trend. Because the last few years, it's been trendy to all get the same procedures that make you look like a perfect Barbie doll. And I think the opposite is going to become trendy. So people who already have a gap in their teeth or already have a bunch of freckles or already have a mole on their lip or have a birthmark on their face, like these things are going to be really celebrated. And at times, 
[P71]  perhaps even manufactured. I think there's a chance that it'll become like a cosmetic procedure trend to like add quirks to your appearance. I don't know. I don't know if it's even possible. Like, could you go to a dentist and say like, I want to get a gap in my teeth like Madonna? Does she have a gap in her teeth? I think she does. Yeah. Like I want a Madonna gap in my teeth. Would the dentist do it? Probably. Um, I don't know. 
[P72]  that might be far-fetched, but I could kind of see it. Okay. Next 60s mod it's in. There's a lot of different little elements of the 1960s mod aesthetic that I think are going to come back. Some of them are going to be isolated. Like, okay. How do I explain this? Like, I don't think people are going to be like dressing up like a 1960s mod Halloween costume. Okay. 
[P73]  But I think a lot of elements of the 1960s mod aesthetic are going to come back on their own, if that makes sense. So I'm not saying this whole aesthetic is going to come back into style altogether all at once. I just think a lot of these things are going to be trendy and it's not going to be in like a in like a Halloween costume sort of way. Does that make sense? Because if you were to Google 1960s mod, you'd see a very specific sort of aesthetic, right? 
[P74]  style top in skirt, lots of color blocking, lots of classic patterns, dramatic big collars and buttons, very kitschy, very of the 1960s, right? It looks very 1960s. I don't think it's going to be that on the nose. And I don't think that like the 1960s mod aesthetic is going to come back all at once, all at the same time. Does that make sense? But there are many key elements from that era that I think are going to come back. 
[P75]  for one, the pixie haircut. The pixie haircut on women was very popular in the 60s. I think it's coming back. Now, listen, I know a lot of you are thinking, Emma, you just cut all your hair off. You got a pixie. So that's why you're saying that you think the pixie's back. But meanwhile, Emma, you look like Ellen DeGeneres. Yeah, I know. Okay. Everyone's saying I look like fucking Ellen DeGeneres since I got my little blonde pixie. All good. I still think the 
[P76]  is coming back. And I don't think I believe that just because I have a pixie and because I plan on having a pixie for the next indefinitely. Like I have no plans to grow my hair back out. I love having short hair. I think it's coming back, number one, because it's really chic, honestly. When done right, it is really chic, number one. Number two, low maintenance and easy. It is so freeing. And I think a lot of women are going to be, 
[P77]  I don't know, like if they see other women doing it, they'll feel invited to do it themselves too. Because it's really scary to go and get a pixie haircut when it's not trending. I'll tell you, it's really scary because it's a risky haircut. But if other people start doing it, I think it's going to become, I don't know, it's like a domino effect. The more people that have a pixie haircut, the more people that will feel empowered to do it themselves. And it's so cool to me and it's so comfortable and fun to style. 
[P78]  I don't know. I just think the pixie's great and I think it's going to come back. Another 1960s mod vibe, color blocking. A technique that involves wearing multiple solid colored clothing items in an outfit, often in complimentary colors. This sort of goes hand in hand with the idea of minimalist design, sort of white t-shirt, black pant, black sweater with the white, you know what I mean? Like very simple color blocking, easy on the eyes. Those two things go hand in hand in my mind. 
[P79]  I think this sort of simplicity is going to be really appealing this year, especially because I think the concept of having a lot of simple pieces and building more intricate outfits using a bunch of simple pieces is going to be really in this year because it's a more sustainable way to play with fashion, whereas constantly shopping and buying new unique pieces and making outfits with them once or twice and then donating them. Like, I just think people are going to get sick of that. 
[P80]  cadence of buying and donating and buying and donating and dealing with clutter and stuff like that. So I think the concept of color blocking is going to work really well. You know, you can wear a green t-shirt with a pair of blue pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of brown pants, and then you can wear the green t-shirt with a pair of orange pants. And you know what I mean? And it's, it's always, it's going to bring a different feeling every single time because it's a different combination of clothes, but that was all just with one shirt. 
[P81]  You put a little vest over that shirt. Now it feels different. It's like, I think layering and color blocking is going to be in, which is definitely very 1960s mod. Also classic patterns, stripes, polka dots, plaids, like simple timeless patterns that are always in. Very 60s mod. I think that'll be in. Simple minimalist designs are very 1960s mod. 
[P82]  just classic silhouettes that we all know and love, especially with like little skirts and dresses, timeless. And you can't go wrong. I started seeing 60s mod silhouettes on the runway like last year. And I was like, oh man, that's really going to come back in a big way. And it hasn't fully come back yet, but I think this is the year that it will. And last but not least, more modest silhouettes. I feel like the 1960s, 
[P83]  2020's aesthetic was very classy, very modest. And I could see that coming back, weirdly enough. Like a longer skirt, a boxier fit, not skin tight. I think that's going to be in. Yeah. Okay, moving on from 1960s mod, the digital watch. The digital watch. 
[P84]  analog clock. Everyone under the age of 40 prefers a digital watch, prefers a digital clock in general. None of us know how to read a clock under the age of 40. None of us. And if we do, it takes us at least five minutes to read the fucking clock. 5, 10, 15, 20. Oh, wait, what's the longhand do? It's not good. Digital watches are fucking back. You know, it was all about having like a chic wrist stack, 
[P85]  with like a beautiful Cartier watch or like a beautiful Rolex or whatever, or like a beautiful metal watch. You know, that was very trendy for a while there. Don't get me wrong. I actually do think that a lot of times those pieces of jewelry are timeless, but I think it's going to become cool to wear like a plastic Casio digital watch. In fact, I've been wearing one for the past few months, inspired by someone in my life who does wear a digital watch. Okay. 
[P86]  story, actually. This came from somebody in my life who wears a digital watch. They're the only person I know who wears a digital watch. And I remember the first day I met this person, I saw them and they were wearing a digital watch. And I remember looking at it and thinking to myself, what the fuck is going on? They're wearing a big plastic digital watch. And I was like, I have not seen somebody wear a digital watch like this who's under the age of 60. Like in, 
[P87]  Maybe ever. Like, I'm shocked by this. And as I got to know this person, I was like, hold on a minute. They're a fucking genius, to be honest. The digital watch is weatherproof. I mean, you can wear the digital, like, plasticky sort of watch anywhere. In the shower, to your workout. And a lot of times they're cheaper than the metal watches, so you're not worried about them. But more importantly, it's actually a readable watch. 
[P88]  the digital, like I just look at my wrist now that I've been wearing this rubber digital watch for the last like six months. I just look at my wrist and I know exactly what time it is. And there's no, there's no stress. And I actually think it looks cool. I did not think it looked cool at first when I saw this person wearing their digital watch the first time I met them. I, to be honest, I was like, I don't like it. I don't like that watch. What is that watch? Take that thing off. And then it grew on me and I was like, no, I actually think it's really, it's really genius. 
[P89]  myself I could see the digital watch coming back in which takes me to my next trend prediction nerd vibes remember in the 2010s when like it was all about nerds like everybody wanted to wear like suspenders and like glasses that had the white tape around the center like nerdcore I could see that coming back in in 2025 and I think the digital watch is like a great example 
[P90]  example of what that looks like. But I could see a trend of people tying tape around their glasses, like around their reading glasses. I don't think suspenders are going to come back in. I could see, I can see this now when I close my eyes. Like imagine this outfit. This is to me is like a stereotypical sort of nerd outfit. Now, by the way, the word nerd, I don't know, like stereotyping people as nerds. 
[P91]  listen, I don't know if it's politically correct, but like everyone's a nerd in a little, in a sort of way. And by nerdy, I mean like dorky, which I think is charming. Like it's not, I'm not using the word nerd in any sort of derogatory way, but there is sort of like a stereotypical sort of nerd aesthetic, right? When I close my eyes and think about what version of nerd is going to come back in 2025, I think of the glasses with the tape wrapped around the center, you know, 
[P92]  nose bridge, right? Very stereotypical nerd. I think of a sweatshirt, maybe like just like a basic sweatshirt or a funny t-shirt that's like, maybe it doesn't fit particularly well. I think of maybe like a utilitarian pant of sorts, like a cargo pant, perhaps a cargo short, you know, things that are considered not necessarily fashionable or not necessarily 
[P93]  chic, right? Perhaps like a sort of narrow fitting shoe, like a small narrow fitting shoe, like a little sneaker that's sort of a bit nerdy, like almost like a little Merrill or like a little Keen or like a little like Adidas that's sort of narrow, like, I don't know, like a narrow, small sneaker. That's the kind of nerd that I'm imagining. And I think that that's going to be really in this year. 
[P94]  Almost like how everybody became obsessed with, like, Adam Sandler's street style. Because he would just wear, like, a dumpy pair of, like, basketball shorts and, like, an oversized T-shirt and, like, sneakers. And he just looked kind of like a mess. But everybody loved it. And I think that that's going to be back. Where it's, like, nerdy, like, computer lover vibes. Like, early 2000s nerd vibes. I see that coming back. Okay, next. Okay, hear me out. Clogs. 
[P95]  Clogs are so bad. I keep seeing people wearing clogs. Like I'm starting to see it happen. And I think 2025 is the year of the clog, which leads me to a broader prediction I have, which is sort of like gardening chef core. Okay. Now I'm not talking about cutesy little gardening, cutesy little chef. Like I actually weirdly imagine people taking inspiration from what chefs actually, 
[P96]  wear or like what you really wear gardening. You know what I'm saying? Like the utilitarian gardening gloves. OK, a utilitarian chef's waist apron. I could see these things becoming fashionable. And I think it's going to go hand in hand with, you know, gardening and cooking becoming trendy as an activity this year. But I really could see like I'm looking up gardening outfit on 
[P97]  Google gardening outfit. Let's see what comes up. Okay. Yeah. Like apron. I could weirdly see aprons like, okay, obviously not like a literal kitchen apron or a literal gardening apron, but like little waist aprons, honestly kind of useful too. Like I would wear that if, if I saw like in a thrift store or something, like a cute little waist belt apron, I would totally buy that and wear that like over jeans, honestly cute. I'm seeing some 
[P98]  overalls. I don't know. I don't know the overalls are going to be in perhaps. I mean, it's part of the gardening aesthetic. Let me look up chef outfit. Yeah. Like I'm looking at chef outfits. It's very often the, the double button sort of jacket, right. Or shirt that could come in. Like, I don't know. I feel like gardening in chef aesthetic is going to be in. I mean, listen, do I think people are going to be wearing like a large 
[P99]  white chef's hat? No, but I don't know. Listen, this is how I feel and it could be totally off base, but I just, I don't know. That's what my gut is telling me. Clogs, aprons, utilitarian gardener, utilitarian chef, you know? Ah, fuck. I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Last but not least, nautical vibes. Okay. The ocean, the sea, fishermen, the whole thing. And this, 
[P100]  This has been rumbling under the surface for a while now. In fact, this honestly goes hand in hand with my boat shoe prediction, right? But I think it's going to expand. It's going to expand in 2025 and more nautical fishermen elements are going to become trendy. One very specific example, yellow raincoat and yellow rain boots. Mark my words. 
[P101]  very nautical fishermen outdoorsy, okay? This is something that I want. Honestly, if this becomes trendy and brands start making yellow raincoats and yellow rain boots, I will be buying a pair of each because I'm really into this trend. I think, again, like a lot of the things that I've mentioned today are super classic and timeless. Stripes, minimalist design, 
[P102]  boots. Like those are classic pieces, right? But I think that all of these classic pieces are going to come back because of trend fatigue, right? This isn't a coincidence that a lot of these things are really classic. A yellow raincoat and yellow rain boot, it doesn't get more classic than that. Not only does it fall under the sort of nautical category, which I think is coming back anyway, but it's also timeless. I'm super into it. This is actually one of the few things that I personally will 
[P103]  be buying if I see a version of it that appeals to me because it really excites me. And if this prediction is true or even if it's not, I'm probably going to get my hands on it anyway because I really want a yellow pair of rain boots and I really want a yellow raincoat. It just is cute and I just want it. But jumping off of that, I think perhaps a pop of yellow could be the new pop of red. Last year, it was all about the pop of red. I could see a pop of yellow becoming the new pop of red. That's just a brief side note. It doesn't really have anything to do 
[P104]  with nautical, but I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Back to nautical. Blue and white stripes. Okay. I think stripes are going to be all the rage. I think they're going to be all the rage in a bazillion different ways. Like the black and white stripe, indie sleaze. Blue and white stripe, nautical aesthetic. Okay. Red and white stripe, nautical aesthetic. I think a nautical stripe is going to be really in, which I absolutely love. 
[P105]  classic cable knit sweaters, like thick, chunky, high quality looking, simple, one color, neutral colors, cable knit sweater, like a cream cable knit sweater, a blue cable knit sweater, not neon, not bright, muted, muted colors, muted colors, cable knit sweater, very fisherman looking, very vintage looking, but not vintage in like an eighties way. No, 
[P106]  Oh, classic, classic, simple, neutral cable knit sweater. Thick knit, thick, thick yarn. Not thin, not flimsy, thick, boxy, fisherman cable knit sweater. Little fisherman's hats, okay? Like a little tight little beanie or like a little tight little cap that has no bill at the front. Like it's just a little fisherman's cap, a little, do you know what those are? Like a little cap? Cap? 
[P107]  with no front bill. What is that called? Great. I found it. Yeah. It's a no brim hat, a pillock's hat. Is that what it's called? Pillock's. Watch that be like some sort of like really rude derogatory term. I always get, no, it's not called a pillock's. Oh, is it pillbox or pillock's? This is not what I'm looking for. This is wrong. It's a no brim hat, brimless hat. 
[P108]  those are in. I actually almost bought a brimless hat like six months ago. I didn't end up buying it because the material was a little bit too cheap for my liking, but I've had my eye on those for a while now and I think they're going to be in. And last but not least, in the world of nautical fashion, this is not very fisherman aesthetic. This is not very, it's not even that nautical, like it is nautical, but it's like, it's a bit more elevated 
[P109]  it? Pearls. I think pearls are in. Like a little pearl necklace. I don't know. I feel like pearls haven't been in for a while. And I could see pearls having a moment this year. Like a chic, classic pearl. I don't know. I could see it happening. Okay. That is what I think is going to be in in 2025. If I literally get one of those predictions correct, I will be so stoked. I mean, the truth of the matter is, 
[P110]  lot of those predictions aren't even fully predictions because a lot of them are already starting to pop up now or like they already were popping up last year, but maybe they just weren't mainstream yet. And I think they're going to go mainstream this year. And then some things were more random, but we shall see. Here's what I think is going to go out of style in 2025. These are the things that I predict are really going to go out. 
[P111]  of style in 2025. Number one, every single niche in aesthetic and core that happened in 2024, every single one. We really, really had a quick trend cycle last year. And I think every single thing that we experimented with last year is just absolutely over this year. Every trend that popped up last year, we wore to death. 
[P112]  thing. Like very few things from last year that were big are going to make it to this year. I think most of them are going to die in 2024. Next, dressing exactly like another era on the nose. Okay. Almost like period dressing, not like period dressing, like, oh, I'm about to have my period. So I'm wearing black pants so that I don't stain my pants. I mean, like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I don't even know what the term for that would be, but you get the idea. Over the last few years, 
[P113]  There's been moments where it's been trendy to dress exactly like a certain era on the nose. OK, like Y2K on the nose. That was really trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 90s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing really 70s on the nose was trendy for a little bit. Dressing super 80s on the nose. This is all within the last five years. OK, at any point in time over the last five years, 
[P114]  there's been a trend of dressing like a certain era, whether it's Y2K or 90s or 80s or 70s or 60s. Actually, not really 60s as much, but do you get what I'm saying? Like dressing exactly like a certain time period. I think that that's out completely. And I know that I mentioned 90s minimalism and I know that I mentioned 60s mod as being in, but I more mean elements from those time periods. I don't mean like dressing exactly 
[P115]  like that time period. I think that dressing exactly like a certain time period, it always sort of feels costume-esque, which is not timeless. Mixing and matching various references from various decades and making something kind of new and kind of your own, I think that's probably better. And I think that that's going to be what people are doing in 2025. I think it's going to look costumey to 
[P116]  dress exactly Y2K, exactly 90s, exactly 70s. You know what I mean? Even exactly 60s mod, even though I think a lot of elements of the 60s mod are going to be in. I think if you dress up like you're somebody in the 60s mod era, it's going to look costumey. And I think that that's not going to fly in 2025. Next camo. Camo is so done. It's done. Unless you're literally like a deer hunter, 
[P117]  or you're in the army. Like, no, if you're just, if you're like, like a little fashion kid in New York wearing the camo, I think that might be out. I think that might be out. I think that pattern is out. I'm sorry. I never loved it, which is, by the way, if you love camo, I'm not even kidding. If you love camo still, by all means, wear camo. Okay. It's none of my business, but I think it's out. It got really big in 2024. And I think, 
[P118]  It's going to be out. Next, the whole soccer jersey trend, like it was such a trend to wear like international soccer jerseys. That is out. Everybody give your Argentinian soccer jersey for a team that you don't know back to your little brother who actually cares about the team. Do you know what I'm saying? Like it's done. We're not wearing those jerseys anymore unless it's genuine. If you genuinely love a certain soccer team 
[P119]  them and whatever like that's different but there was a lot of people buying soccer jerseys and other sort of similar jerseys for the sake of fashion or stealing them from their little brothers give it back you know find somebody who you know who actually likes the team and give it to them just it's it's over uh and last but not least don't get mad at me for this designer dupes there's a big trend of buying designer dupes 
[P120]  last year, which I don't think is necessarily bad. If you really love something and you can find a dupe, I'm not going to judge you. You know, that's not, it's not about like moral righteousness. I'm not saying like designer dupes are out for 2025 because they're wrong. I am not the moral police here. Okay. I think it's out because I think people are going to choose to spend that money on something unique instead. Does that make sense? 
[P121]  Like instead of buying a dupe of something, why not take that money and buy something that just costs that much? You know, that's from like a cool, small little brand that you found online or at like a flea market or something. You know what I mean? I just think designer dupes are out because I think things that are explicitly designer are out. I think if you listen to my last episode about what I think is in and out for 2025, I talked a lot about how I think flexing and extravagance and showing off wealth. 
[P122]  all of this is out. And so I think as a result, you know, designer, like buying a designer dupe is out. Like, I just don't think people are going to be wasting their money on buying a dupe or something. Like, who cares? You know, like wearing designer things that are clearly designer aren't as, I think a bit of the excitement around that is gone. There are probably so many more trend predictions that I could come up with and so many things that I think are out, but that's all I have for right now. 
[P123]  have to cut myself off or else I'll talk for nine hours. And if I keep going, I'll also just list every single possible possibility, which also makes it less fun. It's like if I just, if I predict every single possible thing, like I think the 70s are going to be in and the 80s and the 90s and the 2000s. I think they're all going to be in. Then if I get one right, it doesn't matter because I actually listed every single possible thing that could ever possibly happen. So we're going to stop here. 
[P124]  you all for listening and hanging out. I hope that you enjoyed this episode. If I said something rude about something that you like, literally allow that to strengthen your love for that particular item, right? If I came on here and said, I hate camo, I did say that. If me saying I hate camo upsets you because you love camo, allow that to further strengthen your love for camo. Say, 
[P125]  know what? When Emma said she hated camo, it made me so mad because I love camo and Emma doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about. Great. Great. Wear whatever the fuck you want. Pay attention to the trend cycles. Ignore the trend cycles. Do whatever you want to do. Okay. Fashion is about you. Use fashion as a tool that benefits you. And it's not that deep. I love talking about it though. Oh my God. I love talking about fashion, but it's not that deep, but we'll see what happens. We'll see if I get anything 
[P126]  right. I really, really think the yellow raincoat, I keep almost calling it a rain coot. It's very weird. Uh, I really do think that the yellow raincoat and the yellow rain boots are going to come back that I have the same feeling about that, that I had about the boat shoes. Like it was almost like, uh, it was like God came down and told me. So we'll see. Anywho, that's all I have to say. Thank you all for listening and hanging out. It's always a pleasure. If you enjoyed it, come back.

[P1] [SPEAKER_04]: This is The Indicator from Planet Money.
[P2] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm Darian Woods.
[P3] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm Waylon Wong, and it is Jobs Friday.
[P4] [SPEAKER_02]: The latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the economy added 143,000 jobs in January.
[P5] [SPEAKER_02]: The unemployment rate nudged down a tiny bit from December to 4%.
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.
[P12] [SPEAKER_02]: But is this offer even legal?
[P13] [SPEAKER_02]: Just yesterday, a federal judge paused the offer until at least Monday of next week.
[P14] [SPEAKER_02]: Today on the show, an employment lawyer walks us through the government's deal, which has plunged the federal workforce into confusion and uncertainty.
[P15] [SPEAKER_02]: And we talked to some of those government employees about how they've been weighing this critical decision to stay or go.
[P16] [SPEAKER_05]: This message comes from WISE, the app for doing things in other currencies.
[P17] [SPEAKER_05]: Sending or spending money abroad?
[P18] [SPEAKER_05]: Hidden fees may be taking a cut.
[P19] [SPEAKER_05]: With WISE, you can convert between up to 40 currencies at the mid-market exchange rate.
[P20] [SPEAKER_05]: Visit WISE.com.
[P21] [SPEAKER_05]: TNCs apply.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: Support for NPR and the following message come from Bowlin Branch.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: Change your sleep with Bowlin Branch's airy blankets, cloud-like duvets, and breathable sheets.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Feel the difference with 15% off your first order at bowlinbranch.com with code NPR.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: Exclusions apply.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: See site for details.
[P27] [SPEAKER_05]: This message comes from Monday.com.
[P28] [SPEAKER_05]: Work management platforms.
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: Red tape, endless adoption time, IT bottlenecks.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: And after all that, nobody really uses them.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But what if you didn't hate your work platforms?
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: What if you actually loved it?
[P33] [SPEAKER_05]: Monday.com work management platform is different.
[P34] [SPEAKER_05]: You can make any changes you want and adapt it to your needs in an instant.
[P35] [SPEAKER_05]: No admin middleman.
[P36] [SPEAKER_05]: That's why people actually love using it.
[P37] [SPEAKER_05]: Monday.com, the first work platform you'll love to use.
[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.
[P48] [SPEAKER_02]: One of those employees works at the National Park Service as a museum curator.
[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.
[P59] [SPEAKER_02]: The fork in the road email shared similarities with the memo that Twitter employees received in 2022 after Elon Musk took over.
[P60] [SPEAKER_02]: It even used the title fork in the road.
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.
[P86] [SPEAKER_02]: There's also the cautionary tale of Twitter, the last organization to get Elon Musk's fork in the road memo.
[P87] [SPEAKER_02]: The company, now known as X, is reportedly facing lawsuits from thousands of former employees who say that, among other things, they didn't get the severance package they were promised.
[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.
[P102] [SPEAKER_04]: The other employee we talked to, the museum curator at the National Park Service, said she never considered quitting.
[P103] [SPEAKER_01]: I love my job.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely devoted to being a public servant in the National Park Service, and I'm going to keep telling the stories and doing the work that I believe in until I can't do it anymore.
[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.
[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.
[P107] [SPEAKER_04]: Critics worry that a hatchet versus scalpel approach to the government workforce will have consequences.
[P108] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says in his experience, the vast majority of federal employees are dedicated to their mission.
[P109] [SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.
[P110] [SPEAKER_06]: But possible byproduct of the Trump administration's designs to thin out the federal workforce is that people may begin to understand firsthand what happens when you gut the federal government.
[P111] [SPEAKER_02]: The federal judge who paused the buyout program is scheduled to hear arguments next week.
[P112] [SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, a separate but similar resignation offer has gone out to employees at the CIA.
[P113] [SPEAKER_02]: This episode was produced by Angel Correras with engineering by Robert Rodriguez and Neil Tevold.
[P114] [SPEAKER_02]: It was fact-checked by Sierra Juarez.
[P115] [SPEAKER_02]: Kicking Cannon is our show's editor, and The Indicator is a production of NPR.
[P116] [SPEAKER_09]: Technologist Pau Garcia is using AI to create photos of people's most precious memories.
[P117] [SPEAKER_07]: How her mother was dressed, the haircut that she remembered regenerated tens of images.
[P118] [SPEAKER_07]: And then she saw two images that was like, that was it.
[P119] [SPEAKER_09]: Ideas about the future of memory.
[P120] [SPEAKER_08]: That's on the TED Radio Hour podcast from NPR.
[P121] [SPEAKER_08]: On the ThruLine podcast, the myth linking autism and vaccines was decades in the making and was a major moment for vaccine hesitancy in America, tapping into fears involving the pharmaceutical industry and the federal government.
[P122] [SPEAKER_03]: No matter how many studies you do showing that this is not a problem, it's very hard to unring the bell.
[P123] [SPEAKER_08]: Listen to ThruLine from NPR wherever you get your podcasts.
[P124] [SPEAKER_05]: Support for NPR and the following message come from the Lemelson Foundation, working to harness the power of invention and innovation to accelerate climate action and improve lives around the world.

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.
[P7] [SPEAKER_05]: This time, we're going to dive deeper into several investing themes.
[P8] [SPEAKER_05]: Over the years, they've refined their process, evolving from using systems such as Peter Lynch's PEG ratio to using systems based on return on equity, and now using the Rule of 40, which is just a very, very powerful tool for spotting fast-growing companies with multi-bagger potential.
[P9] [SPEAKER_05]: We'll also discuss how they navigate the ever-changing market landscape, including why the market consistently underprices quality growth stocks, and how they analyze a business's moat by tracking key financial metrics.
[P10] [SPEAKER_05]: They'll also break down their stock ranking system, their approach to position sizing, and the geographical differences in stock valuation between the US and Canada.
[P11] [SPEAKER_05]: Since Jason is ex-military and Jesse is a current professional athlete on top of what he's already doing with Donville Kent Asset Management, I wanted to learn how their backgrounds have helped them develop the resilience needed to thrive in investing, especially during market drawdowns.
[P12] [SPEAKER_05]: We'll also explore how they stay engaged during bear markets, why they believe AI is transforming business fundamentals, and how they find the best opportunities in small and mid-cap stocks, a space that many investors tend to overlook.
[P13] [SPEAKER_05]: I highly respect their ability to just cut through the noise and focus on high conviction investments as well as having high levels of concentration in those investments.
[P14] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, as holders of Constellation Software, since it IPO'd, we'll also talk about their views on why they prefer it over at Spinoffs, Topicus, and Lumine.
[P15] [SPEAKER_05]: And finally, with money market funds at all-time highs, we'll get their take on how and when this massive cash pile might flow back into equities and what that could mean for stock market performance.
[P16] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, without further ado, let's get right into this week's episode with Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble.
[P17] [SPEAKER_00]: Since 2014 and through more than 180 million downloads, we've studied the financial markets and read the books that influence self-made billionaires the most.
[P18] [SPEAKER_00]: We keep you informed and prepared for the unexpected.
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Now for your host, Kyle Greve.
[P20] [SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the Investor's Podcast.
[P21] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host, Kyle Grieve, and today we welcome Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble onto the show.
[P22] [SPEAKER_05]: Jason, Jesse, welcome to the podcast.
[P23] [SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[P24] [SPEAKER_05]: Great to be here.
[P25] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P26] [SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having us, Kyle.
[P27] [SPEAKER_05]: So it was great here going through your letters.
[P28] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, it's been a couple of times I've prepped for our first interview back on millennial investing and now for this one.
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?
[P33] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sir, I'll jump in.
[P34] [SPEAKER_03]: And I think a starting point would be to look at our process.
[P35] [SPEAKER_03]: So what Jason and I each have is what we call our stock trackers.
[P36] [SPEAKER_03]: So we have our universe of stocks that we're looking at and it's changing all the time.
[P37] [SPEAKER_03]: But what we're doing is we're trying to compare apples to apples.
[P38] [SPEAKER_03]: So if you say this company looks cheap,
[P39] [SPEAKER_03]: this company looks expensive, but we'll take that numbers and we'll compare it to our universe being like, okay, well, on those growth metrics, on those earnings margins, on that PE, actually, it doesn't look that good because I can find 20 other stocks that look a lot better, right?
[P40] [SPEAKER_03]: So maybe it is really, really cheap.
[P41] [SPEAKER_03]: And if it's only growing 10%, maybe it does scream really well.
[P42] [SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's where we start is, is it growing?
[P43] [SPEAKER_03]: What's its return on equity?
[P44] [SPEAKER_03]: And then once it's multiple, and if you just take any stock without comparing it to anyone else, yeah, maybe it looks good.
[P45] [SPEAKER_03]: But what we're trying to do is we're trying to optimize, right?
[P46] [SPEAKER_03]: So we're only trying to own mid 10 or 15.
[P47] [SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you will make money in a name, but we're trying to find the best 10 to 15.
[P48] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I would say that our thinking on valuation has evolved quite a bit over the years, or at least in my case, because I've been doing this since the early 90s, so 92, 93, right?
[P49] [SPEAKER_01]: And originally, I tend to look at growth a little bit more simply, and there was a ratio we used to have called the Lynch ratio, which is you wanted the company to be growing faster in its PE.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: So if it was trading on 15 times, you wanted better than 15% growth.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: Then we evolved into return on equity.
[P52] [SPEAKER_01]: So we were looking for companies with consistently high returns on equity, typically 20% or better.
[P53] [SPEAKER_01]: Then what happened with so much M&A is the balance sheets got distorted that calculating ROE accurately became a problem.
[P54] [SPEAKER_01]: So then we started in the last five or six years pivoting to the rule of 40, right?
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: Which is the combination of the revenue growth plus the margin of the company, right?
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: All three of those approaches, so the Lynch approach, the ROE approach, and the Rule of 40, they're all kind of trying to get at the same thing, which is some kind of a quick and dirty metric when you're screening a universe of 10 or like 1,000 stocks to allow you to get down to 30 that you can take a closer look at.
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: So I would say now that we look at the...
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: the rule of 40, but when you're doing a factor dive into a database, right?
[P59] [SPEAKER_01]: And for people who are listening to this podcast, they'll know what I'm saying here.
[P60] [SPEAKER_01]: And you're really looking for four factors.
[P61] [SPEAKER_01]: You start by, let's say factor one would be market cap.
[P62] [SPEAKER_01]: I want it to be a billion dollar market cap and greater.
[P63] [SPEAKER_01]: So you sort your database that cuts your database in half.
[P64] [SPEAKER_01]: Then you say, I want companies that are only growing at 15% or better.
[P65] [SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[P66] [SPEAKER_01]: You put those factors in.
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: The point is that those three or four factors you pick and the order in which you look at those factors has a big influence on what you're ultimately going to look at.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: And with my looking at both where everybody, Buffett included, wants both value and growth, I want growth and I'm prepared to live with some slippage on value.
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: There's other people who are hardcore value investors where they're value first, and then they'll rationalize growth kind of later, right?
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of have to get a sense of what's your natural tendency.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: And in the current environment, particularly with so much interesting tech stuff going on in the world, I'm not...
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm really interested in initiating a new position, and I think, Jesse, you'd probably be similar, but I'm not.
[P73] [SPEAKER_01]: If they're not growing by consistently at 15% per year, the 9%, 10%, 11% grower just doesn't interest me because with all the stuff that's happening in tech, there is enough out there that's growing at 15% a year.
[P74] [SPEAKER_01]: And the margins of profitability, we can make that a separate conversation, but as far as that starting point that I'm looking for, I'm looking for 15% growth.
[P75] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P76] [SPEAKER_03]: And what we talk about a lot is, you know, what we look for, we call them compounders.
[P77] [SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's probably more that gets thrown into that than it should.
[P78] [SPEAKER_03]: But the idea of compound growth from what we can tell, and we've done historical studies on this, it's just continually undervalued by the market, right?
[P79] [SPEAKER_03]: Like humans can't really, like we think in a linear manner.
[P80] [SPEAKER_03]: So if you're saying, if this company is going to compound at 15, 20% for five years,
[P81] [SPEAKER_03]: you could put a significantly higher multiple on that and still make money, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_03]: Like if you do that with five, 10 years of compounding.
[P83] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I think that whole value growth, it kind of gets a bit disruptive.
[P84] [SPEAKER_03]: There is a lot of value in growth, but when you have a company and if it's growing and so it's improving its underlying value of its business at 20% a year,
[P85] [SPEAKER_03]: You know, the stock would fluctuate around, but five years from now, if it's growing at 20% a year, I guarantee, you know, you've made a lot of money unless you're extremely overpaid.
[P86] [SPEAKER_03]: And there is a bit of valuation discipline there.
[P87] [SPEAKER_05]: So just from going through your letters and talk with you guys, I know that you guys are long-term business owners, which I really appreciate.
[P88] [SPEAKER_05]: And you're looking for businesses that you can tend to hold for, let's say, five to 10 years.
[P89] [SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like you just mentioned there, Jason, the business world is changing pretty rapidly.
[P90] [SPEAKER_05]: And a company's competitive advantage can kind of erode pretty quickly here if you take your foot off the gas pedal.
[P91] [SPEAKER_05]: So I don't necessarily think this is a new convention, but I've noticed it on a couple of the businesses that I've owned that I thought had very secure moats and then ended up being pretty weak.
[P92] [SPEAKER_05]: My question here for you guys is, how often do you guys think you're missing the mark on some of your picks?
[P93] [SPEAKER_05]: And given your concentrated nature, how are you mitigating some of the downside risk?
[P94] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would start with, like you said, a deteriorating mode shows up in the numbers, right?
[P95] [SPEAKER_03]: We've owned Constellation for, what is it, like 15 years or something.
[P96] [SPEAKER_03]: And the idea was always, I would love large numbers or competition.
[P97] [SPEAKER_03]: And now the AI side of it,
[P98] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, if that mold starts to deteriorate, you'll see it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_03]: You'll see it in growth.
[P100] [SPEAKER_03]: You'll see it in margins.
[P101] [SPEAKER_03]: Or the other argument was that they'll have to start buying lower.
[P102] [SPEAKER_03]: They'll have to lower their hurdle rate.
[P103] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, that'll show up in the numbers.
[P104] [SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking at every single quarter and you're on top of every single metric of that company, there's yellow flags, red flags along the way.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you can get these things where a company is growing at a really good clip and then it goes through a growth slowdown and then it re-accelerates, right?
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And we've had a case where we've come out of some important names and then gone back into them, right?
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for example, we own Constellation.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: We started buying Constellation at, believe it or not, $20.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: The stock's at, you know, it's almost at $5,000, right?
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's beyond 10 baggers.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: It's beyond 100 baggers.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: It's...
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But we lightened up in the middle because they went through a growth slowdown where they couldn't figure out how to grow much fashion, 10 or 11%.
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: This was back in like 2014, 15, 16.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: So we lightened up.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Then they figured it out and they re-accelerated and now they're consistently growing at 20% a year.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: So we've taken it back to a large position, right?
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: So it does happen.
[P119] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a company...
[P120] [SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple other companies like Edge House is a company that we've had for five years and then we get rid of it because they go through these kind of sprint and then they drift and then they sprint and then they drift.
[P121] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a perfect science.
[P122] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some companies you can just kind of, you buy them and they go forever kind of stuff, but you've got to continually stay on top of them.
[P123] [SPEAKER_01]: And even in the large cap, the largest cap world, like Apple's been a great company for years, but it's not growing anymore.
[P124] [SPEAKER_01]: And at some point, either they're going to have to either have huge innovation because of the scale of the company to get it growing again.
[P125] [SPEAKER_01]: Or it could potentially become the next IBM where it just chugs along sideways.
[P126] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a cash cow.
[P127] [SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of growth there.
[P128] [SPEAKER_01]: So they don't all go on forever.
[P129] [SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they run out of growth for a variety of reasons.
[P130] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just have to be kind of staying on top of it and then saying, okay, Apple's slowing down and it's going to go sideways for a while.
[P131] [SPEAKER_01]: What are my altrues?
[P132] [SPEAKER_01]: And there's always an alternative.
[P133] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P134] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about an interesting term that you used in one of your letters, which was Yarak.
[P135] [SPEAKER_05]: So Yarak refers to a super alert state where the bird is hungry but not weak and it's ready to hunt.
[P136] [SPEAKER_05]: So you wrote about this specifically in the context of staying alert no matter what the market is doing or how successful you've been in the short term.
[P137] [SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is just an excellent concept because it's really easy to get complacent and rest on your laurels in times of peak euphoria.
[P138] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys have had a lot of success throughout the years, not just recently.
[P139] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm just interested in learning, how are you guys maintaining this concept of Yarak in your investing practice?
[P140] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, one is for complacency during good times, but it's also during bad times too, right?
[P141] [SPEAKER_03]: You almost want to go bury your head in the sand.
[P142] [SPEAKER_03]: And Jason says that all the time.
[P143] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like, no, we keep showing up every day because you never know when... We had a couple phenomenal investments last year.
[P144] [SPEAKER_03]: And it's just from showing up, turning over rocks, doing our process, then all of a sudden, you never know when that's going to happen.
[P145] [SPEAKER_03]: Jason and I were actually talking about this yesterday.
[P146] [SPEAKER_03]: You know, we had a couple of great ones and they're like, okay, why are we going to stumble across something?
[P147] [SPEAKER_03]: And we might've started yesterday with, you know, we might be on top of something.
[P148] [SPEAKER_03]: Like you never know what it's going to happen.
[P149] [SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think one is just, we love what we're doing.
[P150] [SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we're showing up and that's what gets us excited is trying to find what is the next best up and coming investment and trying to get there.
[P151] [SPEAKER_03]: So, well, I think it's just, you know, you have to have that mentality maybe within you.
[P152] [SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, Jason, if you, you know, something else about complacency or not.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I've noticed through the bear markets, right?
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: The COVID-driven bear market of 22 was probably the toughest one I've had in my career, right?
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: Because it lasted longer and it was deeper, right?
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: I remember saying to Jesse as kind of a pep talk, don't turn away from the screen.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: They completely engaged through this because when it turns, if you're on top of what's good at that turning point, you will make a fortune off of those companies.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: And so some of those stocks last year were...
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: Within a 12-month period, five, six, seven baggers within a 12-month period because they had become so beaten up in terms of multiple, right?
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, off they went.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And you don't get those in the middle of a cycle or at the end of a cycle.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: Those are usually that first year coming out of the drop.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: You get some spectacular rebounds because people just walk away from stuff and they tune out.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't realize where the value is.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it's a way to keep your concentration going to a bear market because bear markets are hard on the souls.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: They, they, they, if you don't, the people out there don't think we take it personally when the fund is down 3% in a day or something like that, trust me, we go home and that's all we think about for the next 24 hours is the fund was down 3%.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: My clients all think I'm an idiot.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to pull their money.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's the future kind of stuff.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: So, and so the way to get over it is stay focused on what's happening.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: update continuously.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: I know it's painful, but stay engaged every day.
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: So that would be my advice.
[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what we didn't see coming, right?
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see that the supply constraints coming out of COVID was what's going to whack us because we actually were doing okay up until then.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.
[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?
[P186] [SPEAKER_01]: And most of it was multiple compression.
[P187] [SPEAKER_01]: So stocks, growth stocks that were trading, this is using mainly Canadian stocks,
[P188] [SPEAKER_01]: that we're trading on 14 times earnings that we're growing.
[P189] [SPEAKER_01]: By the end of the year, we're trading on five times.
[P190] [SPEAKER_01]: And then guess what?
[P191] [SPEAKER_01]: Last year we were up over a hundred percent.
[P192] [SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of those stocks that we're trading on five times just went back to trading on 12 or 13 times again.
[P193] [SPEAKER_01]: Our average company was not growing 115 or 20% last year.
[P194] [SPEAKER_01]: The huge amount of it was just multiple expansion as interest rates started to come down.
[P195] [SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't see that coming.
[P196] [SPEAKER_01]: And
[P197] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's part of the business that we get it right a lot of the time.
[P198] [SPEAKER_01]: We get it right more often than not.
[P199] [SPEAKER_01]: But in the 17 or 18 years I've been doing this, we've gotten our butts kicked twice in 18 years.
[P200] [SPEAKER_01]: 22 was one of them.
[P201] [SPEAKER_01]: And then that 08, 09 also was pretty tough.
[P202] [SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is that the back half of 09 was so strong that on the annual numbers, it doesn't seem like it.
[P203] [SPEAKER_01]: But if you took the worst six months of the 08, 09 period, same thing.
[P204] [SPEAKER_01]: We're down really, really hard.
[P205] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P206] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you get that resurgence and it kind of makes the year-end numbers look fine.
[P207] [SPEAKER_01]: And therefore people are like, oh, they did all right.
[P208] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P209] [SPEAKER_01]: But if you looked at this at the end of April, if you looked at the April 09 at the bottom of the worst month, right?
[P210] [SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh my God, these guys are idiots.
[P211] [SPEAKER_01]: And you would have concluded the same thing in 22.
[P212] [SPEAKER_01]: And of course, when you've been riding high for a long time, there's a lot of people that quite enjoy watching a guy who's had a pretty good long run, or a couple of guys have a good long run, get their heads handed to him.
[P213] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, it's part of the business.
[P214] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P215] [SPEAKER_03]: And to your point, Kyle, on strategy and did we make poor investments?
[P216] [SPEAKER_03]: If we were looking through our names, so this includes 21, 22, 23, 24, it was 90, I'm going to round the numbers, but it was 95% of all of our top investments had record revenue and record earnings.
[P217] [SPEAKER_03]: Following year, record revenue and record earnings.
[P218] [SPEAKER_03]: Following year, record revenue and record earnings.
[P219] [SPEAKER_03]: So the companies were doing what we said, they're compounding, they're doing
[P220] [SPEAKER_03]: well over that timeframe.
[P221] [SPEAKER_03]: And, and the stocks are declining, like mostly from that, that, that multiple compression as interest rates went up the fastest pace in history.
[P222] [SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[P223] [SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you sit back and you say, well, and we get, you get that question, what do you, what would you have done differently?
[P224] [SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, it's like companies were performed extremely well.
[P225] [SPEAKER_03]: Some of most of them better than we had modeled or even expected.
[P226] [SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[P227] [SPEAKER_03]: So, and then now we own mostly a lot of the same, you know, we kept those investments going and again, they massive rebound last year and they're off to
[P228] [SPEAKER_03]: They look like they're in a phenomenal 2025.
[P229] [SPEAKER_03]: So did we change strategy?
[P230] [SPEAKER_03]: No.
[P231] [SPEAKER_03]: Was there some bad investments that went bankrupt?
[P232] [SPEAKER_03]: No.
[P233] [SPEAKER_03]: It's that timing the market side that we don't think many people or anyone can do, but...
[P234] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll give you an example.
[P235] [SPEAKER_01]: There's a company called VerticalScope, which we own, and it's just been ripping.
[P236] [SPEAKER_01]: We still own it.
[P237] [SPEAKER_01]: It's been ripping, you know, year to date.
[P238] [SPEAKER_01]: I think it's up 17% year to date.
[P239] [SPEAKER_01]: And we still think it's one of the cheapest things that we own.
[P240] [SPEAKER_01]: So this thing, like pre-22, was trading for 30 bucks.
[P241] [SPEAKER_01]: It went to 3%.
[P242] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P243] [SPEAKER_01]: So a year and a half ago in the universe, the first time it was around three, three 50.
[P244] [SPEAKER_01]: It's at 12 bucks right now.
[P245] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's now, so it's gone from 30 to three back up to 12.
[P246] [SPEAKER_01]: It's been growing that whole time.
[P247] [SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I showed, I was on TV a week and a half ago and I said, this is a 25, $30 stock that only presumes it's back to where it was in 21 or 22, but it's been growing that whole time.
[P248] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P249] [SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's, it's, it's, it's the reddit of Canada for lack of a better word.
[P250] [SPEAKER_01]: And it trades on seven times earnings.
[P251] [SPEAKER_01]: I said, this thing should be 14 or 15 times, right?
[P252] [SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, Reddit could acquire these guys at a 50% premium and it would be massively accretive to Reddit kind of thing, right?
[P253] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's not as big as Reddit and it's a different kind of, a little bit different, but it's one, eight per size of Reddit as an acquisition.
[P254] [SPEAKER_01]: It would increase Reddit's earnings and its revenues by 15%.
[P255] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not that small, but it wouldn't be something attractive, right?
[P256] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, this thing went to three from 30.
[P257] [SPEAKER_01]: Now it's back to 12 and a half.
[P258] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think within three or four months, it'll be at 25 or 30.
[P259] [SPEAKER_01]: That's the world we live in.
[P260] [SPEAKER_05]: So with your guys' strategy, obviously, you probably didn't take into account those interest rates and you knew that maybe some of your names would get beaten up.
[P261] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in learning a little bit more about your perspective of that being an institution here who's managing other people's money.
[P262] [SPEAKER_05]: How did your partners feel about that?
[P263] [SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys have just these really good relationships with them so that they understand what you guys are doing and they're okay with taking some of the bumps along the way?
[P264] [SPEAKER_05]: Or yeah, please just expand on that as much as you can.
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: First of all, we weren't ignoring interest rates.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: We were just wrong.
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't think they would go where they were.
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: Because remember, coming into COVID, we're living in a deflationary world, right?
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't that long ago we were talking about negative interest rates.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: European institutions offering you a negative interest rate to hold their currency effectively.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, the hell?
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: You mean I'm going to put my money in a European currency and then I'm going to pay them another half a percent just to hold that currency?
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: That's how crazy it was.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: So we just figured that we'd be back into a deflationary world pretty quickly, right?
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: So our read on, it wasn't that we ignore interest rates.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: We just got it wrong.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: I'll let Jesse kind of finish the answer, but it's always, when you screw up, fold with closure.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: When you got it wrong, just like call a spade.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: Because then you're, you know, people just think, oh my God, the guy smooths over all his mistakes.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't think that interest rates were going to go as high as they did.
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: We got that wrong.
[P282] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P283] [SPEAKER_03]: And Kyle, I know you follow what we write and we put out and that's what we write and put out and speak to our investors.
[P284] [SPEAKER_03]: So to your point, obviously, we're large shareholders in our fund.
[P285] [SPEAKER_03]: So we felt the pain.
[P286] [SPEAKER_03]: So obviously other investors felt the pain.
[P287] [SPEAKER_03]: What we did is we try and just keep our investors on top of what we're doing.
[P288] [SPEAKER_03]: We were very open and honest.
[P289] [SPEAKER_03]: We write
[P290] [SPEAKER_03]: very detailed quarterly reports, monthly commentary saying, this is what we own.
[P291] [SPEAKER_03]: This is what you own.
[P292] [SPEAKER_03]: This is why this is what's happening.
[P293] [SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, at least, you know, educating to a certain degree, I think helps people understand that, you know, we're not a black box and no, you know, these companies aren't going to zero.
[P294] [SPEAKER_03]: So it's that, that type of, and, you know, a lot of the investors have been with us a long time.
[P295] [SPEAKER_03]: They understand,
[P296] [SPEAKER_03]: you know, volatility to a certain degree, and they understand what we own.
[P297] [SPEAKER_03]: So I think that educating investors and, you know, just being open and honest, I think helps, especially in the long term.
[P298] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a quick break and hear from today's sponsors.

[P325] [SPEAKER_05]: All right, back to the show.
[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?
[P330] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me speak to that a little longer.
[P331] [SPEAKER_01]: We've only had a couple of, we've only got really whacked twice, right?
[P332] [SPEAKER_01]: And like I say, in one of them, it was short enough that we got back into the, you know, into the good so fast that a lot of clients almost didn't notice it kind of thing, right?
[P333] [SPEAKER_01]: Or some didn't.
[P334] [SPEAKER_01]: So really, the really only tough one is 22%.
[P335] [SPEAKER_01]: I think now I'll kind of shift to resilience in general.
[P336] [SPEAKER_01]: It comes from a lot of different places.
[P337] [SPEAKER_01]: It comes from how you were raised, the lessons your parents passed on to you, the life experiences that you have through things other than your work.
[P338] [SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's a professional athlete.
[P339] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been involved around athletics a lot of my life.
[P340] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm ex-military, so you learn a little bit of how to be cold and wet and miserable and still manage to get through your day kind of stuff.
[P341] [SPEAKER_01]: So there's different life experiences that build you up to that.
[P342] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think at the end of the day, you know, you, you believe in each other and you're decent people and you just go, yeah, just, it's like that scene in the first gladiator movie where he just gets everybody in the middle of the ring and just sort of says, everybody formed that circle.
[P343] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P344] [SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to just fight this thing together.
[P345] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we did.
[P346] [SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, the team, the team, uh, bought into that and we got through.
[P347] [SPEAKER_01]: Kyle, I don't know if your investors know that Jesse is a hedge fund manager Monday through Friday, but he's a professional athlete on the weekends, right?
[P348] [SPEAKER_01]: And he's also like a CrossFit freak kind of stuff.
[P349] [SPEAKER_01]: So he's super fit and all that kind of stuff, right?
[P350] [SPEAKER_01]: So he's still playing professional lacrosse.
[P351] [SPEAKER_01]: and doing this day job kind of stuff.
[P352] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty impressive because Jesse's not a 25-year-old professional athlete, right?
[P353] [SPEAKER_01]: Part of the reason he's still playing is he's super fit.
[P354] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it speaks a lot to his kind of mental strength and things like that, that he can manage both the portfolio and also be a professional athlete and be that fit at the age that he's at to be able to do that.
[P355] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think that alone tells you a lot about the guy's character and is kind of having his priorities together.
[P356] [SPEAKER_01]: So...
[P357] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I knew, Jesse, that you were a professional lacrosse player, but I didn't know that you were still a professional lacrosse player.
[P358] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you maybe talk about some of your own experiences that have helped build your own resilience?
[P359] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, I would just say, you know, it's sports in general.
[P360] [SPEAKER_03]: You don't always win.
[P361] [SPEAKER_03]: And how do you react to losses?
[P362] [SPEAKER_03]: And to be successful, you obviously have to react in the right way.
[P363] [SPEAKER_03]: I think anyone that's played sports kind of understands that.
[P364] [SPEAKER_03]: But to Jason's point, I think he himself and us did, you know, we circled the wagons well.
[P365] [SPEAKER_03]: And it's that mentality, you know, you could quit, sure.
[P366] [SPEAKER_03]: Or you could kind of do what's right for your firm, your employees and your investors and you battle through.
[P367] [SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it was a hard year, but again, I think we're one year into kind of this next cycle.
[P368] [SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're actually pretty excited, especially what we're seeing out there.
[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?
[P373] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so you definitely saw multiple expansion, right?
[P374] [SPEAKER_03]: We had many, many companies trading on single-digit PE multiples.
[P375] [SPEAKER_03]: Today, we probably have a handful that are still trading on single-digit PE.
[P376] [SPEAKER_03]: So you definitely saw multiple expansion.
[P377] [SPEAKER_03]: You saw earnings growth.
[P378] [SPEAKER_03]: You saw margin expansion for a lot of our names.
[P379] [SPEAKER_03]: We think growth even accelerates this year.
[P380] [SPEAKER_03]: Margins accelerate again.
[P381] [SPEAKER_03]: You won't get the same type of margin expansion because, well, one is that inverse of the interest rates too, right?
[P382] [SPEAKER_03]: So interest rates got cut, but we don't think they got...
[P383] [SPEAKER_03]: you know, at the same pace as maybe, you know, those previous cuts the last few months.
[P384] [SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, so it did play out kind of as expected in the sense of those three factors.
[P385] [SPEAKER_03]: But again, we're not macro, so it's just going through name by name.
[P386] [SPEAKER_03]: And if you're looking at name by name right now, like we're excited, you know, they excite you for 2025, 2026 when, you know, revenue grows there, margin expansions, expansions there.
[P387] [SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, you don't, you don't rely on multiple expansion as much.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: I think, Kyle, though, there was a macro setup at the start of 24 that's worth just briefly re-looking at.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: And there was really three factors at the start of 24 that were really positive.
[P390] [SPEAKER_01]: Valuations were low in the small to mid caps.
[P391] [SPEAKER_01]: The weight of money, people were underweight, the small to mid caps.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: And interest rates had peaked and were coming down, those three things.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: You go to 25 and you sort of say, okay, so let's revisit those three things, right?
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Interest rates now look like they're going to go sideways.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't see... In Canada, they might come down a little bit, but in the States, economy's rocking.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to imagine the interest rates are going to go much lower.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: So people are discussing how many more, one more, two more cuts.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it unless somehow Trump puts pressure on...
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: you know, on the federal reserve, whatever, even though it's supposed to be a non-political organization, let's call it a spade.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: So I just read are going to be neutral as opposed to a positive.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: Valuations are still pretty reasonable in part because the mag seven and the mega caps are pretty expensive.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: And yes, the weight of money is improved a little bit, but people are still relatively underweight because it's been too easy to just hide out in the, in the mag seven or in the ETFs that are dominated by the mag seven.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: So at some point you're going to get a valuation differential.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it'll be good for people like us who are stock pickers in the small to mid-cap area.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: That said, I wouldn't buy the Russell 2000, and that's not a way of diverting people away from me.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: That basket's full of a lot of garbage.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really an asset class.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: If you took Mag7 and just created a bundle together and said it's a single company, it's a rocket ship.
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just expensive, that's all.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: But the earnings and the profits and all the margins are phenomenal.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: You take the 2000 companies in the Russell, it's garbage.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: There are good companies.
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be somebody who can look into that Russell and identify the 10 or 15 that is the way to play small caps and mid caps in America and the same thing in Canada.
[P416] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we actually wrote about that kind of in detail because we were saying, look, this is the largest divergence between large cap and small cap.
[P417] [SPEAKER_03]: So if you believe in reversion to the mean, small cap looks phenomenal, still does extremely phenomenal today.
[P418] [SPEAKER_03]: We broke down the Russell 2000.
[P419] [SPEAKER_03]: And if you want, you know, you want revenue growth, you want earnings growth, you want a profitable business with a decent balance sheet of that name.
[P420] [SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, we wrote about it, we broke it down, but it was like two or 3% of that whole index kind of fits metrics that you would ideally want in a business.
[P421] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's not, you know, if small caps look good and look cheap, you know, there's probably better ways to get there.
[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.
[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.
[P436] [SPEAKER_01]: However,
[P437] [SPEAKER_01]: We also want to look at the companies that are not at 40, but they're rapidly going to 40.
[P438] [SPEAKER_01]: So you actually get more upside from finding a company that's at 20, but you can see, oh my God, last year was a 17, this year it's a 20, next year it'll be a 25.
[P439] [SPEAKER_01]: That's actually the most powerful.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's on its way to becoming one of those, right?
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And typically where you get that is where a company has got consistently high sales growth.
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: So they're growing at 50 to 20% sales, and then they're crossing break even.
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can look at the nature of their business and say, okay, this company should have margins that will go to a certain point, right?
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: But I'll give you an example in our portfolio in contrast with a large American company.
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: So there's a large American company called Doximity, which does software for doctors, right?
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: There's a small version of that company in Canada called VitalHub, which does healthcare software.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: So VitalHub, when we've owned it,
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: Their margins were about 8%, but they were growing at the level of Doximity and maybe even faster, but their margins were at 8% and Doximity was at 40%.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: So we said, if over the next five to seven years, they can move that from eight to 40, the re-rating of the stock will be phenomenal.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: So now, Jesse, what would you say that'll have that now about 25?
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: So they've gone from eight to 25, but there's still another 15 points to get- They still think they can get to 40.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: They think they can get to 40 as well.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's really where you get it.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're looking for that playoff between the margin and the rule of 40, start by looking for the revenue growth.
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you find a company that's just crossing break even, don't freak out that they're on 65 times earnings because that margin, if it goes from even from 2% to 4%, that's 65% times earnings can become 15 times earnings like that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: The better way to measure is if it's priced in as what's the price to sales ratio.
[P458] [SPEAKER_01]: Because you can look and say, okay, a mature rule of 40 company that is trading on a stable valuation, what is a normal price to sales?
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's often 20, 25 times the price to sales multiple for a company like a Doximity.
[P460] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you say, oh, this guy's crossing the break even, it's on 65 times earnings, but it's only on three times sales.
[P461] [SPEAKER_01]: But the margins are coming up quick.
[P462] [SPEAKER_01]: Ignore that PE or cash earnings ratio.
[P463] [SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's, it's just temporary because the following year.
[P464] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P465] [SPEAKER_01]: And you're seeing a lot of companies like, you know, Shopify is going through that rating right now.
[P466] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think the larger names, people like Shopify, even Amazon is starting to become like margins are coming up.
[P467] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P468] [SPEAKER_01]: So, and then we take that same logic and apply it to small and mid-cap companies in our area where you go, wow, look what's happening to the, look what's happening to the margins that's coming over the next three years.
[P469] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, stocks on 45 times this year, right, which seems expensive, but they're growing at 22% a year and the margins are coming really fast.
[P470] [SPEAKER_01]: This thing might be only on seven or eight times three years forward earnings, right?
[P471] [SPEAKER_01]: Now, just what I describe all sounds easy.
[P472] [SPEAKER_01]: You only get a couple of those, like you get two or three of those a year.
[P473] [SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not bad, like they're like a million of those lying around, but that's certainly what we're looking for.
[P474] [SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's a really good segue here into my next question that I want to ask.
[P475] [SPEAKER_05]: So in one of your net letters, you had this really good graph that kind of showed the optimal zone that you guys like to purchase in according to its maturity levels.
[P476] [SPEAKER_05]: So you listed three levels that I like to go over here really quickly.
[P477] [SPEAKER_05]: So stage A was kind of a concept stock, which I guess you guys would probably consider a business that maybe only has rule of 20.
[P478] [SPEAKER_05]: It's not quite there yet.
[P479] [SPEAKER_05]: So these are pre-revenue, maybe unprofitable businesses.
[P480] [SPEAKER_05]: higher failure rates, higher risk, and need for financing.
[P481] [SPEAKER_05]: Then you move into the zone that you guys like to look at, which is
[P482] [SPEAKER_05]: businesses that are high growth, but also profitable, businesses that tend to be overlooked, businesses that have minimal or preferably no analyst coverage, they hopefully are undervalued.
[P483] [SPEAKER_05]: And now they're at a point of maturity where they can self-finance themselves.
[P484] [SPEAKER_05]: And then stage B that you guys wrote here was mature stocks, which are slower growth, but profitable, tons of analyst coverage, stocks that are fully priced and very well-known brands.
[P485] [SPEAKER_05]: And I think you mentioned a couple of them.
[P486] [SPEAKER_05]: Amazon, of course, is one that everyone's going to be familiar with.
[P487] [SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned here that you use that rule of 40 as a benchmark to prepare yourself for businesses that maybe are getting to that zone.
[P488] [SPEAKER_05]: Will you buy ones where you have high conviction that it will go from 20 to 40, or are you generally going to wait for it and get a little more conviction and want to see the business perform and execute at a high level before you eventually make a starter position?
[P489] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I think the best way to answer it is with an example.
[P490] [SPEAKER_03]: So Jason already was just speaking to Vital Hub.
[P491] [SPEAKER_03]: We met, we met with them in our office when they, they were literally just weeks, weeks public.
[P492] [SPEAKER_03]: And they said, this is what we're doing.
[P493] [SPEAKER_03]: This is the idea.
[P494] [SPEAKER_03]: They were just one little piece of software, not profitable, but they had recently just ran, sold a similar business.
[P495] [SPEAKER_03]: Now they were coming off for not competing.
[P496] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're doing it again.
[P497] [SPEAKER_03]: This is the plan.
[P498] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're too early for us, right?
[P499] [SPEAKER_03]: You're unprofitable.
[P500] [SPEAKER_03]: It's not that proven, but no, we like you guys.
[P501] [SPEAKER_03]: We like what you're doing.
[P502] [SPEAKER_03]: It was a few quarters later, they put in a couple other extra pieces of software.
[P503] [SPEAKER_03]: They break profitability and they say, yeah, now they're doing what they said they were going to do.
[P504] [SPEAKER_03]: And so I think we first initially invested with them at around $1.70 and that stocks at 12 bucks today over the last five or six years.
[P505] [SPEAKER_03]: And so that's one where we're meeting with companies all the time.
[P506] [SPEAKER_03]: And that concept A, like you say, that we try and stay away from because like Jason said, you'll get one or two of those that actually come through and you might have to take 50 meetings.
[P507] [SPEAKER_03]: 100 meetings, but at least you're on top of them.
[P508] [SPEAKER_03]: So when you first see those companies breaking the margins you're looking for in the grocery market, you're not starting from scratch.
[P509] [SPEAKER_03]: You're on top of it.
[P510] [SPEAKER_03]: You either like the guys, you don't like the guys, you already have an opinion, and then you can react a lot faster.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: I think that slide that you're talking about, Kyle, it's a nice grappling.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: It shows you the stage in the company's development, right?
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: But I also think you can quantify that a little bit.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: I was reading a report this morning that was looking at 10 baggers in the U.S.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: market.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: And a couple of academics have done this study on 10 baggers, essentially over a decade.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get a stock that's going to go up 1,000% in one decade, what are you looking for?
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: And the guy said, he did a couple of academics, did a big study, and the average
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: The average company that became a 10-bagger, the market cap at the start of that decade or that 10-year period was $3.3 billion.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: So for most Americans, that would not even quite be a mid-cap.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: It would be a small to mid-cap, right?
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, because we're one-tenth the size of the States, we typically take everything in the States and divide it by 10.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: So in Canada, that would be about a $350 million market cap.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's completely consistent with what Jesse and I see as the sweet spot for finding these great companies in Canada is 350 million to about 2.5 billion when they're just coming on the radar screen, but they're fairly liquid.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: You can get time to get to know the management.
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: The stage in the company's history is important, but also the market cap, right?
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: Because it's just the likelihood that Microsoft or Apple, when they get that validated, I think Microsoft's a good buy and hold stock for somebody.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: So I would recommend that as a good, safe company.
[P530] [SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to grow at 12% to 13%.
[P531] [SPEAKER_01]: But if you're looking for that big score, right?
[P532] [SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be down in this, if you're a US investor in that short $3 to $4 billion market cap, of which there's tons of great companies.
[P533] [SPEAKER_01]: And in Canada, same thing, between 250 million and the 3 billion.
[P534] [SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at all of our big winners, most of them are actually even below 350 when we started out, right?
[P535] [SPEAKER_01]: Vital Hub, way below 350.
[P536] [SPEAKER_01]: Zetcore, way below 350.
[P537] [SPEAKER_01]: Enterprise, way below 350.
[P538] [SPEAKER_01]: In fact, some of them are just starting to punch above 350 right now.
[P539] [SPEAKER_01]: But they're not so small you can't buy them.
[P540] [SPEAKER_01]: for somebody who's listening in the States, these aren't like stocks that are so illiquid and so tiny that they don't care because in other markets, a $3 billion company in the States is the equivalent in Canada is a $500 million company as far as activity and that kind of stuff.
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're searching in the mega cabs, you'll find some great companies, but even in this study where they look at all the great companies, the Netflix and all that stuff, they still, the typical 10 bagger is starting at, your starting point is going to be at a market cap of around $3.3 billion.
[P542] [SPEAKER_05]: That's a good study.
[P543] [SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of similar to some of the things that I've come across as well.
[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?
[P550] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not, you might have a good meeting with management, it screens well.
[P551] [SPEAKER_03]: So what we do is we take a total position because it takes a long time for it to be a high conviction name usually, right?
[P552] [SPEAKER_03]: You know, you take that total position, half percent, a 1% weighting, and you've met with management and you've modeled it and everything looks good.
[P553] [SPEAKER_03]: And then another quarter comes out and they're doing what they said they were going to do.
[P554] [SPEAKER_03]: The numbers look good.
[P555] [SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you add to that position and then multiple quarters, multiple years have gone by before it gets to a significant size in the portfolio.
[P556] [SPEAKER_03]: And over those years, you've met management thousands of times and talked to clients and customers and competitors.
[P557] [SPEAKER_03]: And now you're on top of it, right?
[P558] [SPEAKER_03]: It can happen faster than that.
[P559] [SPEAKER_03]: It definitely has happened faster than that.
[P560] [SPEAKER_03]: But I think that also goes to the risk side.
[P561] [SPEAKER_03]: You don't just go out and buy 10% of your fund in a name because you think it's a high conviction name.
[P562] [SPEAKER_03]: But if you've done that much due diligence on it, you should have been starting to accumulate it fairly early on when you saw the green lights that it's potentially there.
[P563] [SPEAKER_03]: So the bottom part of our portfolio, so we're very high concentrated.
[P564] [SPEAKER_03]: So
[P565] [SPEAKER_03]: Top 10, 12 names are 80, 85% of the fund.
[P566] [SPEAKER_03]: But we do have what we kind of refer to as like a farm team below that, right?
[P567] [SPEAKER_03]: These starter positions.
[P568] [SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we hold it for a couple quarters and we boot it out because it isn't what we thought it was.
[P569] [SPEAKER_03]: Or we do grow it over time and hopefully we do.
[P570] [SPEAKER_03]: But that's where the more of the turnover comes from.
[P571] [SPEAKER_03]: But that also is from a risk mitigation standpoint.
[P572] [SPEAKER_03]: You know it well enough by the time it gets to a size that it could really hurt you, right?
[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?
[P585] [SPEAKER_03]: I'll jump on the day-to-day portfolio management.
[P586] [SPEAKER_03]: Jason can touch on it after.
[P587] [SPEAKER_03]: So I'll go back to our stock trackers, right?
[P588] [SPEAKER_03]: So we're trying to compare apples to apples.
[P589] [SPEAKER_03]: So stock A, we own it, it looks good.
[P590] [SPEAKER_03]: And the stock price, and we had one that we literally just sold and it was up 300% over the last 12 months.
[P591] [SPEAKER_03]: So when you rank them and valuation is part of it, it starts to slide down the list, right?
[P592] [SPEAKER_03]: The growth metrics and the profitability are the same, but all of a sudden that one piece that you're using to rank, you know, drives it down the list.
[P593] [SPEAKER_03]: And if you're trying to own the best, you know, dozen, 15 companies that you can own, then why are you owning this thing now?
[P594] [SPEAKER_03]: And it starts to leak down to 20, 30, whatever, right?
[P595] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of like a relative valuation call.
[P596] [SPEAKER_03]: And we've had...
[P597] [SPEAKER_03]: We've had a few of those where, you know, it looks good, but, you know, at three X evaluation, maybe, you know, other things look better.
[P598] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's the relative side.
[P599] [SPEAKER_03]: Jason, do you have kind of other valuation?
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: No, I just, cause in Canada,
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't get much over 25 times in terms of what we own.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: As far as 25 times earnings would be something that's fairly expensive, right?
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in the States, which is a high quality company, it's hard to find anything below 25 times.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: So it really, it's only just with the U.S.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: stocks where we have to sort of say, okay, relative to the U.S.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: market, this is actually attractive.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to live with it.
[P608] [SPEAKER_01]: I think I can live with a little bit more multiple value, a higher valuation than Jesse.
[P609] [SPEAKER_01]: I think Jesse's got a little bit more of a value bent than I do.
[P610] [SPEAKER_01]: So once you get over 25 times, it is a judgment call.
[P611] [SPEAKER_01]: The key thing is if you're taking money out of a stock that's growing quickly, but it's on 30 times, as long as you're not putting in cash, but you're putting in something else that's growing, you're probably going to be okay.
[P612] [SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes when we sell something, the people, oh my God, you sold it.
[P613] [SPEAKER_01]: And then it subsequently went up another 20 or 30%.
[P614] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't assume that we didn't put it into something else.
[P615] [SPEAKER_01]: It didn't do well as well.
[P616] [SPEAKER_03]: And, and then Kyle, like, like you say, like, you know, when you see it, so, you know, a company growing at 30% with 30% margins and trading, you know, it can trade a much higher multiple than something growing at 20% with 20% margins.
[P617] [SPEAKER_03]: Like you're, you're, you're willing to pay a different multiple.
[P618] [SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of where that ranking kind of factors it all in, like how much growth
[P619] [SPEAKER_03]: Are you getting per unit of PE?
[P620] [SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, there's more qualitative stuff there too, right?
[P621] [SPEAKER_03]: Are you comfortable with how recurring and safe the growth is going forward?
[P622] [SPEAKER_03]: Or could a lumpy quarter come out of nowhere?
[P623] [SPEAKER_03]: And if a lumpy quarter can come out of nowhere and suddenly straight out 50 times, it can go back.
[P624] [SPEAKER_03]: It can go trade on 20 times pretty quick, which was hurt, right?
[P625] [SPEAKER_03]: So versus if you're more secure and they're more diversified or more locked in recurring,
[P626] [SPEAKER_03]: then maybe you're willing to pay a little bit more because you know that bad quarter is not coming around the corner.

[P662] [SPEAKER_05]: All right, back to the show.
[P663] [SPEAKER_05]: So tell me a little bit more about that ranking system.
[P664] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think I've probably seen it on your, at least on, sometimes you do have a list of 10 to 15 stocks and you'll have revenue growth, earnings growth, and then the price to earnings for the future growth.
[P665] [SPEAKER_05]: Is that kind of how you're constantly evaluating these businesses over the next quarters or years or whatever?
[P666] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P667] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P668] [SPEAKER_03]: Jason usually says like, you know, he goes mirror, mirror on the wall, what looks, you know, what's prettiest of them all today type of thing.
[P669] [SPEAKER_03]: But it does, it kind of breaks down into a single number, right?
[P670] [SPEAKER_03]: So you can, it's a bit more complicated than that, but you know, how much, how much revenue growth or earnings growth are you getting per unit of PE that you're paying for?
[P671] [SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a reverse peg, right?
[P672] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P673] [SPEAKER_03]: And again, we're not making investment decisions strictly based off this number, but it gives you a starting position.
[P674] [SPEAKER_03]: There's companies that rank high on that, that we don't know for one reason or another, right?
[P675] [SPEAKER_03]: Debt or not liking management or et cetera, right?
[P676] [SPEAKER_03]: So the rankings, a starting position is something ramping up the list.
[P677] [SPEAKER_03]: then we better be on top of it.
[P678] [SPEAKER_03]: If something's dropping down a list, we better be on top of it.
[P679] [SPEAKER_03]: That's where it starts.
[P680] [SPEAKER_03]: But again, there's modeling, meeting with management, talking to whoever we need to to kind of get comfortable.
[P681] [SPEAKER_03]: So it's more of a starting point.
[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?
[P686] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, one, I'd say every company is different, right?
[P687] [SPEAKER_03]: You can't just say, we look for this.
[P688] [SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.
[P689] [SPEAKER_03]: But I'll go back to that point of if competitive pressure starts to happen, you see it.
[P690] [SPEAKER_03]: You see it in growth numbers.
[P691] [SPEAKER_03]: You see it in margins.
[P692] [SPEAKER_03]: It shows up, right?
[P693] [SPEAKER_03]: Or you see it because you should be out there talking with competitors and customers.
[P694] [SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say there's something that smacks you in the face.
[P695] [SPEAKER_03]: But like, you're definitely looking for it, but, and then on the other point I'll go to when you're talking about, you know, long-term compounders and ability to reinvest at high rates is we, and I think it might've been day one, I started working with Jason.
[P696] [SPEAKER_03]: He's like, every company is a P type Q in some form or another it's price time quantity.
[P697] [SPEAKER_03]: which I refer to as the unit economics of the business.
[P698] [SPEAKER_03]: So break the business down.
[P699] [SPEAKER_03]: How much does it cost for them to make that?
[P700] [SPEAKER_03]: How much are they getting for it?
[P701] [SPEAKER_03]: Is that good?
[P702] [SPEAKER_03]: We have some companies that have phenomenal IRRs right now.
[P703] [SPEAKER_03]: Something costs them $30,000 to make, and they make $15,000 a year off of it, and it can last 10, 15 years.
[P704] [SPEAKER_03]: That's a phenomenal IRR.
[P705] [SPEAKER_03]: And if they can keep
[P706] [SPEAKER_03]: throwing money back into that, reinvesting back into that.
[P707] [SPEAKER_03]: And then, like you said, there's a long enough runway for growth.
[P708] [SPEAKER_03]: That's a compounder, right?
[P709] [SPEAKER_03]: So union economics is very important.
[P710] [SPEAKER_03]: How much did it cost?
[P711] [SPEAKER_03]: How much does it make?
[P712] [SPEAKER_03]: Can you replicate that over time?
[P713] [SPEAKER_03]: That's definitely our starting position, at least.
[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?
[P722] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it because you don't like the fundamentals of the businesses?
[P723] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it just like you think Constellation's just better because you got Mark Leonard?
[P724] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it a matter of evaluation?
[P725] [SPEAKER_05]: Or yeah, just please go ahead.
[P726] [SPEAKER_03]: Jason, you probably have your stock tracker in front of you, or if you want to refer to the.
[P727] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P728] [SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you talk about it?
[P729] [SPEAKER_01]: I can bring up the numbers as far as how, how the valuations look, but yeah.
[P730] [SPEAKER_03]: So we, obviously we got the spin out, so we did own them.
[P731] [SPEAKER_03]: So, um, we owned the mine for a while and for a bit, they're kind of traded to a higher valuation than Constellation.
[P732] [SPEAKER_03]: So again, it's when you run a concentrated fund, so it's not like we need to, we need to own all three, we could own all three.
[P733] [SPEAKER_03]: But again, when we go to that ranking process, one, Constellation still ranks well, but two, by owning Constellation, you get the upside of further spin-outs, right?
[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.
[P741] [SPEAKER_01]: So there's a big valuation differential there.
[P742] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why that differential is.
[P743] [SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think for Jesse, remember I said to you that I can live with a little bit more evaluations, but we tend to get, our big positions are one that we both like at that price.
[P744] [SPEAKER_01]: I would suspect that if either Lumine or Totopagus was to come back closer to 25 times, I think that Jesse would be more open to it.
[P745] [SPEAKER_01]: My feeling, and I don't think we're in disagreement with this, it's just where our comfort level is evaluation is that if you can find a compounder that's growing at 20% a year for the next 10 years,
[P746] [SPEAKER_01]: Whether you pay 20, 25, 30 times, the compounding effect will make you a winner.
[P747] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think if anybody's listening in on this, I would be very comfortable holding any of those three stocks.
[P748] [SPEAKER_01]: In the present moment, though, consolation is cheaper.
[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.
[P758] [SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I would just like to get your views on what you're kind of seeing today.
[P759] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you kind of mentioned interest rates and where you think they're headed.
[P760] [SPEAKER_05]: You think maybe they're in kind of this neutral zone.
[P761] [SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, how do you see that playing out maybe next year and into the future?
[P762] [SPEAKER_05]: And you're obviously still very, very bullish.
[P763] [SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, please go ahead and riff on that.
[P764] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P765] [SPEAKER_03]: So again, we're not macro investors, but I have a pretty strong opinion.
[P766] [SPEAKER_03]: But what I would say is, I think pre-COVID, so before COVID happened, interest rates had been declining for a long time.
[P767] [SPEAKER_03]: And like Jason said earlier, we were facing deviation.
[P768] [SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[P769] [SPEAKER_03]: What's changed?
[P770] [SPEAKER_03]: COVID happened, supply issues, and they pump money into the economy.
[P771] [SPEAKER_03]: And there was that spike and we're coming back down.
[P772] [SPEAKER_03]: But has anything else changed structurally from interest rates coming down and going more towards deflation?
[P773] [SPEAKER_03]: Because guess what?
[P774] [SPEAKER_03]: Demographics are massively deflationary right now.
[P775] [SPEAKER_03]: I had some stats because we're doing some writing right now.
[P776] [SPEAKER_03]: The population growth on average the last five years has been 0.7.
[P777] [SPEAKER_03]: But then people refer, I think a lot of people get stuck thinking of the 60s and 70s and 70s of those interest rates.
[P778] [SPEAKER_03]: But the population growth was almost 2x, almost 3x the population growth it is now.
[P779] [SPEAKER_03]: And we're heading towards literally declining demographics.
[P780] [SPEAKER_03]: I think China is declining year over year.
[P781] [SPEAKER_03]: And based on current birth rates, our population, it will end up start declining.
[P782] [SPEAKER_03]: That's deflationary.
[P783] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's that side to it.
[P784] [SPEAKER_03]: The one is the money printing.
[P785] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, the government was running money for the decade heading into COVID too.
[P786] [SPEAKER_03]: And again, we were facing deflation.
[P787] [SPEAKER_03]: And then another one is productivity.
[P788] [SPEAKER_03]: We haven't really talked about AI, but AI is, we're not even out of the dugout yet.
[P789] [SPEAKER_03]: And you're starting to see massive productivity gains.
[P790] [SPEAKER_03]: And if people get forced to return to the office, like Jason and I were speaking about today, the amount of government workers that...
[P791] [SPEAKER_03]: You need two extra government workers to do the same amount of work now because they're not getting anything done.
[P792] [SPEAKER_03]: And so increased productivity is deflationary.
[P793] [SPEAKER_03]: So you start going through these things and you're like, well, that just kind of looked like what it was.
[P794] [SPEAKER_03]: And again, I think you can find studies about this.
[P795] [SPEAKER_03]: What is the long-term interest rate over the last 300 years?
[P796] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like between one and 2%.
[P797] [SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[P798] [SPEAKER_03]: So I think a lot of people get stuck in the seventies and the eighties, but that was an aberration.
[P799] [SPEAKER_03]: Like you were going through a massive demographic explosion, massive inflationary explosion that's behind us.
[P800] [SPEAKER_03]: But I think a lot of people's minds, especially if they grew up in that timeframe and they, you know, they had to have a mortgage at 18%, like that's stuck in their mind.
[P801] [SPEAKER_03]: All that to say is I don't see a massive spike back in inflation, which is what we have faced in 2022.
[P802] [SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of that was the supply side.
[P803] [SPEAKER_03]: So I have a strong opinion on no massive spike back in inflation and no massive, which means no massive increase in interest rates.
[P804] [SPEAKER_03]: Interest rates are still higher than the nominal growth rate, which means they're still slowing the economy.
[P805] [SPEAKER_03]: So
[P806] [SPEAKER_03]: That's my opinion.
[P807] [SPEAKER_03]: That's more in the US.
[P808] [SPEAKER_03]: Again, Canada is weaker than the US.
[P809] [SPEAKER_03]: So the Canadian rates probably do drop, continue to drop, but that's probably a long winded answer to macro, which we're spending a lot more of our time on companies.
[P810] [SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know how helpful that is.
[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?
[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.
[P822] [SPEAKER_03]: And we wrote about it and listeners can kind of go on our website and
[P823] [SPEAKER_03]: and pull it up.
[P824] [SPEAKER_03]: But like anything, there's a lot of hype.
[P825] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of trash.
[P826] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of speculation.
[P827] [SPEAKER_03]: And we're trying not to get pulled into any of that.
[P828] [SPEAKER_03]: We're saying, what are you using it for?
[P829] [SPEAKER_03]: Are you actually seeing results?
[P830] [SPEAKER_03]: And we're not investing in AI companies per se, right?
[P831] [SPEAKER_03]: Smart management teams find the best tools to improve their business.
[P832] [SPEAKER_03]: And if they're seeing it as a tool,
[P833] [SPEAKER_03]: and they're improving their business, that's what we're already seeing happen to a decent scale.
[P834] [SPEAKER_03]: Jason, do you want to jump in on AI there?
[P835] [SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[P836] [SPEAKER_01]: Not much more to add other than that AI is already pretty much everywhere.
[P837] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're using a software as a corporation to deal with clients, manage efficiency, whatever, there's AI components and all that stuff now, right?
[P838] [SPEAKER_01]: So yes, there are some companies in our portfolio like Propel that's more pure AI where they have 12 guys from Stanford with PhDs working in the company kind of thing.
[P839] [SPEAKER_01]: So we got some stuff that's really AI, but it's in everything right now.
[P840] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P841] [SPEAKER_03]: And then the other side of where we do spend time is, you know, what's, you know, if AI does go the way, like does have the growth that it looks like it will, you know, obviously there's going to be massive energy needs.
[P842] [SPEAKER_03]: Where does that energy come from?
[P843] [SPEAKER_03]: Is that sustainable?
[P844] [SPEAKER_03]: So then you talk about, you know, building data centers or most of them will be powered by natural gas and you start.
[P845] [SPEAKER_03]: So then you do kind of, we don't, we don't invest in sectors like, oh, you like this sector.
[P846] [SPEAKER_03]: But when things are, things are booming in a sector, you can usually go in and find a really great company that's operating there.
[P847] [SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[P848] [SPEAKER_03]: So.
[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.
[P855] [SPEAKER_01]: The growth comes from the new, new things.
[P856] [SPEAKER_01]: And we live in a knowledge-based economy and that's where the opportunity is, right?
[P857] [SPEAKER_01]: So, and if you earn the knowledge-based, if you're focusing on the knowledge-based end of the economy, then you're running into AI everywhere.
[P858] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just in the obvious stuff.
[P859] [SPEAKER_01]: It's in, you know, we've got, you know, companies like, you know, that do healthcare stuff, right?
[P860] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, AI is a big player in healthcare on a whole bunch of different levels, right?
[P861] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's in, it's in security tech, people, you know, trying to keep buildings and facilities safe.
[P862] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it's in commercial lending, but it's also in sourcing clients, right?
[P863] [SPEAKER_01]: Finding people, adjudicating risk.
[P864] [SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere and it's expanding margins.
[P865] [SPEAKER_01]: It's accelerating growth.
[P866] [SPEAKER_01]: It's dividing, you know, we see it, you know, we know a couple or we have investments in a couple of...
[P867] [SPEAKER_01]: online lenders or you know um what do you call it like um you want to call them subprime but they're they're they're not doing they're not banks that are lending kind of stuff that have got ai tools and we see what their growth rate is and then we know you know in in toronto people that are doing lending that are not doing it that way and the ones that are not doing it that way are not growing at all maybe they're even contracting slightly and the two that we own that are public are growing at 30 to 50 percent a year and you kind of go
[P868] [SPEAKER_01]: I think there might be a bit of a market share thing happening here, and it's the guys that are technologically sophisticated that seem to be growing really fast, and the old school guys, and they have a million different reasons to say why, oh yeah, AI can't do this or whatever, right?
[P869] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's crazy.
[P870] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, before you know it, they're going to be thinking that they're going to be able to sell books like through the internet or something like that, right?
[P871] [SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[P872] [SPEAKER_05]: It is what it is.
[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?
[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So
[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.
[P889] [SPEAKER_03]: But speaking about cash,
[P890] [SPEAKER_03]: We refer to the money market funds, but then also listen to the American bank CEOs, their clients across the board on the low end and the high end have never had so much cash as sitting in their bank accounts.
[P891] [SPEAKER_03]: You know, they got, they had COVID payouts and they saved most of it.
[P892] [SPEAKER_03]: And then so they're, you know, you're sitting, you're hearing
[P893] [SPEAKER_03]: with Bank of America, and he's going through all the cohorts.
[P894] [SPEAKER_03]: And he said, this cohort used to have $200 to $300 in the Rick account.
[P895] [SPEAKER_03]: They have $1,200 to $2,000 now.
[P896] [SPEAKER_03]: That's fairly significant in the sense of being a fairly defensible market.
[P897] [SPEAKER_03]: But we don't spend too much time on that.
[P898] [SPEAKER_03]: It's just an interesting pattern that we've seen.
[P899] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason and Jesse, thank you so much for coming onto the show and sharing your insights with me and my audience.
[P900] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd love to give you a handoff and let you tell the audience where they can learn more about you.
[P901] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll jump in and then let Jason finish.
[P902] [SPEAKER_03]: But we write a quarterly newsletter and monthly commentaries that goes to our clients, but anyone can receive it.
[P903] [SPEAKER_03]: So if you go to our website, donvillekent.com, you can sign up.
[P904] [SPEAKER_03]: And we just, we write about similar conversations like we had today.
[P905] [SPEAKER_03]: But Jason, I'll hand it over to you.
[P906] [SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are skeptical.
[P907] [SPEAKER_01]: We just let people read our newsletter.
[P908] [SPEAKER_01]: Just realize that when we talk about companies, we already own them.
[P909] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're not going to tell you about the company that we're just about to invest in tomorrow.
[P910] [SPEAKER_01]: But once we're in, someone says, what's in there for us?
[P911] [SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to share our ideas and engage.
[P912] [SPEAKER_01]: Part of the discovery process is we've found this really great company.
[P913] [SPEAKER_01]: There's still a lot of upside.
[P914] [SPEAKER_01]: We already got our piece, but there's still lots of upside for you guys, so have a look.
[P915] [SPEAKER_01]: And Jesse does most of the writing of the newsletter now, and I think, you know, it's very well received.
[P916] [SPEAKER_01]: People like it.
[P917] [SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of ideas and...
[P918] [SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a, it's kind of a fresh look at the market and a lot of companies that are not, people have already got a lot of exposure to Microsoft and Apple.
[P919] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of companies that go, wow, these are kind of interesting companies, you know, but I haven't heard of them before.
[P920] [SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[P921] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you really want to learn about us, the newsletter is the best place to go.
[P922] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to TIP.

[P1] [SPEAKER_01]: Brought to you by the EveryDollar app.
[P2] [SPEAKER_01]: Start budgeting for free today.
[P3] [SPEAKER_00]: How do I insulate and separate myself from my husband who has a massive spending addiction?
[P4] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[P5] [SPEAKER_01]: Can you describe that briefly to us?
[P6] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's super easy.
[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: He spends and spends and spends.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: He has had to empty his 401k three times to pay off debt that he has accrued.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: He takes out consolidation loans without my consent.
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: He bought a car without my consent.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The payment for that is almost $1,000 a month.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[P14] [SPEAKER_00]: And it just goes and goes and goes.
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: How long has this been happening?
[P16] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, years.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: And this entire time, you have always said, stop doing this.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in favor of this.
[P19] [SPEAKER_01]: This scares me.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: He has no concept of it.

[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: $9,608.14 in investment saved.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: And I have $6,005.43 left in debt, like on credit cards.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: Pay off your debt today with the money you have.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[P37] [SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any debt that's in your name beyond that, or is the rest in his name only?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: The rest is only in his name.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be his problem.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: My fear is always the stuff that he's buying, like cars and all this stuff, because they were obtained during marriage.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get stuck with these?
[P43] [SPEAKER_02]: Your name's not on there, so you're not going to be liable for that loan.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[P45] [SPEAKER_02]: So here's the deal.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: You've already separated finances.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: This is heading clearly towards divorce because I can't.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Does he know this?
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: It's so unsustainable.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: I've already explained this to him.
[P51] [SPEAKER_02]: Is he in La La Land?
[P52] [SPEAKER_02]: Like, does he shut down when you bring any of this up?
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: He thinks that because he is the breadwinner and he makes all the money and because I'm on disability that he should be able to spend whatever he wants whenever he wants.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: And I...
[P57] [SPEAKER_02]: So he doesn't understand that his decisions affect you financially, emotionally, maritally.
[P58] [SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[P59] [SPEAKER_02]: He's made that very clear on where he stands, and he's not going to change.
[P60] [SPEAKER_01]: He's not participating in therapy.
[P61] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think we've got some real clear gates that you have walked through here, and I think certainly separation is of order here to see if there's a wake-up call.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through therapy.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing therapy, so this is not like...
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: I need to go to therapy.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: I need to like.
[P66] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: But I was when I asked that question, I was talking about you two as a couple to see if we've actually fought for this.
[P71] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P72] [SPEAKER_00]: And you can't do it for him.
[P73] [SPEAKER_01]: I know you can't do it for him.
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's to the, you know, that whole you can lead a horse to water.
[P75] [SPEAKER_01]: Can't make him drink.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: So I just been trying to figure out like, how do I separate and insulate myself from that?
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: And then with what I have saved and what I have like investment wise, like in theory, I know that a judge or whatever would maybe do some type of spousal support, but I know that's not guaranteed and it's not for forever.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: But I have an income of $1,054 a month from disability.
[P79] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's my question.
[P80] [SPEAKER_01]: Does your disability prohibit you from being able to make a steady income?
[P81] [SPEAKER_00]: I think I can make like...
[P82] [SPEAKER_00]: $600 a month or something.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Because you'll lose the disability payment?
[P85] [SPEAKER_01]: Disability.
[P86] [SPEAKER_01]: How much is the disability payment?
[P87] [SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[P88] [SPEAKER_01]: But you missed my question, Jessica.
[P89] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying, is there an end to this physical challenge that you will be able to get through through medical care?
[P90] [SPEAKER_01]: Or is this a, I'm trying to understand what you can actually do.
[P91] [SPEAKER_01]: Forget the benefit payment.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: It's permanent disability.
[P94] [SPEAKER_01]: So you are unable to work from home, do a remote job, and work 40 hours a week.
[P95] [SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[P97] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P98] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I wanted to understand.
[P99] [SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to, this is George, this is a fixed and a very low fixed income.
[P100] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: I've had five separate spine surgeries, like just that part of me.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sorry.
[P104] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a mess.
[P105] [SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Jessica.
[P106] [SPEAKER_00]: And I've accepted that, but.
[P107] [SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could have my rose-colored glasses on and tell you the three steps to solving all of this.
[P108] [SPEAKER_02]: I can't change people.
[P109] [SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a magic wand.
[P110] [SPEAKER_02]: And so if you've made it very clear of, hey, this is what it's going to take for this marriage to work, and he's unable to fulfill that, I would be talking to an attorney and figuring out how do I at least protect myself?
[P111] [SPEAKER_02]: How do I begin a phase of separation so that you don't get dragged down with him?
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say, Jessica, George told you, I hope you caught it.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: pay off the debt today, your debt.
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and do that.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: I know that cash is very attractive sitting in that savings account, but one of the best things you can do to protect yourself on a very low fixed income is to have no debt.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad she has that, right, George?
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what we want.
[P119] [SPEAKER_01]: Saving grace.
[P120] [SPEAKER_01]: Quickly.
[P121] [SPEAKER_02]: Get that out now before your brain talks you out of it.
[P122] [SPEAKER_02]: Reduces your expenses so that you're going to be able to hopefully survive off of your fixed income, even if there isn't spousal support.
[P123] [SPEAKER_02]: That's where I would go sit down and make a budget for yourself based on here's what my expenses would be if I was doing this on my own.
[P124] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man, I'm so sorry.
[P125] [SPEAKER_01]: Tough, tough call.
[P126] [SPEAKER_01]: Create your free every dollar budget today.
[P127] [SPEAKER_01]: The simplest way to budget for your life.

[P1] [SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast, powered by Turnkey Coach, where we help business owners find freedom over fear.
[P2] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matt Reynolds.
[P3] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm his brother, Chris Reynolds.
[P4] [SPEAKER_00]: Join us as we help build your business and move from fear to freedom together.
[P5] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast.
[P6] [SPEAKER_00]: We are your hosts, Matt Reynolds and Chris Reynolds.
[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, sir.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: We are going to dive right in as we usually do.
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.
[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.
[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.
[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.
[P655] [SPEAKER_00]: The goals, actions, metrics, and execution, and really the execution is the SOP.
[P656] [SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the teaser for next episode or next couple episodes coming up.
[P657] [SPEAKER_00]: That's another episode of the Build Your Business podcast with Matt and Chris Reynolds.
[P658] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, things are going great.
[P659] [SPEAKER_00]: Rankings are awesome.
[P660] [SPEAKER_00]: Would love for you to share this with a friend or family member.
[P661] [SPEAKER_00]: Five-star review or honest review anywhere you listen to your podcast.
[P662] [SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody about it.
[P663] [SPEAKER_00]: Share it on social media.
[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

[P1] [SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast, powered by Turnkey Coach, where we help business owners find freedom over fear.
[P2] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matt Reynolds.
[P3] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm his brother, Chris Reynolds.
[P4] [SPEAKER_00]: Join us as we help build your business and move from fear to freedom together.
[P5] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast.
[P6] [SPEAKER_00]: We are your hosts, Matt Reynolds and Chris Reynolds.
[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, sir.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: We are going to dive right in as we usually do.
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.
[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.
[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.
[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.
[P655] [SPEAKER_00]: The goals, actions, metrics, and execution, and really the execution is the SOP.
[P656] [SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the teaser for next episode or next couple episodes coming up.
[P657] [SPEAKER_00]: That's another episode of the Build Your Business podcast with Matt and Chris Reynolds.
[P658] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, things are going great.
[P659] [SPEAKER_00]: Rankings are awesome.
[P660] [SPEAKER_00]: Would love for you to share this with a friend or family member.
[P661] [SPEAKER_00]: Five-star review or honest review anywhere you listen to your podcast.
[P662] [SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody about it.
[P663] [SPEAKER_00]: Share it on social media.
[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

[P1] [SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast, powered by Turnkey Coach, where we help business owners find freedom over fear.
[P2] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matt Reynolds.
[P3] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm his brother, Chris Reynolds.
[P4] [SPEAKER_00]: Join us as we help build your business and move from fear to freedom together.
[P5] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast.
[P6] [SPEAKER_00]: We are your hosts, Matt Reynolds and Chris Reynolds.
[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, sir.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: We are going to dive right in as we usually do.
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about systems and standard operating procedures.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting topic there is to talk about.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Writing technical manuals for your business.
[P14] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the twist on this one is that it's exciting for people who are in the middle of chaos because it is the route out, right?
[P15] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great...
[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: topic to go through, especially at this point in the year.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: I think most people have sort of started to kick off their, you know, 25, 2025 critical projects, and you're probably already starting to swim in a little bit of chaos.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a great topic for us to hit and go over how we deal with it.
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just got back from Washington State meeting with my
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: My executive team or we lay out the 2025 strategic game plan for the company and all of that sort of strategy deployment.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: And that really is what filters down into writing systems and stops for this year that maybe aren't written yet.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just dive into what they are first.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: Those words are often used interchangeable.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly the same, but a system or a SOP, which stands for a standard operating procedure.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: I was first exposed to this via the E-Myth, and we've talked about the E-Myth, so we won't go into great detail about the E-Myth, although I think it's a great reference book.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who haven't done this before, that's probably the best book to start with.
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a playbook.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: A system or a SOP is just a, it's often as simple as a step-by-step checklist for how to do a thing.
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody's actually familiar with this because you use this on a daily basis, maybe just not in the business.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a recipe, a well-written recipe,
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: is a SOP.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to cook this thing.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how to bake this pie.
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what ingredients do I need?
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: What are the things I'm looking for for metrics?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the pie crust turns lightly brown and maybe has an internal temperature of X, then those are the metrics, right?
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that same thing.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look at instruction manuals for we are we are going to the Arnold this year to the Arnold Classic Arnold Expo convention.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: And we're big sponsors there.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we bought a bunch of furniture, IKEA furniture.
[P43] [SPEAKER_00]: A system is just like opening up the box of IKEA furniture with 10,000 pieces and following the instructions step by step until you have a piece of furniture that's put together.
[P44] [SPEAKER_00]: That is a system or a SOP that IKEA has written for people.
[P45] [SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's lots of they're not always super easy to follow.
[P46] [SPEAKER_00]: The key here is made as easy to follow as possible.
[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: And as this podcast comes out, this is Super Bowl weekend.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has seen the coach on the sideline with the nine by 13 piece of paper that's laminated.
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: That's their game plan.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[P51] [SPEAKER_00]: That is their playbook for what they're going to use over the course of the game.
[P52] [SPEAKER_00]: They're marking on it.
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: They're writing on it.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: They go back to halftime.
[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: They make tweaks and changes.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: They probably print out a new sheet with those edits made and walk out into the second half and do the same thing.
[P57] [SPEAKER_00]: hone this even with my kids, and I think I've talked about this before, is my kids, their entire lives have had a chore checklist.
[P58] [SPEAKER_00]: The things that they do to get paid.
[P59] [SPEAKER_00]: So things beyond what is expected of them, like keeping the room clean and laundry done and whatnot.
[P60] [SPEAKER_00]: But the cleaning of the kitchen or the work around the house, we've got tons of trees in our yard, picking up the sticks after the storm, things like that is on literally a step-by-step in chronological order
[P61] [SPEAKER_00]: checklist.
[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing for our sister who works for me a lot.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: She shows up every day.
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: There's a notepad on the iPhone that I can share with her.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: This got her checklist in chronological order of how I want it completed.
[P66] [SPEAKER_00]: That is the simplest version of a SOP or standard operating procedure that I think a lot of us use on some level every single day.
[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P68] [SPEAKER_01]: What you get, I think, when you talk to people about this, and especially with entrepreneurs or founders who are
[P69] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe skeptical of systems, skeptical of this idea that you could build checklists, you can turn these things into systems that operate without you, is this idea that you bring some unique magic to the game every time that you're doing it, and it isn't so black and white as a checklist.
[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: The reality is there are a lot of things that are that way.
[P71] [SPEAKER_01]: But those things are things that are not yet ready for you to turn into a checklist in some circumstances.
[P72] [SPEAKER_01]: And in some circumstances, you're actually just wrong and you could absolutely turn them into a checklist.
[P73] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a transition period, I think, where you often turn in the work that you have to do as a founder
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: or an owner into a SOP that then you are the manager of that SOP, you follow the SOP, you tweak the SOP, but eventually the day will come, you will give that away as well, right?
[P75] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to do is start, as we start to write systems and standard operating procedures in our business, we want to start with the simplest task at hand.
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you can get the easy win on, you've talked about before, if you can sit down and write a SOP in five minutes,
[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you should start with.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the most important one.
[P79] [SPEAKER_00]: It's the simplest.
[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that Dave Ramsey, like whatever credit card you have the least balance on, even if it's got a higher, you know, lower interest rate, you still pay that one off first because we're looking for easy wins here.
[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: It's a snowball, right?
[P82] [SPEAKER_01]: Snowball concept.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Start small and grow that thing bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[P85] [SPEAKER_00]: We have read a lot of books on this and we'll give some notes.
[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, I talked about the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
[P87] [SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Amazon.
[P88] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a bestselling book.
[P89] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's that introduction into systems and standard operating procedures.
[P90] [SPEAKER_00]: And again, coming back to what you just said, I think that the problem that most founders have that certainly I had and I think you have had in the past as well is that
[P91] [SPEAKER_00]: Most founders, you start this business, it's your baby, and you have on some level superhero mentality.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I can do all of it better than everyone else.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for a time.
[P94] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that if you continue to do that, you spend your entire life drowning in the business and not working on the business.
[P95] [SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, you have to be able to trust people enough
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: to train them up, to write the system, write the SOP, give it away, train them in their first few weeks of using that SOP, and then it becomes theirs.
[P97] [SPEAKER_00]: They have ownership of it.
[P98] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to tweak it.
[P99] [SPEAKER_00]: Their job is to make it better.
[P100] [SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people in the early years, you might go from employee of one to an employee of five, let's say, or three to five employees.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: That eventually grows to 20, which means each one of those people then are writing SOPs
[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: they're passing down to the people that direct report up to them as well.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: And so this system works because this is really the only way you can scale your business long-term is through a series, a very systematic, logical progression of systems and standard operating procedures.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P105] [SPEAKER_01]: And actually, so I have not only heard it, but I have felt it myself, this idea that no one can do it better than me.
[P106] [SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of your startup, of your business, whatever, is really based on you.
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: You set that quality bar for your company.
[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for your employees.
[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: You set it for everyone.
[P110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the primary role of a CEO is to do this.
[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of the hats that you're wearing as a founder is CEO, then one of the main things that you are supposed to do is set the quality bar for your company.
[P112] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting piece here, which is that while you are the best, probably, certainly at the beginning,
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: at all of these things, at the technician tasks, we've talked about the technician role before, there is actually a moment where you are not.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: And that moment when you are not isn't even when you are the least, when you are no longer the most capable of being that.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's when you start missing meetings.
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start being the bottleneck.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: I would actually say that most founders...
[P119] [SPEAKER_00]: dive into this idea of systems when the current systems are breaking and the current systems are it's all in your head and you're doing all the work yeah and it turns into that feeling of chaos that you were talking about that's exactly right it's just chaos i can't get my head above water i'm drowning in this urgency and that's a lot of what my book is about of undoing urgency and so that's that's certainly a place i think
[P120] [SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that the listeners this week will hear this and will make these changes before they get to that point, before they get to utter chaos, right?
[P121] [SPEAKER_00]: And so some other books that we've read that are great.
[P122] [SPEAKER_00]: Peter Drucker actually has a handful of books, but you mentioned management is by objective or MBO, the practice of management.
[P123] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker also is famous for his effective executive book.
[P124] [SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to come sometimes a little further down the road.
[P125] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little more of an established company, you're like a true CEO.
[P126] [SPEAKER_00]: Drucker is fantastic.
[P127] [SPEAKER_00]: Andy Grove, which we've talked about, has a book called High Output Management, probably the best management book ever written.
[P128] [SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor for John Doerr, who then wrote a book called Measure What Matters, which is really what got you and I started on what has now turned into the game plan.
[P129] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly don't want to put myself in the family tree of Andy Grove to door to Matt Reynolds.
[P130] [SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is that those books shaped very much the way I run the business.
[P131] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these books are excellent.
[P132] [SPEAKER_00]: I think the best place to start is still the E-Myth.
[P133] [SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've talked a lot about Dan Martell's Buy Back Your Time and the concept there.
[P134] [SPEAKER_00]: There's significant portions of that book that lends itself to writing systems and SOPs
[P135] [SPEAKER_00]: so that you are purchasing back your time.
[P136] [SPEAKER_00]: You're giving these other things away that you don't have to do so that you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[P137] [SPEAKER_00]: So a good synergistic book as well with Undoing Urgency.
[P138] [SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those books are excellent.
[P139] [SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there, but those are some of our favorites.
[P140] [SPEAKER_01]: An aspect of this that is personal management of your tasks and organizing that as a founder is
[P141] [SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's unclear where your stuff starts and ends and the business's stuff starts and ends, right?
[P142] [SPEAKER_01]: So some of these books are better crafted towards the individual who is in the early phases of their founding process in an early company.
[P143] [SPEAKER_01]: And then some are, you know, Andy Grove with Intel, pretty big, right?
[P144] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of scales up.
[P145] [SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no matter where you are in that journey, everybody struggles with the same thing.
[P146] [SPEAKER_01]: Same list of things.
[P147] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a little bit of interesting info on this.
[P148] [SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes this happens, you know, certainly with authors, but it happens with podcasts as well.
[P149] [SPEAKER_01]: Where you can be listening to this and think, oh, Matt and I have got this figured out.
[P150] [SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, like, we got this nailed.
[P151] [SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[P152] [SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to that is, actually, most of the time, we're talking to ourselves.
[P153] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P154] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P155] [SPEAKER_01]: So, just to give you an idea, I missed two meetings yesterday because I had quickly...
[P156] [SPEAKER_01]: My situation is strange in that I have to, I do deep work a lot, but in my deep work, I'm inventing solutions for companies.
[P157] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[P158] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's never been done before.
[P159] [SPEAKER_01]: I've not done it.
[P160] [SPEAKER_01]: No one else has done it either.
[P161] [SPEAKER_01]: And I'm inventing some new solution.
[P162] [SPEAKER_01]: And that solution is deeply technical and all those things.
[P163] [SPEAKER_01]: I had not yet taken the time to hand off more of the tasks that I needed to hand off to build the playbook, to make the introduction to the people and do all the things that need to be done.
[P164] [SPEAKER_01]: And so at every phase of growth, you will run into this problem again.
[P165] [SPEAKER_01]: You will see it again.
[P166] [SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a point in time where you go, oh, I tackled that.
[P167] [SPEAKER_01]: That's solved.
[P168] [SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.
[P169] [SPEAKER_01]: It's solved for this phase right now.
[P170] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've done this many, many, many times.
[P171] [SPEAKER_01]: And at varying degrees of scale, you run into the problem again.
[P172] [SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it's like an old friend.
[P173] [SPEAKER_01]: You look at it and you're like, oh, thank God.
[P174] [SPEAKER_01]: This is...
[P175] [SPEAKER_01]: This is where the solution is.
[P176] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just need to, I need to hand a few things off, make some introductions.
[P177] [SPEAKER_01]: I need to write some playbooks and I need to, and I need to go through this, this process.
[P178] [SPEAKER_01]: So just understand, give yourself a lot of grace on this because everybody runs into the same set of problems over and over and over again.
[P179] [SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, it will continue to happen.
[P180] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to remember, oh, you know, I'm starting to feel the stress.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: The urgency is getting super high.
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to miss meetings like, oh, crap, I need to go in and do some work here to to hand some things off.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So just a note that like, yeah, everybody deals with this.
[P185] [SPEAKER_00]: We will often talk about the carryover between like training as with me as a strength training coach in my background.
[P186] [SPEAKER_00]: You've done lots of training.
[P187] [SPEAKER_00]: I've coached you.
[P188] [SPEAKER_00]: We've trained together.
[P189] [SPEAKER_00]: Training in the beginning is extremely simple.
[P190] [SPEAKER_00]: It's linear progression.
[P191] [SPEAKER_00]: It's adding five pounds to the bar.
[P192] [SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly simple.
[P193] [SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it has to become more complex.
[P194] [SPEAKER_00]: The key is to not let it become more complex than it has to be.
[P195] [SPEAKER_00]: It's still the simplest it can be for the period of time that you're in as the business grows, as you might imagine.
[P196] [SPEAKER_00]: I can't even fathom the complexity at, say, Amazon, where they're running these two massive companies, if not even more, in the retail side, in the AWS side, or Google, Alphabet.
[P197] [SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the things that Elon Musk is doing.
[P198] [SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how he does those things.
[P199] [SPEAKER_00]: But for us, as our businesses have grown, in the beginning, it really is relatively simple.
[P200] [SPEAKER_00]: You're doing everything.
[P201] [SPEAKER_00]: You start to identify the things that are easy systems to write,
[P202] [SPEAKER_00]: That can be hired out for relatively low wage and you give those away.
[P203] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place to learn with very low risk on how to write these systems to hand them off to somebody to a college kid, to a high school kid, to somebody who has, you know, entry level wage job.
[P204] [SPEAKER_00]: This gets much more difficult as you're writing systems and standard operating procedures for executives.
[P205] [SPEAKER_00]: which again, as a CEO, you're often, they're direct reporting to you and then they're writing lots of systems and standard operating procedures to their management team and so on and so forth.
[P206] [SPEAKER_00]: So when I started this process at Strong Gym first and then what is now Barbell Logic,
[P207] [SPEAKER_00]: I just made a list of all the things in my business that I was doing, all the tasks.
[P208] [SPEAKER_00]: And we've even talked about this in kind of setting up, identifying this list of important, urgent sort of dichotomy of things.
[P209] [SPEAKER_00]: And so I had my list because there weren't any other employees in the beginning.
[P210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then as those things started to fill up and I just couldn't stay ahead, I started to write systems and SOPs that were the simplest things I could write in five minutes or 10 minutes.
[P211] [SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and did the work.
[P212] [SPEAKER_00]: I hired somebody to do the thing.
[P213] [SPEAKER_00]: I trained them up on the thing, which shouldn't take very long because it's a simple task.
[P214] [SPEAKER_00]: and then you give them the system or the SOP, right?
[P215] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key then is to start writing those simplest systems first, and often even the ones that you are still doing, you then get to test that.
[P216] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really just the scientific method.
[P217] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[P218] [SPEAKER_00]: Are things in the right order?
[P219] [SPEAKER_00]: As you get it pretty tight, and it's not gonna be 100%, then you'll start to give that thing away.
[P220] [SPEAKER_00]: And so the key here is that you have to start.
[P221] [SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned about giving yourself grace, and I absolutely agree, because even today at Barbell Logic, as we continue to grow,
[P222] [SPEAKER_00]: just coming back from Washington and meeting with my executive team, we recognize that for 2025, there are three, four, five, 10 systems that are new endeavors for the company in 2025 that we don't have systems and stops written for yet.
[P223] [SPEAKER_00]: We have all these other, I mean, we have thousands of those.
[P224] [SPEAKER_00]: But we have five or 10 that need to be written now.
[P225] [SPEAKER_00]: And so now the goal of the executive team is to come back and figure out who needs to write that system or stop.
[P226] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the executive team?
[P227] [SPEAKER_00]: Is it somebody on the management team?
[P228] [SPEAKER_00]: And start to pass those things down.
[P229] [SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we do then at Barbell Logic as the business becomes a little bigger and becomes a little more complex is then not only do I look at my task list,
[P230] [SPEAKER_00]: I start to look at the life of the client, every single touch point, every single milestone of the client, from the time the client first hears about you on a podcast or sees a YouTube video or whatever that thing is, when they first have engagement or awareness that you exist, to the time they become a lead, to how you nurture them as leads,
[P231] [SPEAKER_00]: to how you convert them.
[P232] [SPEAKER_00]: And all of the things that go in that, that's not just a one-step process.
[P233] [SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of, there's some people that are just like, you know, great, money wired, done, right?
[P234] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's others that want to do nine phone calls to be converted and then you convert them.
[P235] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to go in the process of the post-conversion client lifecycle.
[P236] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how long does it take for them to get buy-in, to fully activate
[P237] [SPEAKER_00]: to really accept the thing that you're providing them, the service or the product that you're selling them.
[P238] [SPEAKER_00]: And from there, then it's like, okay, then what are all the things that could potentially go wrong?
[P239] [SPEAKER_00]: What are all the possible roadblocks or challenges that they're gonna have?
[P240] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we've mapped out our client lifecycle.
[P241] [SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that includes both in the B2C sector and the Barbellogic Online Coaching sector, where we're dealing directly with, our coaches deal directly with clients.
[P242] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy leaning on the marketing team,
[P243] [SPEAKER_00]: advertising, sales team, customer service, coaches, all the way down to the client.
[P244] [SPEAKER_00]: But then as you get to the B2B sector, it gets even more complicated because now you're selling not just to an individual client, you're selling to a business who is then leveraging your service or product to their clients.
[P245] [SPEAKER_00]: And you have to start to think about that entire client lifecycle.
[P246] [SPEAKER_00]: And so
[P247] [SPEAKER_00]: Where this has really come to fruition, even for me personally this year, is that 2024 was a very busy year, obviously writing the book.
[P248] [SPEAKER_00]: The book has done very well.
[P249] [SPEAKER_00]: This podcast continues to blow up.
[P250] [SPEAKER_00]: We had 475,000 downloads last week, which is insane.
[P251] [SPEAKER_00]: That's nuts.
[P252] [SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for listening, and please continue to share and give us reviews.
[P253] [SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to have this podcast, but...
[P254] [SPEAKER_00]: We are at a spot now where the growth in the company, we believe, is primarily going to be leveraged or we're going to move the needle the most in being able to grow the B2B commercial sector.
[P255] [SPEAKER_00]: So Turnkey Coach, which is our B2B product,
[P256] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a great sales guy.
[P257] [SPEAKER_00]: And some CEOs are sales CEOs, and some CEOs are tech CEOs or engineering CEOs.
[P258] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sales CEO, which means for the next six months, these things that have taken me out of the sales cycle, it's time for Matt, the CEO, to get back into the sales cycle.
[P259] [SPEAKER_00]: Not because I want to be the head sales guy for the rest of the life of the company.
[P260] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[P261] [SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to revisit the systems and SOPs, train up the team, create those things, learn from the ones that are already doing excellent versions of sales, both in the B2C and B2B sector, and write those systems and SOPs and devote my time there.
[P262] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, not to skip ahead too much, but this is where it comes down to the game plan where you start to identify what are the most important goals that you need to achieve in the business each year, which then also requires you to pull weeds on the things that you're doing that you shouldn't be doing.
[P263] [SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do in understanding, okay, here's how my role is going to change a little bit in 2025, is I have to look at the things that I'm doing that no one else is doing or no one else can do because the system or SOP hasn't been written, write it, and give it away.
[P264] [SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[P265] [SPEAKER_01]: A couple things spin out of that, I feel like.
[P266] [SPEAKER_01]: One of them is...
[P267] [SPEAKER_01]: You rightfully said, I got to go take the seat back in sales for a bit so that I can sort of go through what that process looks like, use my judgment to figure out
[P268] [SPEAKER_01]: how we want to build the processes going forward and what kinds of decisions we need to make and what kind of systems we need before I can hand them off.
[P269] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's the thing that makes this difficult.
[P270] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's where a lot of people get stuck.
[P271] [SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you've got, as a founder,
[P272] [SPEAKER_01]: At least initially, initially, there's one person on the planet whose judgment you trust.
[P273] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P274] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's yours.
[P275] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P276] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P277] [SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, that changes.
[P278] [SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you will come to trust in other people's judgment.
[P279] [SPEAKER_01]: And those will be the sort of your long-term employees, long-term executives that you'll put in place.
[P280] [SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that you're going to have to do to give yourself enough time to even do that is
[P281] [SPEAKER_01]: is you got to start by pulling the weeds.
[P282] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P283] [SPEAKER_01]: There are weeds that can be pulled in this case that are literally where the whole SOP is an email that needs to go to somebody and you're basically done.
[P284] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I did that one yesterday where it was like, why am I interviewing all these people?
[P285] [SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you trust the person.
[P286] [SPEAKER_00]: If you trust the person that you're emailing, you actually then trust them to write the SOP.
[P287] [SPEAKER_00]: You tell them to.
[P288] [SPEAKER_00]: You say, like, this is going to be your job now.
[P289] [SPEAKER_00]: Write this up.
[P290] [SPEAKER_00]: Send it to me.
[P291] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll put my stamp of approval on it.
[P292] [SPEAKER_00]: But I trust you.
[P293] [SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be great.
[P294] [SPEAKER_00]: And you pass it off.
[P295] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P296] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got these things where you are inventing the future.
[P297] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are using your judgment to figure out what a sales go forward motion looks like.
[P298] [SPEAKER_01]: You are figuring out how to do various things.
[P299] [SPEAKER_01]: And on those things, you are right to keep them initially.
[P300] [SPEAKER_01]: That is the list of things you need to be working on, right?
[P301] [SPEAKER_01]: But it ends up being what are all the other things that are not those things that you need to hand off and make sure that you have clear definitions around.
[P302] [SPEAKER_01]: For us, I think our business essentially creates these for people.
[P303] [SPEAKER_01]: What we do with a lot of engineering companies or the engineering portion of an organization is we'll go in and actually watch what they're doing and the way they're building software and shipping it and all the various things that are happening.
[P304] [SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out very quickly where they are losing time and why maybe it's not as effective as it needs to be.
[P305] [SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually take those resources.
[P306] [SPEAKER_01]: standard operating procedures.
[P307] [SPEAKER_01]: We write them down, make sure that everybody agrees on them or at least understands them.
[P308] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't always get agreement early on.
[P309] [SPEAKER_01]: We have to sometimes just get, you know, sorry, but this is what we need to do.
[P310] [SPEAKER_01]: We automate those, right?
[P311] [SPEAKER_01]: So they were completely automated.
[P312] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting is being that company
[P313] [SPEAKER_01]: you kind of have the problem where the cobbler's children have no shoes, that whole thing.
[P314] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we're doing this for other people, hard for us to remember to do it for ourselves.
[P315] [SPEAKER_01]: And you may find that you do something very similar, especially if you're in a service business, a lot of what you do, helping other organizations, helping people, whatever, you can find that you're needing to turn that attention towards yourself a little bit to say like, how do we build some of these processes and procedures?
[P316] [SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the thing that you need to make sure that you keep clear in your mind is there are tasks that are judgment-oriented tasks, and they are going to be the prime tasks that you are going to need to work on.
[P317] [SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get them into a formalized system and hand them off, right?
[P318] [SPEAKER_01]: But you may have to do it for a while.
[P319] [SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[P320] [SPEAKER_00]: That process is pulling the weeds on the things you don't have to be doing right now so that you can focus on the things that you should be doing right now.
[P321] [SPEAKER_00]: As you're focusing on the things that you should be doing right now, you're then writing the system for that thing so that eventually you don't have to do that thing either.
[P322] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P323] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe Dan Martell might disagree with me.
[P324] [SPEAKER_00]: For us, I love my work.
[P325] [SPEAKER_00]: You love your work.
[P326] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not so I can unload everything off of my list forever so I can just retire and have a cash cow and just be the owner of the business and get paid.
[P327] [SPEAKER_00]: I like solving problems in the business, just like you like solving problems in both your business and other businesses.
[P328] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that, it's that there's always the next important thing that the founder or CEO needs to do.
[P329] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why things like the game plan, a seasonal game plan or a yearly game plan
[P330] [SPEAKER_00]: constantly focuses you on the goals that really matter.
[P331] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't have 20 goals.
[P332] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why.
[P333] [SPEAKER_00]: So for again, for example, out of our work in Washington, one of the things that we noted that we thought may would make the biggest difference for the companies, we have three primary priorities or goals for this year in the company.
[P334] [SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because you help work on on turnkey coach, your dev team does.
[P335] [SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to convert coaches to turnkey coach.
[P336] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them fully bought in or what we call activated.
[P337] [SPEAKER_00]: So as we define activation, to get 90% plus of their clients onto the software or to have at least five or 10 clients on their roster, whatever that is.
[P338] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece, it's that buy-in piece.
[P339] [SPEAKER_00]: It's what happens right after conversion.
[P340] [SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean, very clear onboarding.
[P341] [SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we move somebody from conversion to full activation?
[P342] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually not owning that.
[P343] [SPEAKER_00]: Andrew owns that.
[P344] [SPEAKER_00]: He's our COO.
[P345] [SPEAKER_00]: He helps organize the entire product team.
[P346] [SPEAKER_00]: He works with you at Certain and the
[P347] [SPEAKER_00]: your dev team and our dev team.
[P348] [SPEAKER_00]: But for him, in the same way that I have to go back and do some sales and understand the sales process again because of how the world has changed the last several years, as a tech person, I think a lot of times you just have to go back and talk to the customers.
[P349] [SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, there's going to be a lot of talking to customers to understand where are their pain points that are keeping them, that we're able to get them converted, but not to step in and fully bought in to the system.
[P350] [SPEAKER_00]: So that activation piece is his SOP, is his responsibility to write and then to pass down.
[P351] [SPEAKER_00]: After that, and this is not in chronological order, for us, number two is acquisition.
[P352] [SPEAKER_00]: And for acquisition, my CMO owns that.
[P353] [SPEAKER_00]: That acquisition piece is everything from top of the funnel to conversion.
[P354] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna own the conversion piece.
[P355] [SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation where even though I'm the CEO and the founder,
[P356] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually direct reporting up to the CMO in the acquisition piece.
[P357] [SPEAKER_00]: He's in charge of helping make sure we have systems for every place.
[P358] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, top of funnel, lead, lead nurturing, conversion, all of that.
[P359] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'll write the systems from lead nurture to conversion.
[P360] [SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a smooth handoff to the activation team from conversion.
[P361] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that activation team is product, customer service, working together a lot, lots of talking to the clients.
[P362] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it becomes more of an expansion or retention.
[P363] [SPEAKER_00]: How then do we increase the lifetime value of the customer from that perspective or from that point on?
[P364] [SPEAKER_00]: And Nikki Sims, my CXO, she'll own that and she'll own that SOP.
[P365] [SPEAKER_00]: And so full circle,
[P366] [SPEAKER_00]: When I started Barbell Logic, I've told this story where I just sat at my desk for like 16 hours a day and wrote systems.
[P367] [SPEAKER_00]: Everything I could possibly think of, right?
[P368] [SPEAKER_00]: Like how does somebody put their credit card on file?
[P369] [SPEAKER_00]: What happens if their credit card bounces?
[P370] [SPEAKER_00]: What's the email they get for the welcome to Barbell Logic?
[P371] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them connected to a coach?
[P372] [SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them to do their first test workout?
[P373] [SPEAKER_00]: Does the coach know all the technology to break down the technique?
[P374] [SPEAKER_00]: All of those sorts of things were very important and very clear to me that that was what needed to be done because I had been coaching.
[P375] [SPEAKER_00]: We also have an advantage that you've talked about in the past that I think sometimes we forget as a moat for Barbell Logic and Turnkey Coaches that we built Turnkey Coach for strength coaches and we are strength coaches.
[P376] [SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've built this software and this system to serve Barbell Logic Online Coaching first, really having no, we hadn't even looked forward into the future of being a B2B company yet.
[P377] [SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building something that we enjoy and that we like because, and most of our coaches are not just coaches on the platform, but they're clients on the platform.
[P378] [SPEAKER_00]: So we see it from the client side, we see it from the coach side.
[P379] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go to other businesses, other coaching companies who maybe aren't quite like us,
[P380] [SPEAKER_00]: But we're already really close on solving those problems.
[P381] [SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking about when you were running an insurance software company, you've never run an insurance company.
[P382] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you're trying to solve problems for an insurance company, having never run an insurance company, which is what 99% of all tech companies do.
[P383] [SPEAKER_00]: We've got the opportunity to be able to build a thing.
[P384] [SPEAKER_00]: And then we now look at Barbellogic Online Coaching as really the alpha tester of the features that we produce.
[P385] [SPEAKER_01]: of the things that we launch we often test those ahead of time let's see what the feedback is before we push them out to the rest of the b2b world it's the best opportunity you can have like wherever you can do this as a business you should always do it the idea in software is called usually it's called eating your own dog food which i don't really know why they call it that exactly but the idea is the stuff you make
[P386] [SPEAKER_01]: is maybe not totally fully baked yet.
[P387] [SPEAKER_01]: And you want to be the first consumer of that so that you know what the experience is like.
[P388] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P389] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you can be the customer and also the company that is delivering the goods or services to that customer, you're in the best possible feedback loop you can be in.
[P390] [SPEAKER_00]: And not a fake version, not like I'm going to pretend to be an insurance company or I'm going to pretend to be a strength coach.
[P391] [SPEAKER_00]: We actually are strength coaches.
[P392] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually said when I was basically building an insurance software company, further along in that process, it would have been valuable to have acquired a small insurance company that wasn't competitive with our customers so that we could run it and use the software simultaneously.
[P393] [SPEAKER_01]: That...
[P394] [SPEAKER_01]: Feedback loop was one I always wanted.
[P395] [SPEAKER_01]: And the closest proxy that you can get to this, and I actually think this is also really good input for those of you that can't do this.
[P396] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a good proxy for this is just how freaking close you need to be to your customers.
[P397] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P398] [SPEAKER_01]: Just do things like, it'll blow their minds if you ever go to a customer and say, let's say you get feedback on something and the customer says, this part's not working so well.
[P399] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty painful for us and we're dealing with it on a day in and day out basis.
[P400] [SPEAKER_01]: A thing you can do to solve that problem is say, okay, give it to us.
[P401] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this manually as you.
[P402] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to step in as you.
[P403] [SPEAKER_01]: We're going to handle it because we won't deal with it for very long before we automate it or solve this problem for good with this thing that we're doing.
[P404] [SPEAKER_01]: And so you can step into their shoes and it looks like incredible customer service to them.
[P405] [SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be blown away because nobody does this, by the way.
[P406] [SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[P407] [SPEAKER_01]: And if you will do it, you set yourself apart as being a top 0.01% company.
[P408] [SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage is really that you are standing in the shoes of your customer so that you can understand what needs to be done.
[P409] [SPEAKER_01]: And taking this back to this idea of SOPs and the way that we build our systems, this is another example of a place where we're talking about the critical nature of judgment.
[P410] [SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have, if it's you, if it's an exec, whoever it is that is actually doing this,
[P411] [SPEAKER_01]: It takes tons of judgment and a lot of buy-in and ownership mentality to be able to do this well.
[P412] [SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine trying to hand off to a low-level employee the idea of, you know, I want you to stand in the shoes of the customer now and let's solve this problem for good for them.
[P413] [SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to see is you just gave me an extra task that I have to do and it doesn't sound like my job.
[P414] [SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like their job, right?
[P415] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P416] [SPEAKER_01]: And that won't work at all.
[P417] [SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not why you're doing it.
[P418] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing it so that you have a thing to do.
[P419] [SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it so that you solve something for the customer.
[P420] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a completely different mindset.
[P421] [SPEAKER_01]: So as you build these out, there's a very, very important sort of Occam's razor here about how you decide what things are being handed off and what things you need to either keep or give to an executive as a primary SOP that they're going to be working on.
[P422] [SPEAKER_01]: And that is really built around how much judgment does it take?
[P423] [SPEAKER_01]: And is the person properly incentivized to make sure that this goes, you know, the way it needs to go?
[P424] [SPEAKER_00]: You always have the vocal minority, right?
[P425] [SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have clients, B2B clients, who are very small, who just have a few clients on the roster.
[P426] [SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, boy, if you could give me this feature, I think I would be all in.
[P427] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's the only time you've ever heard that.
[P428] [SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Andrew and the team have done, the operations team has done really, really well is they're always listening.
[P429] [SPEAKER_00]: And as that pops up a few more times, you start to realize like, okay, if I solve this problem, I'm not just solving it for this customer.
[P430] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm solving it for many or maybe even all the customers in the future.
[P431] [SPEAKER_00]: And so then your order of operations, and we do the same, is let's just figure out the manual way to fix this first, which makes it slower in the beginning.
[P432] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that it works when it works, and then you can fully automate.
[P433] [SPEAKER_00]: the cost of full-blown software development, automation, launching, and then having the thing still not work, that's actually a far greater waste of time.
[P434] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be patient in the beginning to say, we're going to test this.
[P435] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to manually do this.
[P436] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure this works.
[P437] [SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the feedback.
[P438] [SPEAKER_00]: And when we know that it works, now we take all of our efforts and we go, now, how do we take this off of the manual plate and put it on the automated plate?
[P439] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really key.
[P440] [SPEAKER_01]: What a good, that's a super good point too.
[P441] [SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't think that this is,
[P442] [SPEAKER_01]: perfectly obvious to most people because I have to say it on an almost daily basis, not just to my own staff, but also to the companies that we work with that you never, ever, ever
[P443] [SPEAKER_01]: automate something before you get the manual process right right so like this is like to me this is this is just like business 101 like but it's really really important to get this deep in your brain that there are a lot of things that you can automate and a lot of processes that you can build and and
[P444] [SPEAKER_01]: None of those things should happen until you are absolutely confident that you've got the right procedure or process in place to begin with, right?
[P445] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're doing the right things.
[P446] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't automate the wrong things.
[P447] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible thing to do.
[P448] [SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to tear down the automation and rebuild and all these things.
[P449] [SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important that you always, always, always do the work manually manually.
[P450] [SPEAKER_01]: To start, make sure you validated that it's good.
[P451] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the customer experience is good.
[P452] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the whole process is the way you want it to be before you get it locked down and start automating it.
[P453] [SPEAKER_01]: Because even the automated processes, once you build them, still have to be maintained.
[P454] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P455] [SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to change a little over time, right?
[P456] [SPEAKER_01]: Things change on the ground, you know, new technology emerges and all that.
[P457] [SPEAKER_01]: So these things will have to be revisited over time, but never, ever, ever automate a thing until you have it manually working exactly the way you want.
[P458] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the last piece on that is just to understand what you said there at the end is very important, is that all SOPs are living SOPs.
[P459] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[P460] [SPEAKER_00]: These are not documents that go into a three-ring binder, not that anybody uses those anymore, and then just sits.
[P461] [SPEAKER_00]: As technology changes and the customer changes and the needs of the customer change, the SOP will change a little bit.
[P462] [SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't typically change 90% or 80%.
[P463] [SPEAKER_00]: It changes 2% at a time, 5% at a time.
[P464] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of steering the ship.
[P465] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you already have a great system or SOP in place, making a 5% change is much easier than making a 90% change to that SOP.
[P466] [SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to recognize that these things are always living.
[P467] [SPEAKER_00]: That SOPs that I wrote 10 years ago for onboarding a client, our onboarding system looks totally different now, but it didn't go from what it was to what it is
[P468] [SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it took 10 years of little iterations to continue to get it better and better over time.
[P469] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that doesn't feel like such a huge spend of resources, whether that's time, effort, or money.
[P470] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we approach this.
[P471] [SPEAKER_00]: These things are always living as new owners own those stops, they bring their skill set.
[P472] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another piece of this is that as the business grows,
[P473] [SPEAKER_00]: While, yes, you may be the best at all of these things on day one or in the first year, you are then hiring people and giving sops away to the right people who have the potential to be much better at them than you are.
[P474] [SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you do recognize, and I think most people go through this as you get into your middle ages, that you, in fact, are not superhuman and you're not great at everything.
[P475] [SPEAKER_00]: And so you do the thing that you're great at and you give away the things that you're not great at to people who are great at those things.
[P476] [SPEAKER_00]: And just like you said, there's somebody out there that loves that thing that you may hate, but someone else loves it.
[P477] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person to own that SOP.
[P478] [SPEAKER_00]: And on day one, and Martel talks about this, if you can hire somebody, you know, at best, they're going to be 80% of what you are.
[P479] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're going to be 25%.
[P480] [SPEAKER_00]: of what you are at this.
[P481] [SPEAKER_00]: But if they have the potential to be 80% or above, that's the place to push out.
[P482] [SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find, what I've found, is that especially at the executive level, all of the executives are far better at their job than I would ever have the potential to be, even if I spent the next 10 years of my life doing just their job.
[P483] [SPEAKER_00]: I would not be better at their job than they are at their job because they're different personalities.
[P484] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from different backgrounds.
[P485] [SPEAKER_00]: They have different skill sets.
[P486] [SPEAKER_00]: This is what matters.
[P487] [SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so important to pick the right person to hand that SOP off to.
[P488] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P489] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually we'll have a conversation around how you build executive teams.
[P490] [SPEAKER_01]: But this is the way, right?
[P491] [SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, a good executive team, first of all, they don't all look like each other, talk like each other, do the same thing, right?
[P492] [SPEAKER_01]: That you're looking for people that fill the gaps of the things that you as a founder, that's how you're going to start.
[P493] [SPEAKER_01]: You as a founder are bad at, right?
[P494] [SPEAKER_01]: You want to find people that sort of fill in those gaps.
[P495] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P496] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is definitely also true that you are going to find that there are areas of the company that are really critical that you are just either not good at or cannot make yourself stay interested in.
[P497] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a few of those myself.
[P498] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by most things.
[P499] [SPEAKER_01]: There are some things I'm not fascinated by.
[P500] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just need somebody else to do that work.
[P501] [SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who absolutely love it, so hand it to them.
[P502] [SPEAKER_01]: The last piece of this is also, and this is a callback to a thing you said earlier, and I think it's really also very important.
[P503] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen companies as they've grown, and I'm talking about grown to the level of being ready to publicly IPO.
[P504] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[P505] [SPEAKER_01]: Big companies.
[P506] [SPEAKER_01]: Big, right?
[P507] [SPEAKER_01]: I have seen the CEOs of those companies still grow.
[P508] [SPEAKER_01]: have to go take a position within the company, take off CEO hat for a second, right?
[P509] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always keep your CEO hat on, you know, technically, but...
[P510] [SPEAKER_01]: They take it off and go step into like a key sale or some of the key roles that need to be done.
[P511] [SPEAKER_01]: Because at the technician level, and it may not be sales, right?
[P512] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the tech company, in the technician roles, that human is still probably a top 0.0001% in that one technical space.
[P513] [SPEAKER_01]: And every so often...
[P514] [SPEAKER_01]: They need to go step into that role for a second to help the company get something across the finish line.
[P515] [SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[P516] [SPEAKER_01]: It should not drive you crazy if that has to happen.
[P517] [SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[P518] [SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a failure if that happens.
[P519] [SPEAKER_01]: That is simply my way of saying, yes, you're going to hand things off.
[P520] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're going to create standard operating procedures.
[P521] [SPEAKER_01]: There are still going to be times where you need to recognize, and it's okay to recognize, that you have the magic in some capacity within the organization that you may need to step into and hold that role for a couple weeks, a couple months, until you are able to train the team up to be at that 80% line of what you are.
[P522] [SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always about, I'm looking for that 80% line.
[P523] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect 100.
[P524] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do, you're going to fail at this.
[P525] [SPEAKER_01]: I think 80% is the number.
[P526] [SPEAKER_01]: The human you're going to put in charge of a thing needs to have the capacity to get to 80% of what you can do
[P527] [SPEAKER_01]: it may never get higher than that.
[P528] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[P529] [SPEAKER_01]: Or at least your perception of it may not get above that.
[P530] [SPEAKER_00]: But often they do grow into over time and are better at it.
[P531] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about specific really quick on how you actually create SOPs because I think technology has changed us quite a bit.
[P532] [SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[P533] [SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing SOPs in the early days, I was writing SOPs, like a Google Doc.
[P534] [SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, Google Docs were probably relatively new.
[P535] [SPEAKER_00]: I might have been writing them on Microsoft Word.
[P536] [SPEAKER_00]: And you use video a lot now.
[P537] [SPEAKER_00]: You use Loom and whatnot.
[P538] [SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time for you, as you think about, again, the time investment that it takes to write a SOP, what you found is that by recording a video and just walking through you doing the system or the SOP,
[P539] [SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start to create that.
[P540] [SPEAKER_00]: What's that process look like for you?
[P541] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P542] [SPEAKER_01]: So just remember the type of work matters here.
[P543] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out on a manufacturing floor, this is not going to work.
[P544] [SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somebody to either walk around with you with a camera or whatever.
[P545] [SPEAKER_01]: But for me, everything that I do is on a computer.
[P546] [SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do is on screens.
[P547] [SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we solve are those things, right?
[P548] [SPEAKER_01]: So what I've learned is that
[P549] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay for me to take even a pretty critical event, something that's like, this thing needs to get done in the next 30 minutes or this customer is gonna be pretty upset about it.
[P550] [SPEAKER_01]: Even in that kind of intensity, which is where we live day in and day out, I will still fire up a Loom video and record my screen and talk through it as I go.
[P551] [SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't slow me down more than one or 2% because I'm doing this anyway.
[P552] [SPEAKER_01]: In my head, I'm thinking all the steps.
[P553] [SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the words come out of my mouth while I'm showing it on the screen, just like if I was on a Zoom call or if I had a person behind me or something and they were looking at it, right?
[P554] [SPEAKER_01]: And I walk them through step-by-step what's going on.
[P555] [SPEAKER_01]: And I do that because that is so easy for me to hand off.
[P556] [SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the thing anyway because nobody else knows how to do it yet.
[P557] [SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do the thing.
[P558] [SPEAKER_01]: Might as well record the video.
[P559] [SPEAKER_01]: Once I've recorded the video, I now have most of what I need to hand it off.
[P560] [SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll take the video and
[P561] [SPEAKER_01]: I hand that to the most ideal person to own that standard operating procedure.
[P562] [SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, this is a process that is mostly baked.
[P563] [SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfectly baked.
[P564] [SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions, ask me.
[P565] [SPEAKER_01]: There's like this little period of time where I want to make sure that we get this really well refined.
[P566] [SPEAKER_01]: But I go ahead and hand it off.
[P567] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell them, I want you to make the generic process
[P568] [SPEAKER_01]: SOP, which means I don't want a written form of my video.
[P569] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be helpful.
[P570] [SPEAKER_01]: They can just watch the video.
[P571] [SPEAKER_01]: What I want instead is just very generic lines for this.
[P572] [SPEAKER_01]: Today, you can get Loom, for example, which is a tool I typically use.
[P573] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you the transcript.
[P574] [SPEAKER_01]: You can take the transcript, drop it in AI, and say, I want a generic set of steps for this thing.
[P575] [SPEAKER_01]: The thing is done, right?
[P576] [SPEAKER_00]: Or 90% done, right?
[P577] [SPEAKER_00]: So you're watching the video.
[P578] [SPEAKER_00]: you get it transcribed, you plug it into AI, you say, give me a clear step-by-step SOP for this.
[P579] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you just pour over it and you basically copy edit that and make sure that it doesn't miss any steps, make sure that everything's clear.
[P580] [SPEAKER_00]: It works incredibly well.
[P581] [SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a great way to do a SOP for sure.
[P582] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then I think the final step of this is make sure they understand that they now own it
[P583] [SPEAKER_01]: And that they can and should change it.
[P584] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P585] [SPEAKER_01]: But now here is really the kicker because people suck at this.
[P586] [SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody hears it.
[P587] [SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.
[P588] [SPEAKER_01]: Only if you write those changes down and they make it into the formal documentation.
[P589] [SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[P590] [SPEAKER_01]: What happens to unravel a company.
[P591] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[P592] [SPEAKER_01]: Is that people will take these standard operating procedures and things get busy.
[P593] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, you know, I had a critical customer ticket I had to deal with.
[P594] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[P595] [SPEAKER_01]: And it changes over time with no documentation and no clarity.
[P596] [SPEAKER_00]: Now they're the only person that can do it.
[P597] [SPEAKER_00]: Now you got a problem.
[P598] [SPEAKER_00]: And then that person dies in a car accident or leaves the company or whatever.
[P599] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, oh, God, nobody knows how to do this anymore.
[P600] [SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[P601] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say this like it's a, you know, I don't see this super frequently.
[P602] [SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just be held hostage by people that are like, I have found people as a rare person.
[P603] [SPEAKER_01]: If you ever find them, you have to fire them immediately.
[P604] [SPEAKER_01]: You have to immediately fire them.
[P605] [SPEAKER_01]: I have found people that will hoard information merely for the purpose of making sure they're the only one that knows how to do the thing.
[P606] [SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, a company, that's cancer in a company.
[P607] [SPEAKER_01]: You can't have that.
[P608] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that linchpin model.
[P609] [SPEAKER_00]: The book is fine, but if you've ever read that book, there's a little bit of that.
[P610] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're wired just to be evil enough,
[P611] [SPEAKER_00]: That you make yourself the linchpin and then you hold that hostage over the company.
[P612] [SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[P613] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real bad.
[P614] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not part of the core values of who we are.
[P615] [SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[P616] [SPEAKER_01]: Last step in there is just you got to follow up.
[P617] [SPEAKER_01]: So this is where your one-on-ones will happen with the people that you hand these things to.
[P618] [SPEAKER_01]: You should be having those anyway.
[P619] [SPEAKER_01]: One-on-ones are very valuable.
[P620] [SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a conversation about that at some point.
[P621] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think those one-on-one meetings...
[P622] [SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary purposes of them is just to also go over any SOP changes that they have in place or that they have questions about.
[P623] [SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your judgment is still being applied until it has made its way to lower level employees sort of take off.
[P624] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is where I still love as simple as the technology is of like a Google Doc, because I can hand off a SOP to somebody and say, I really want you to follow this SOP 100% the first few times you do it.
[P625] [SPEAKER_00]: Now, if in the beginning you already see clearly that there are steps that need to be added or taken away, just make it a comment on the SOP.
[P626] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the one-on-one, review that with me.
[P627] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a thumbs up.
[P628] [SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes I don't even have to do it during the one-on-one.
[P629] [SPEAKER_00]: The very next day I can look at their SOP and they can put in the comment, here's why this step should be added.
[P630] [SPEAKER_00]: And I just go approve.
[P631] [SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the document.
[P632] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, but the key there again, from a culture standpoint, is that not only do you have to trust them enough to give it away,
[P633] [SPEAKER_00]: They have to know that you trust them enough for them to have ownership of it.
[P634] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P635] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees to feel like they have ownership of a thing.
[P636] [SPEAKER_00]: I want them to actually have ownership of a thing.
[P637] [SPEAKER_00]: Because when they actually have ownership of a thing, they take more pride in the thing.
[P638] [SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another story for another day.
[P639] [SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to be generous with equity, with stock options.
[P640] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want employees who feel like they're owners of the company.
[P641] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the company.
[P642] [SPEAKER_00]: I want employees who are owners of the SOPs because that raises their level of pride and expectation for themselves to go like, this is a thing I own.
[P643] [SPEAKER_00]: My boss, the investors, the board, they've entrusted me with this thing.
[P644] [SPEAKER_00]: I own it.
[P645] [SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I'm going to, if you've hired the right people, I'm going to swing for the fences and knock it out of the park.
[P646] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to prove to everybody that I can crush this because most employees, especially great ones who are internally motivated, want more responsibility, not less.
[P647] [SPEAKER_00]: They just want it clearly defined.
[P648] [SPEAKER_00]: And what a SOP does is it clearly defines the responsibility and the expectation of the SOP owner and the team that comes under that.
[P649] [SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really important.
[P650] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[P651] [SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we're going to have to wrap this one up because we have a final stop coming up here.
[P652] [SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit quite the last point.
[P653] [SPEAKER_01]: That's okay because it probably has a whole podcast coming on later.
[P654] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll lead into how these things lead into the game plan.
[P655] [SPEAKER_00]: The goals, actions, metrics, and execution, and really the execution is the SOP.
[P656] [SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the teaser for next episode or next couple episodes coming up.
[P657] [SPEAKER_00]: That's another episode of the Build Your Business podcast with Matt and Chris Reynolds.
[P658] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, things are going great.
[P659] [SPEAKER_00]: Rankings are awesome.
[P660] [SPEAKER_00]: Would love for you to share this with a friend or family member.
[P661] [SPEAKER_00]: Five-star review or honest review anywhere you listen to your podcast.
[P662] [SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody about it.
[P663] [SPEAKER_00]: Share it on social media.
[P664] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you guys next Friday.

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to the Build Your Business podcast, powered by Turnkey Coach, where we help business owners find freedom over fear.
[P2] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matt Reynolds.
[P3] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm his brother, Chris Reynolds.
[P4] [SPEAKER_00]: Join us as we help build your business and move from fear to freedom together.
[P5] [SPEAKER_00]: Happy Friday, Build Your Business listeners.
[P6] [SPEAKER_00]: This is your co-host, Matt Reynolds.
[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: We are actually going to take the week off this week because Chris and I are both business owners.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: As you know, we're like real life business owners, not just podcasters.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when you're a business owner, crap hits the fan.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: And so we had a little bit of a weird week this week.
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: Chris and I love doing this podcast.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue to do it.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: It's done incredibly well in the ratings.
[P14] [SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much for listening to the show.
[P15] [SPEAKER_00]: Chris was up all night last night.
[P16] [SPEAKER_00]: We were settled to record this this morning.
[P17] [SPEAKER_00]: He was up all night last night.
[P18] [SPEAKER_00]: with an emergency tech situation with one of his clients.
[P19] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that next week I can convince him to talk a little bit about it.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any of the details.
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: I've also been incredibly sick with a stomach virus.
[P22] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually down at a resort with my wife for our birthday.
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: We've pretty much stayed in the room while I was sick.
[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll spare you the details.
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: So between me being sick and Chris having some emergency issues where he had to work all through the night, we're going to take this week off.
[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be back next Friday for a new episode of the build your business podcast.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, hoping we can talk about, because I think it's a really great episode topic of how do we handle when crap hits the fan?
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably use a different language at that point, but sometimes it does.
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happens when you're,
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: A real business owner.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to just act like everything is always great in our businesses and they always work incredibly well.
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: And when you hit those speed bumps or those roadblocks, we'll give you some tidbits about how we handle those things.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to ask Chris some questions.
[P35] [SPEAKER_00]: What does it feel like working entirely through the night?
[P36] [SPEAKER_00]: I've done that a couple of times, but not.
[P37] [SPEAKER_00]: probably as many times as he has.
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: And so it should be a good episode.
[P39] [SPEAKER_00]: And we'll also, I know we've got an episode coming up on the game plan.
[P40] [SPEAKER_00]: We kind of led into that last week.
[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: All new episode coming out next Friday.

[P1] Nice.
[P2] I thought Marengue, isn't that Dominican?
[P3] Yeah, so my family's Cuban.
[P4] My father was actually in the Bay of Pigs.
[P5] My father was a revolutionary.
[P6] He was captured by Castro's men on the beach during the invasion.
[P7] He was on the USS Houston when it got rocketed.
[P8] Some CIA guys also were there.
[P9] Didn't make it, unfortunately.
[P10] But he was for two years in Castro's prisons.
[P11] My father was a wonderful human being, but he's also a very tormented soul.
[P12] And now, you know, we can recognize, oh, he had PTSD, right?
[P13] Or as the old timers used to say, shell shock.
[P14] So he struggled with anger and volatility for a very long time during his life.
[P15] And as a young person, I had a really weird background.
[P16] My...
[P17] There was always this idea, this understanding that after the Brigade 2506, which was what my father was part of.
[P18] In fact, if you type in my name, Luis Elizondo and Bay of Pigs, you'll see my father's prisoner number.
[P19] There was always this understanding that there would be a reinvasion by the new generation, by us, by the kids and part of Alpha 66 and try to.
[P20] So I had a really weird upbringing as a child, always with smoke-filled rooms and dim lights and weird conversations.
[P21] And so at a very early age,
[P22] I had my taste of paramilitary, and I didn't even know it.
[P23] Damn.
[P24] I thought I was part of Boy Scouts, and, you know, you go back to school and do, what did you guys do for, well, I got my, you know, how to light a fire badge.
[P25] What did you get?
[P26] Oh, we disassembled AK-47s.
[P27] You didn't do that?
[P28] Shit.
[P29] We should dig into that.
[P30] We should dig into that on the show.
[P31] Whatever you want.
[P32] Yeah, we will.
[P33] So...
[P34] Luis Elizondo, welcome to the show.
[P35] You can call me Lou if you want.
[P36] I know I look more like a Bob or a Bill or a Joe.
[P37] Thank you very much.
[P38] Sean, if I can say something just for a moment.
[P39] This is an incredible honor and privilege of mine, and not for the reasons that most people might think, not because you have a very successful show and you have a big audience.
[P40] It's because of who you are and what you have done in the service of your country.
[P41] There's a lot of people on the outside that will see things that people like you or maybe I've done and they kind of glorify that.
[P42] But we also know the other side of that.
[P43] We know the truth.
[P44] And we know the pain that it causes for the loved ones we leave behind.
[P45] It causes even to us to some degree.
[P46] You keep a piece of those experiences with you at all times.
[P47] And some of us try our best to try to suppress it.
[P48] But what you have done for our nation, I'm not sure most people in your audience can really appreciate.
[P49] And I only know because I've been there and experienced those things with you guys.
[P50] And I just want to say from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of a very grateful nation, although maybe they don't realize it, thank you for what you do.
[P51] We are only here today having this conversation in a wonderful country that we have in this incredible experiment.
[P52] because of the sacrifices you and your colleagues have made.
[P53] So before we begin, please accept my humble appreciation, sincere appreciation for the sacrifices you and your families had to make for us, for the rest of us chickens.
[P54] Thank you, man.
[P55] Man, thank you.
[P56] That means a hell of a lot.
[P57] Thank you.
[P58] But, wow, thank you for saying that.
[P59] Yeah.
[P60] And likewise.
[P61] Sincere.
[P62] Likewise.
[P63] Let's get into the interview, huh?
[P64] So everybody starts with an introduction here.
[P65] So I think we might wind up doing a little bit of a life story here.
[P66] I wasn't planning on doing that, but...
[P67] This sounds super interesting.
[P68] Lou Elizondo, Lou Elizondo, you're a former U.S.
[P69] Army counterintelligence special agent and former employee of the Office of the Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.
[P70] You led a previously covert program within the Department of Defense investigating unidentified aerial phenomenon, UAP.
[P71] Okay.
[P72] You came forward to the public about Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, AATIP, bringing to light what the government knew about these mysterious objects in our skies.
[P73] Since then, you've worked to educate both the public and policymakers about the potential implications of UAPs for national security, science, and human understanding.
[P74] You've been involved with organizations like To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science aimed at advancing research into these phenomena.
[P75] You're a fixture in the UAP transparency movement and have appeared in numerous interviews, documentaries, and media segments discussing UAPs where you've shared insight from your experience while critiquing the government's approach to transparency on this subject.
[P76] Welcome to the show.
[P77] Thank you.
[P78] One point of correction.
[P79] The UAP program at the Pentagon was not... I did run covert operations and activities, but that was for another effort while working for the U.S.
[P80] government.
[P81] The ATIP program, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which I helped lead in working with some of my colleagues, was a very sensitive program, but it wasn't covert.
[P82] I know people like to... And forgive me for saying that.
[P83] I don't know why it says that.
[P84] There's a legal definition of covert activities.
[P85] And then there is from a Department of Defense, which is Title 50.
[P86] And then from a Title 10 or DOD perspective, you have clandestine type operations and sensitive operations.
[P87] But AATIP was not covert.
[P88] It was sensitive and a lot of classified aspects to it, but it was not a Title 50 program.
[P89] Although I ran it under when I was wearing my Title 50 hat under the covert umbrella.
[P90] But in itself, it was not a covert program.
[P91] It was a highly sensitive program.
[P92] with a lot of classified aspects that I ran while I was running covert operations.
[P93] Okay.
[P94] Did you start AATIP?
[P95] I did not.
[P96] No, no, no.
[P97] It's fascinating, actually, the way AATIP started.
[P98] It actually started off as a program called ASAP, the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Special Application Program.
[P99] ASAP.
[P100] You know, in DAD, we love our acronyms, right?
[P101] Intel community.
[P102] It was in 2007.
[P103] Harry Reid...
[P104] Senator, who is, by the way, the Senate majority leader at the time.
[P105] You had Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Inouye, so Alaska and Hawaii as well.
[P106] So Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, and even former astronaut John Glenn.
[P107] All got together on the Hill and somebody like bipartisan, so Republican and Democrat.
[P108] got together and put funding together to create a program called, the contract vehicle was called ASAP.
[P109] ASAP was a big program in order to look at, from the Pentagon's perspective, the UAP or UFO in vernacular, the UFO issue.
[P110] From there, there was an aspect of ASAP.
[P111] ASAP was kind of, think of a big umbrella.
[P112] And then you have a little umbrella fitting underneath this bigger umbrella, which looked at a lot of stuff to include elements of what now is known as Skinwalker Ranch and some other things.
[P113] AATIP was really focusing on nuts and bolts of the UAP phenomenon.
[P114] So, ASAP did too, but they were much broader.
[P115] Think of a shotgun approach versus a sniper approach.
[P116] The shotgun being ASAP, the sniper being AATIP.
[P117] And so I was actually part of the ATIP program.
[P118] Although I worked with a lot of the elements in OSAP, my focus was really nuts and bolts on ATIP.
[P119] Interesting.
[P120] So it was started by Jim Lekatsky and Jay Stratton on the OSAP side.
[P121] You mentioned, so it was three state senators that started in Alaska, Nevada, and Hawaii.
[P122] Is there, I mean, interesting, a lot of UAP activity in Alaska.
[P123] Well, Ted Stevens had his own UAP encounter while he was a pilot, believe it or not.
[P124] No shit.
[P125] And let's not forget that he was in World War II.
[P126] Senator Inouye actually gave his arm for his country, all of our veterans.
[P127] Stevens was a pilot, and he had his own UAP experience.
[P128] And then, of course,
[P129] He was Alaska.
[P130] He was Alaska.
[P131] Okay.
[P132] Ted Stevens.
[P133] What was his experience?
[P134] Well, he reported, you know, classic Foo Fighter experience, these objects that would pursue him while he was a pilot, and they were performing in ways that he couldn't explain.
[P135] They were outperforming anything that he was aware of as a pilot.
[P136] instantaneous acceleration, very, very fast maneuvers, well beyond the structural limitations of what we had at the time technologically.
[P137] And so, and this, by the way, this is not isolated.
[P138] If you get a chance to talk to members of Congress privately, a lot of them will share with you their own UAP experiences.
[P139] They're like, hey, man, I was fishing with my son and all of a sudden this thing comes out of the water and saw it right there in front of us.
[P140] I think, you know, politically, they're a little shy to have that discussion publicly.
[P141] Now, maybe it'll come out, but
[P142] You'd be surprised how many people, members of Congress, have had their own experience.
[P143] Is there a lot of... I mean, the reason I brought up the three states, Nevada, obviously a lot of activity.
[P144] Alaska, a lot of activity.
[P145] Hawaii, is there a lot of activity down there?
[P146] Well, there is some.
[P147] I don't... It's hard to say there's a lot.
[P148] So there's an issue with Hawaii.
[P149] It's population density and surface area.
[P150] So...
[P151] Nevada, Alaska, lots of land mass.
[P152] When you have people all around, so you get pretty much a good persistent eye in the sky.
[P153] Maybe there's a farmer, maybe there's someone driving a truck, maybe there's a military person, military bases.
[P154] Hawaii is a much smaller land mass.
[P155] So you have
[P156] fewer people in a smaller area looking up towards the sky.
[P157] So we don't really know if Hawaii is necessarily a hotspot.
[P158] We do have a military presence there, as we know, and we do have a couple sensitive facilities there because of geographically where it's located.
[P159] And so it shouldn't be any surprise that we've had UAP activity there.
[P160] But whether or not it's as much or as consistent as some of these other areas, like we've seen with, like, now New Jersey, for example, with the drones, right, where they're being reported everywhere, you don't have that type of population
[P161] in Hawaii and you don't have the land mass.
[P162] So we really don't know.
[P163] We don't know if there's actually more activity occurring around the waters.
[P164] We don't know if there's actually an increase or a decrease simply because we don't have enough persistent, I guess I hate to use the word persistent surveillance there, but we just don't.
[P165] Remember, it's a few little islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
[P166] And so unless you're right there at the time something's happening, you're not going to know.
[P167] Mm-hmm.
[P168] You'd mentioned Skimwalker Ranch.
[P169] I'm just going, I don't want to lose anything.
[P170] No, no, no.
[P171] Have you done any work out there with Brandon?
[P172] Well, so before Brandon, there was a gentleman named Bob Bigelow, and he owned Bigelow Aerospace.
[P173] By the way, this is a gentleman who made his fortune in the hotel industry and then decided to jump to aerospace and actually succeeded, right?
[P174] So this is a guy who put together these inhabitable inflatable machines
[P175] type modules that could hook on to the ISS space station, which, by the way, they're there right now.
[P176] He actually has them connected.
[P177] And he had these projects, Genesis 1, Genesis 2 projects, to create these inflatable habitats for NASA as kind of NASA's future space program.
[P178] And he was very successful.
[P179] So he actually helped fund
[P180] through his own money, a lot of what OSAP originally did to include Skinwalker Ranch.
[P181] He owned the ranch before Brandon Fugel owned it.
[P182] And there was a very robust research effort ongoing.
[P183] People don't know that.
[P184] Oh, it's just a bunch of hooey.
[P185] No, it wasn't.
[P186] A lot of real stuff going on, a lot of real research.
[P187] And I had access to a lot of those files.
[P188] That wasn't my portfolio specific, so I don't usually talk about it.
[P189] There's other people that are far more qualified than me to talk about Skinwalker Ranch.
[P190] And by the way, there was more than one ranch.
[P191] People don't know that.
[P192] There are other facilities.
[P193] Wow.
[P194] I mean, I would imagine there would be, but...
[P195] Yeah, I've been trying to get Bigelow on here for a while.
[P196] He's an elusive guy.
[P197] And then at inauguration, I actually shared an elevator with him.
[P198] And I didn't say anything.
[P199] I didn't want to bug him.
[P200] But, you know, I just let him be.
[P201] I consider him an American hero, and I don't say that lightly.
[P202] You know, people can think what they want of individuals.
[P203] But I've seen what he's been able to contribute to our country.
[P204] And if you ask him whether he likes me or hates me, it's really irrelevant.
[P205] I've seen what he's been able to do and what he has done for our nation.
[P206] So I'm eternally grateful for what he's done.
[P207] And there's a part of that story that hasn't come out yet.
[P208] I think our country owes him a great deal of gratitude for what he's been able to do for our nation.
[P209] So you were affiliated with it before when Bigelow owned it.
[P210] I was, yeah.
[P211] What was some of the stuff that you, I mean, what was going on there?
[P212] Is it similar to what's going on with Skimwalker right now?
[P213] Very intense.
[P214] You know, again, I want to be careful not to speak for other people.
[P215] But I can tell you that there are some very strange things that occur here.
[P216] on that facility, on that ranch.
[P217] That certainly warrants additional investigation.
[P218] Are there national security implications?
[P219] Well, it depends what your definition of national security is, but there's certainly enough going on there that warrants further inquiry.
[P220] So I applaud what they're doing, what Brandon Fugel and others are doing.
[P221] I think it's important.
[P222] Why do you think Bob never shared any of the research with Brandon?
[P223] I've interviewed Brandon.
[P224] He's a friend of mine now.
[P225] And he did not give over any of the prior research to Brandon when he bought the ranch.
[P226] So they're starting from square one.
[P227] I don't want to speak on anybody else's behalf.
[P228] Certainly not Bob Bigelow or anybody else.
[P229] And that's probably one thing you'll notice during interviews.
[P230] I never speak for anybody else.
[P231] And I don't offer my opinion very often because that opinion could be wrong.
[P232] I'd rather stick to the facts.
[P233] But there could be one of two things.
[P234] Let's look at the full spectrum of why.
[P235] It could be that maybe Bob says, look, I don't want to predicate the science.
[P236] I don't want to prejudice, forgive me, I don't want to prejudice the science with predicated information.
[P237] Meaning, here's access to all my data and you take it from there.
[P238] Start from scratch.
[P239] So we have a fresh set of eyes on it and remain objective.
[P240] Maybe that's why.
[P241] Or it could be, hey, you know what?
[P242] I paid a lot of money and put a lot of time into this.
[P243] I consider this information proprietary.
[P244] And, you know, you...
[P245] You're going to have to figure this out yourself.
[P246] Maybe that's why.
[P247] Or maybe, I don't know, maybe because there was some government involvement, maybe he can't.
[P248] Maybe he's like, look, it's proprietary to the U.S.
[P249] All this information we did is proprietary to the U.S.
[P250] government.
[P251] I can't release it without the U.S.
[P252] government's approval.
[P253] I mean, those are just some of the what ifs.
[P254] I don't know why.
[P255] I've never had a chance to ask Mr. Fugel that question directly.
[P256] Yeah.
[P257] But I do know Bob Bigelow, and I don't think he'd ever do anything just out of spite or to be mean.
[P258] I'm sure he had a very good reason.
[P259] He's always very calculated.
[P260] I'm sure he had a very good reason for that.

[P275] This episode is sponsored by Roka.
[P276] Roka is a performance eyewear brand for people who want to invest in themselves.
[P277] Roka manufactures premium sunglasses, prescription eyeglasses, and readers, and cuts all of their lenses here in the US at their headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[P278] Roka recently partnered with one of my favorite guests, Dr. Andrew Huberman, to launch a new line of glasses called the Wind Down Collection.
[P279] Guys, I've tried these.
[P280] You know I have problems sleeping.
[P281] I absolutely love, love, love these frames and lenses.
[P282] They're available with and without prescription and have a proprietary red lens that helps filter out short wavelength light.
[P283] Short wavelength light is in pretty much all artificial light, and it's terrible for your sleep.
[P284] Roka let me try a pair of these things, and I can feel the difference whenever I wear them.
[P285] I wear them in the evening after the sun goes down.
[P286] I pretty much start it at dinner, and I wear it until bed.
[P287] And let me tell you, these things work.
[P288] With so many options and eyewear and wellness products out there, it's a relief to know the glasses I'm wearing help two things I really care about, my vision and my sleep.
[P289] And as a business owner with all the decisions I already need to make every day, wearing a pair of Roka's glasses is one of the best ones I've made.

[P291] That's Roka.com with code SRS.
[P292] So in your experience, are the things that they were experiencing, are they very similar?
[P293] Well, compared to Brandon Fugel, I think there's some overlap.
[P294] But again, I'm not really tracking now currently the Skinwalker stuff.
[P295] That's another group of folks.
[P296] It's not that I'm not interested.
[P297] I am.
[P298] I just don't have the bandwidth.
[P299] I'm simply...
[P300] As I tell people, I am dancing as fast as I can.
[P301] I cannot turn the tempo up anymore.
[P302] As fast as these legs will move.
[P303] So to spend my time and energy now on yet another portfolio, I just simply, I'd have to clone myself.
[P304] Yeah, yeah.
[P305] Well...
[P306] Lou, we have a Patreon account.
[P307] It's a subscription account.
[P308] They're our top supporters.
[P309] Good for you.
[P310] And they've been here with us since the beginning.
[P311] Fantastic.
[P312] It keeps growing.
[P313] It's a community now, and I wouldn't be sitting here without them, and neither would you be.
[P314] Great.
[P315] One thing I offer them is to ask each and every guest a question that comes on the show.
[P316] Absolutely.
[P317] This one is from Jake Gillian.
[P318] Given your unique insight into the UAP phenomena and its potential implications for humanity, what do you believe is the single most critical piece of information the public should understand about UAPs right now?
[P319] And why do you think this information has been withheld for so long?
[P320] Wow, wow.
[P321] Jake, great, great question.
[P322] So let me see if I can deconstruct this a little bit.
[P323] What is the one single aspect about the UAP topic
[P324] That should be... That the public should understand about UAPs.
[P325] Right, the public should understand and should be revealed now and understand its implications and the importance of it.
[P326] Wow.
[P327] There's not just one.
[P328] Let me see if I can break this down for Jake.
[P329] Okay.
[P330] There are fundamental reasons why you classify information by law, by law, and then later on policy as well.
[P331] Usually it's to protect two things called sources and methods.
[P332] And then sometimes you can use it to protect some other things we won't go into here.
[P333] But those are the primary reasons.
[P334] What you can't do is classify information to cover up malfeasance or illegal activities or something that might be embarrassing to the United States.
[P335] You can't do it.
[P336] It is against.
[P337] We used to do it as a nation.
[P338] And finally, Congress stepped in after all these nasty little things that we were doing, like the syphilis experiments, for example, or the CIA and the LSD experiments.
[P339] We did some pretty nasty things.
[P340] So Congress stepped in and said, no MAS.
[P341] If you're going to classify information, these are the reasons why you classify information.
[P342] And if you do it for any other reasons, you're wrong.
[P343] I don't believe that any organization, any institution, any government, any religion has the right to classify information that should be universally provided to all the people of the world and all the citizens.
[P344] Now, what do I mean by that?
[P345] Galileo Galilei, when he first proposed, looked through his telescope and first proposed the heliocentric model for our solar system, was met with so much resistance that the church almost burned him alive on the stake.
[P346] And he had to recant and say, no, I was wrong.
[P347] In fact, they even refused to look through the very telescope to prove his observations.
[P348] Now we look back, we say, well, that's silly.
[P349] Why would anybody care that the sun is the center of our solar system and not Earth, right?
[P350] Well, at the time, that information was thought to be very threatening.
[P351] to the Judeo-Christian belief system and the institutions at the time, primarily the church.
[P352] So they, you know, in essence, they tried to classify that idea.
[P353] Don't tell the world that, because this goes against what we've been telling people.
[P354] And I don't think, you know, we look back, hindsight being 20-20, we realize that was dumb.
[P355] Why would you ever do that?
[P356] Why would you stop somebody from telling the truth?
[P357] I think this topic is very much the same thing.
[P358] Look, we tell everybody in modern terms every day that North Korea has atomic capabilities.
[P359] And that's not classified.
[P360] The fact that the Earth is not the center of the solar system is not classified.
[P361] Now, what is classified is the fact that maybe North Korea, how those atomic weapons are delivered and their flight characteristics and their targets, gotcha.
[P362] And you want to keep that classified.
[P363] But the fact that North Korea has atomic weapons is not a classifiable fact.
[P364] Just like we're not alone in the cosmos.
[P365] These things are here.
[P366] It's becoming the worst kept secret.
[P367] It's now a liability.
[P368] There are two fundamental philosophies about secrets.
[P369] Some people believe secrets are like fine wine.
[P370] And the longer you keep a cork on it, the better it gets, the longer it ages.
[P371] I disagree with that.
[P372] I've told people all along since day one, secrets are perishable.
[P373] They have a shelf life.
[P374] They're like vegetables in your refrigerator.
[P375] And if you leave them in there too long, they're going to rot and they're going to stink.
[P376] And then you've got a really big mess on your hands.
[P377] So if you allow a secret to go on longer than what's necessary, it actually will start working as a liability.
[P378] against you.
[P379] And ultimately, we've seen with the JFK files, it will start to erode the faith and confidence and public trust in the very institution that secret was there to try to protect.
[P380] This is no different with the UAP topic.
[P381] It is so obvious at this point, and our adversaries know it's real too, to keep the mere fact of the existence of UAP
[P382] from from the public knowledge i think is a disservice i don't think any organization like i said or government has a right to keep that fundamental truth away from the american people that that that's that's not their business to do that now if you want to say well how these things actually work and because we obviously don't want north korea or some rogue nation having that capability to hurt us i got you but to deny the existence of it
[P383] I think that's counterproductive.
[P384] I think it actually works against trying to
[P385] to reinforce and instill faith and confidence in our government i don't think that's the way to do it i think ultimately at the end of the day everything is going to come out anyways just like we see with the jfk files um you know there's an old saying from bob marley you can fool some people sometimes but you can't fool all the people all the time and i think that's where we're at i think we now have to we have to reconcile and
[P386] And come back to the table and say, yeah, it turns out, you know, we've been investigating these things for a long time, even though we haven't told you or maybe we didn't tell Congress and we didn't even tell presidents, certain presidents, what we were doing.
[P387] Now, is that a problem?
[P388] Yes.
[P389] But we can figure that out.
[P390] We can get over that hill.
[P391] What we can't do is afford to...
[P392] to erode any more faith and confidence.
[P393] The faith and confidence right now in our government at least was at an all-time low.
[P394] Most people do not trust their government.
[P395] That's a problem in a democracy.
[P396] I'm one of them.
[P397] Hey, brother, we both served Uncle Sam.
[P398] I got you.
[P399] And sometimes if you really love something or love someone,
[P400] You have to tell them what they need to hear, not what they want to hear.
[P401] And this is a case, I think, this is why I'm having this conversation.
[P402] The government needs to hear, look, it's time for you to be honest with the American people.
[P403] I know what I was part of.
[P404] My colleagues know what they were part of.
[P405] We know what we've seen, and so do the pilots, and so do the radar operators, and so do the special operators, and so do the CIA personnel.
[P406] Cat's out of the bag, guys.
[P407] The cat is out of the bag.
[P408] So back to the question here, what is the one thing that should be revealed?
[P409] The fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.
[P410] In our 200,000 years of existence as modern Homo sapiens sapien as a species, and only really been the last 100 years we had the technology to even begin to explore our cosmos, is it possible for our search for intelligent life,
[P411] that in all that time, Earth being four and a half billion years old approximately, that intelligent life found us first?
[P412] Yeah, statistically, yeah.
[P413] And then when you look at the evidence suggesting that and reinforcing that, look, someone is flying these things around.
[P414] They are intelligently controlled.
[P415] They can outperform anything that we have.
[P416] So who's behind it?
[P417] That's fine if you don't want to consider that option.
[P418] It's either Russian, Chinese, or ours.
[P419] And it's not ours.
[P420] We've already said it's not ours.
[P421] We don't have that capability.
[P422] And we damn sure hope it's not Russian or Chinese because then we're really screwed.
[P423] No, by the way, we've been dealing with this topic now for the last, what, 70-some years?
[P424] Can you imagine?
[P425] Look, when these things, Foo Fighters, we talked a little bit about Senator Ted Stevens and Allied pilots seeing these Foo Fighters during World War II.
[P426] Let me ask you a question, Sean.
[P427] Right on the heels of World War II, we had this rash of flying saucers being seen and UFOs that were, in some cases, radar returns in the early 50s doing 10,000 to 13,000 miles an hour.
[P428] Okay?
[P429] Where were we?
[P430] Well, we had just come out of World War II.
[P431] We became the world's premier superpower.
[P432] We had barely broken the sound barrier, and we hadn't been into space, and we were transitioning from propeller to jet, to the jet age.
[P433] These things, forget about 13,000 miles an hour, we could barely break Mach 1, right?
[P434] Who had that capability at the time if we didn't?
[P435] Well...
[P436] Where was Russia?
[P437] They were just entering the atomic age themselves.
[P438] China, they're in the middle of a famine, right?
[P439] So there's no one who had that capability.
[P440] I always use this analogy.
[P441] That would be like going back into the 40s.
[P442] That would be like going into King Tut's tomb for the very first time.
[P443] And as you're breaking down the rock wall and peering into the vault, all of a sudden seeing a fully assembled 747 jet sitting in the tomb.
[P444] Temporally, it doesn't make sense.
[P445] The Egyptians did not have that technology.
[P446] So what is that aircraft doing in that tomb?
[P447] It doesn't make sense.
[P448] So, you know, there's the adage, there's two types of people in the world.
[P449] In the face of new information, you can change your opinion based upon new facts or, like some people, reject the facts and stick with your own narrative because it's more comfortable and convenient.
[P450] I think it's probably smarter and wiser in the face of new facts, we need to recalculate our thinking.
[P451] And that's why I think, back to this question here, it's important that the people know that the US government has been spending your taxpayer dollars, a lot of it, trying to research these things that are very real.
[P452] You don't spend millions and millions of dollars and billions of dollars on a wild goose chase.
[P453] You don't do it.
[P454] And hiding black budgets and things.
[P455] You do it because something's real and legit.
[P456] And I think that's where we are.
[P457] Certainly my experience in the Pentagon and the intelligence community, this is substantiated.
[P458] Well, I mean, I think a lot of people think maybe the Germans had
[P459] Some higher technology.
[P460] Well, they did.
[P461] Well, they certainly did.
[P462] We know that, right?
[P463] They had the German Wunderwaffe program, Wonder Weapon program, had the Messerschmitt, right?
[P464] The ME, what was it?
[P465] 108 ME, the first jet airplane, really, it was the Germans that came up with it.
[P466] The V1 rocket, the V2 rocket, right?
[P467] The buzz bombs and the long-range rockets.
[P468] Those were all German technologies.
[P469] In fact, with Operation Paperclip, when World War II ended, what did we do?
[P470] We stole it all and brought it here, right?
[P471] And Wernher von Braun and the Saturn V rocket.
[P472] You know, that was just, I hate to say it, but that was a glorified V2 rocket, you know?
[P473] So, yes, the Germans did.
[P474] And then they had these other very interesting programs, you know, not too dissimilar to what the Pentagon had.
[P475] They had, the Nazis had something called the Ananerva,
[P476] which really looked at some kind of far-out stuff.
[P477] Now, some people will look and say, oh, it was nothing but cult and witchcraft.
[P478] Okay, but there was enough there there, enough data to suggest that whatever they were doing worked or could help them with the war effort.
[P479] So they invested a lot of time and money into that.
[P480] And that's not just, you know, I was mentioning this because you said Germans, but other countries did the same thing.
[P481] There's other countries that were always looking for that strategic advantage.
[P482] What would it take for me to have a decisive advantage on the battlefield, in the battle space?
[P483] So people say, well, why would they spend it?
[P484] Look, our country did.
[P485] But one of my colleagues, Hal Putoff, the godfather of the U.S.
[P486] government, the CIA's psychic espionage program.
[P487] That's right.
[P488] It just said psychic espionage program.
[P489] Your tax dollars paid for programs like Stargate and Grill Flame before that and various other names before that.
[P490] Why?
[P491] Because there was some information to suggest that it worked.
[P492] And oh, by the way, the Russians were doing the same thing.
[P493] You know, so people look at things and say, well, that's silly, that would never work.
[P494] And it turns out that sometimes it does work.
[P495] Look at the Navy SOSA, your Navy guy, the Navy SOSA's program back in the 50s.
[P496] Who would have ever thought, well, I could just drop some microphones in the ocean and maybe I can listen to Russian submarines.
[P497] It worked, right?
[P498] So is it really that?
[P499] Is it pseudoscience?
[P500] Well, it's pseudoscience until it works.
[P501] Now it's just science.
[P502] I also think that maybe as Americans, we're a little arrogant thinking that nobody else could have this kind of technology because we're so advanced.
[P503] Maybe somebody else has it, and they're just not revealing it because they don't want to play the fucking world police.
[P504] We get ourselves involved in everything and...
[P505] Well, why would you want to tell somebody, look, we're in this wonderful room here, but if you're like me and sometimes paranoid, I always have contingencies.
[P506] And I have contingencies for contingencies.
[P507] So if you were a country that had some super secret technology, would you want to advertise the world that you have it?
[P508] Well, it's kind of what I'm getting at.
[P509] Right.
[P510] So it is possible.
[P511] We think we're the smartest.
[P512] Right.
[P513] Right.
[P514] But this is why I say temporally, I think now you're right, because we know that near-peer adversaries are absolutely ahead of us in certain areas.
[P515] I won't say what they are, but we know that, and it's a problem for us.
[P516] But if you go back to the end of World War II, we're really... Who are some?
[P517] Who are some that are... I can't say that.
[P518] I don't want to... I want to let our folks in government do their job, and they don't need me spewing out vulnerabilities that we might have where other countries are ahead of us.
[P519] But, you know...
[P520] Quantum computing, for example, you know, certain type of capabilities may be in space.
[P521] We have to maintain that competitive advantage.
[P522] But again, let's go back to what we originally said here.
[P523] If you look at this from a temporal perspective, time perspective, at the end of World War II, we really were the only world superpower at the time.
[P524] We had dropped the atomic bomb and decisively ended World War II.
[P525] What was referred to as the greatest generation then began to invest in the United States and became a world superpower, a dominant power.
[P526] There was no real near peer other than the Russians at the time.
[P527] And they were still nowhere near what we were able to do.
[P528] So I can buy now if you say that there is a foreign adversary that has this capability.
[P529] Okay, I doubt, but maybe.
[P530] but not 70 years ago.
[P531] And let's look at this, because Marco Rubio, the new Secretary of State, when he was Senator, said something very interesting.
[P532] He said, you know, I almost hope that these things are not human, because if they're human, that's almost more scary who's created this technology.
[P533] And I think he's absolutely correct.
[P534] To put this into perspective, we spend billions, with a B, billions of dollars each year to maintain a strategic advantage from an intelligence perspective, all 17 agencies of the intelligence community,
[P535] To know more than our enemies, right?
[P536] Now imagine if there was a country that had the ability to develop a technology and deploy this technology that could come into our country completely unimpeded, unchallenged, unseen, be able to do whatever we wanted to do.
[P537] collect ISR on our military equities, and interfere with our nuclear strategic capabilities, turn them off, right?
[P538] And then go back home, no sweat, and nobody would ever know.
[P539] That would be, and by the way, have been in development for the last 70 years on this technology, that would be the greatest intelligence failure this country has ever experienced, eclipsing that of even 9-11.
[P540] Because despite the billions of dollars that we invest, there wasn't a single indication or shred of information over 70 years that some country had managed to develop this technology.
[P541] Think of the resources and infrastructure required to develop and deploy a technology like that.
[P542] And you didn't get one shred of evidence in 70 years that country X was doing that?
[P543] Right?
[P544] So...
[P545] Choose your poison.
[P546] It's either someone else's or it's foreign adversarial.
[P547] If it's foreign adversarial, you need to fire every single person right now in national security and start from scratch.
[P548] And you better not provoke a war because we're going to lose.
[P549] So that's the other part of that argument.
[P550] If you say, okay, maybe some country did develop this in secret.
[P551] Okay, well, how?
[P552] When?
[P553] Where?
[P554] Right?
[P555] Under what circumstances?
[P556] And now China, you mean to tell me, is going to be so brazen in 2004 to fly this right off the coast of California and, oh, by the way, tangle with two F-18 Hornets?
[P557] That doesn't seem very smart.
[P558] That's certainly not where I test my secret stuff.
[P559] You know, we test our secret stuff at Area 51 of these places out of the prying eyes of people to see it.
[P560] Now, maybe it's some sort of red force probe, right?
[P561] Some provocation to see our response.
[P562] Sure, but there's also counter arguments to that as well.
[P563] So it simply doesn't make sense from a time perspective that some country had this technology 70 years ago.
[P564] Now...
[P565] Sure, maybe.
[P566] I doubt it, but I would buy that more.
[P567] Okay, yeah, China, Russia in the last five years has been able to develop this.
[P568] Look, 2004, how many people had quadcopters?
[P569] Drones didn't even really exist in 2004.
[P570] You had these fixed-wing remote-controlled airplanes that you threw in combat maybe for 15 minutes to get a sight picture on something.
[P571] What type of drones did we have?
[P572] When I was in the Army, right before 2001, we were dealing with
[P573] Model airplanes, Hunter UAVs, Pioneer UAVs.
[P574] I mean, it could be us just not revealing it, too, because, I mean, if we are that technologically advanced, then, you know, there's not really any money in that.
[P575] I think we both know that a lot of these...
[P576] The wars that we were in has to do a lot with KBR, with the military industrial complex.
[P577] I'm going to hold my comments to myself.
[P578] For that advanced, and we can end things that quickly, there's not really a lot of money in that, so they have to develop all this other shit that's advanced, but it's not really that advanced so that we can spend all our fucking money
[P579] You know what I mean?
[P580] Developing all this shit that's not at the top because if we just went straight to the top, then it just ends immediately.
[P581] Well, I think it's certainly a possibility.
[P582] You're right, Sean.
[P583] It is something we have to consider.
[P584] But again, I go back to how is the... Nobody talks about that.
[P585] No, you're right.
[P586] How is the... Well, because that gets into a very uncomfortable part of the conversation.
[P587] But it's fucking real.
[P588] Oh, I don't disagree.
[P589] It's real.
[P590] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[P591] But that can...
[P592] I'm not disagreeing.
[P593] But if you look at Blue Force capabilities and how we test Blue Force capabilities, especially sensitive capabilities.
[P594] What do you mean Blue Force capabilities?
[P595] U.S.
[P596] capabilities.
[P597] So if you look at the way we test new types of capabilities, right, for our military, for intelligence, we do it in places out of the prying eyes of eyewitnesses.
[P598] We do it in a place where it's going to be safe and I don't have to worry about a potential mid-air collision, right?
[P599] I'm not going to test this capability without letting, let's say, the fleet commander know that, hey,
[P600] While you're out there in that range, I'm going to be testing my stuff there and see how you react.
[P601] You don't do that because you could have mid-air collisions, flight safety issues.
[P602] I mean, that's why you have a joint staff to coordinate these type of things and say, look, I'm going to do an exercise.
[P603] And if I want to test a new capability, I'm going to do an Area 51.
[P604] I'm going to do it out of the prying eyes of anybody in a place that's safe.
[P605] And oh, by the way, if it crashes, I don't have to have a recovery issue on my hands, right?
[P606] Where is going to see?
[P607] And I have a big profile.
[P608] So I don't, and we've already said for the record, and certainly when I was in the government, we looked at Blue Force capabilities.
[P609] We've got some pretty cool stuff.
[P610] I'll tell you that.
[P611] I mean, even Area 51, though, it's not, you're talking right after World War II, objects going 13,000 miles.
[P612] In low Earth atmosphere, right?
[P613] That's not,
[P614] Area 51 isn't big enough to conceal something like that.
[P615] No, that's my point.
[P616] That's exactly my point.
[P617] If you're going to test a capability like that, you'll go to Antarctica if you really have to, right?
[P618] Or you're going to drop it from the bottom of B-52 at an altitude of 60,000 feet and test what you've got to test, which, by the way, you've done.
[P619] The X-15 is a perfect example.
[P620] But we do it in a way that is, it's safe and out of the prying eyes of people that are not read onto the program.
[P621] You don't test it right off the coast of California in the middle of a fleet exercise with an aircraft carrier, dozens of destroyers and support vehicles and submarines and F-18s.
[P622] You don't do that.
[P623] That's not how you conduct a classified program because too many people see it.
[P624] So I think there's an argument there to be made that obviously I would rather this technology be ours than Russian or Chinese, but I think we're pretty clear now as a government it's not our technology.
[P625] And our government has already said for the record, very senior people, this is not our technology.
[P626] So if it's not ours, it's somebody's.
[P627] Whose is it?
[P628] What's the X-15?
[P629] X-15 is a rocket-powered aircraft.
[P630] So right on the heels of the supersonic age, we had just, I think it was the X-1, was the experimental aircraft that Chuck Yeager used to break the sound barrier for the first time.
[P631] Roughly 763 miles an hour at sea level, plus or minus.
[P632] The X-15 was a hypersonic vehicle
[P633] that was to take people into space, believe it or not.
[P634] In fact, the pilots have astronaut wings.
[P635] It is a, think of a little, a long skinny pencil with stubby wings on it.
[P636] It doesn't even have landing gear, it has skids.
[P637] And it's dropped from the wing of a B-52 at high altitude and then accelerates up to hypersonic speeds and goes to the upper limits of our atmosphere and into a low Earth orbit.
[P638] In fact, if you look at that platform, the X-15,
[P639] Not only does it have wings and control surfaces, but because it flies so high, it has to have thrusters.
[P640] It's just like a rocket, just like a space shuttle.
[P641] And that was really, when you look at how we were testing, I think there were only six of those ever built.
[P642] They started off with twin 500,000 horsepower engines.
[P643] Then they switched it to a general electric 1 million horsepower engine.
[P644] And in fact, there was even a death associated with the X-15 because apparently it had an issue with telemetry.
[P645] And it flew so high that when it was coming back down to Earth, it burned up.
[P646] It didn't re-enter properly.
[P647] And unfortunately, the test pilot was killed.
[P648] But the X-15 was really our first early attempt.
[P649] And you're talking maybe 4,000 miles an hour.
[P650] So Mach 5 is hypersonics.
[P651] The definition of Mach 5 is supersonic, which is the speed of sound, faster than the speed of sound, roughly 760-some miles an hour at sea level.
[P652] Mach 5 is defined as five times the speed of sound.
[P653] So five times that speed.
[P654] So the X-15 was one of those preliminary early efforts to get into the area of hypersonics.
[P655] It was manned.
[P656] And so the X-15 was... And so when you compare that to objects that are doing 10,000, 13,000 miles an hour, and we had barely broken 4,000 miles an hour with the X-15,
[P657] Again, who had that technology?
[P658] And more importantly, who had that technology to deploy it over the United States?
[P659] Because we were seeing these things, and they've been reported over and over again since the late 1940s.
[P660] There's a very interesting document, Sean, I'll share with you, that really, I think, emphasizes, and later on in the interview, if you want me to read it to you, I will, there's a very interesting document that
[P661] and the date of that document, that really is, I think, rather profound and really demonstrates that we're not dealing with our technology or foreign adversarial technology.
[P662] Let's read it right now.
[P663] That way we don't forget.
[P664] Actually, you know what?
[P665] It's on my phone and I don't have my phone here.
[P666] Let's take a break.
[P667] One of the most important ways to stay healthy is cooking your own food.
[P668] The best way to start the new year is with a home cooked meal and Hexclad makes that easier than ever.
[P669] Hexclad are hands down the best pans I've ever used.
[P670] Hexclad makes cooking so much more convenient.
[P671] They get the performance of stainless steel and the convenience of non-stick in a single pan.
[P672] They're easy to clean, dishwasher safe, and simple to wipe off after use.
[P673] They're even oven safe, up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.

[P694] So I think, Sean, you'd be really surprised to know that there's documentation, historical documentation,
[P695] That substantiates what we've been dealing with, and we've been dealing with it for quite a while.
[P696] So if I have your permission, I'd like to read something out loud.
[P697] Yeah, let's do it.
[P698] Let's do it.
[P699] You have to forgive me.
[P700] I need my old man glasses because I am old.
[P701] This is gray, not blonde.
[P702] I'm an old timer.
[P703] I'm also a lot slower than I used to be.
[P704] Tell me about it.
[P705] Yeah.
[P706] Yeah.
[P707] I got my kid a trampoline.
[P708] I tried to burn some energy off.
[P709] I got on there thinking like, oh, yeah, this will be great.
[P710] It's terrifying, isn't it?
[P711] And dislocated my shoulder again.
[P712] Exactly.
[P713] I'm like, oh, I don't remember.
[P714] I don't remember this happening.
[P715] So I'd like to read to you just briefly a very, it's a two-page official document.
[P716] And it's the, when you look at the letterhead, it's Headquarters, United States Air Force, Washington, D.C.
[P717] With another header, the Inspector General, U.S.
[P718] Air Force, I think it's 17th District Office of Special Investigations.
[P719] Before you read, is this the one you were telling me downstairs that hasn't been released to the public yet?
[P720] Well, a lot of people don't know about it.
[P721] It has been officially released and downgraded from its classified original form through the Freedom of Information Act.
[P722] But it's been lost to a lot of people.
[P723] A lot of people don't even know where it exists, and I've got a whole bunch of these.
[P724] But let me just read you one, if I can, to kind of emphasize what I'm saying.
[P725] The subject of this memorandum, basically from the Pentagon, right?
[P726] Summary of operations of aerial phenomenon in the New Mexico area.
[P727] And I'm not going to tell you the date yet.
[P728] In the first paragraph, it was determined that the frequency of unexplained aerial phenomenon in the New Mexico area was such that an organized plan of reporting these observations should be undertaken, right?
[P729] So they're seeing so many of these, they need to start an investigation, right?
[P730] The observers of those phenomena include scientists, special agents of the Office of Special Investigations, Air Force, OSI, airline pilots, so civilian pilots, military pilots, Los Alamos security inspectors, military personnel, and many other persons of various occupations whose reliability is not questioned.
[P731] So these are the best of the best.
[P732] People have security clearances and whatnot, trained observers.
[P733] And they talk about some of the morphology of these phenomena to include disks or variations thereof.
[P734] And so in the conclusion sentence, which is paragraph six, this summary of observations of aerial phenomenon has been prepared for the purposes of reemphasizing, so obviously they wrote reports before this one, and reiterating the fact that
[P735] that phenomenon have continuously occurred in the New Mexico skies during the past 18 months and are continuing to occur.
[P736] And secondly, that these phenomenon are occurring in the vicinity of sensitive military and government installations.
[P737] Interesting.
[P738] Now, what's the date of this report?
[P739] 25 May 1950.
[P740] That's from 1950?
[P741] It is from 1950.
[P742] And there are a treasure trove of these things that anybody can look at now and see.
[P743] And this is not World According to Lou Elizondo.
[P744] I'm not telling you this.
[P745] Your government's telling you this.
[P746] Not me.
[P747] The same government that later on told people, oh, nothing to see here, folks.
[P748] In secret, they're saying there's a lot of things to see here, folks, and we've got to pay attention.
[P749] Yeah, yeah.
[P750] So therein lies the conundrum.
[P751] I wish we had recordings of people's reactions instead of these fucking typed up reports that have to sound.
[P752] Well, you can see in that last paragraph where it says, the purpose of this is to reemphasize and restate.
[P753] So you can sense the frustration that action isn't being done.
[P754] There's CIA documents that talk about how we're going to go ahead and collect information on these things.
[P755] There's radar reports, track reports, multiple radar systems.
[P756] tracking these things doing 13,000 miles an hour in a low earth atmosphere environment where the friction of air is.
[P757] Put it this way, the Lockheed YF-12A SR-71 Blackbird, when that thing is doing about 3,200 miles an hour, the entire aircraft had to be made out of titanium to keep the plane from melting because it gets so hot because it's flying at that speed.
[P758] And in fact, the coolest part of that engine on the SR-71, they played it in gold,
[P759] is 800 degrees Fahrenheit, right?
[P760] That's the heat you're talking about.
[P761] Now, that's at 3,400 miles an hour.
[P762] Imagine 13,000 miles an hour.
[P763] And by the way, by the way, no signature, no sonic boom, no acoustic signature, no contrail like you see with a jet plane when you're flying at 33,000 feet, no signature at all.
[P764] I got a question for you.
[P765] Totally.
[P766] You know, I was just thinking about the recording stuff and you've obviously been involved with a lot of this stuff.
[P767] I know you can't talk about everything, but why is it always these fucking reports that have been, you know, I mean, what about the initial interview?
[P768] Somebody goes out there and does the initial fucking interview.
[P769] Why don't we have... Where are those recordings?
[P770] Exactly.
[P771] Rather than some bullshit typed up thing.
[P772] Hey, this came from the interviewer.
[P773] They got passed to the analyst.
[P774] They got passed to the...
[P775] Whoever reports to the whoever.
[P776] Where are those initial recordings?
[P777] Are they recorded?
[P778] Well, sometimes.
[P779] Sometimes they're audio recordings.
[P780] Sometimes they're written reports.
[P781] Sometimes.
[P782] So in this particular case, as you probably already know.
[P783] That would be the most descriptive account.
[P784] Right.
[P785] Right.
[P786] Well, from one person.
[P787] Keep in mind when you want to get all the different perspectives, right?
[P788] So the idea of a report like this isn't to just give you one compelling story.
[P789] It's to take all those reports that you're getting from various, remember, pilots, OSI agents, military personnel, right?
[P790] It's in the report.
[P791] So obviously there's a lot of people reporting these things.
[P792] And so this type of report is really an amalgamation of all those reports.
[P793] to send up to headquarters.
[P794] What you don't typically do, and I can tell you this as a former special agent myself, in the field when you're taking notes and you're writing reports, you understand that the report that you're writing isn't necessarily the one that's going to go to headquarters.
[P795] The one that's going to go to headquarters is usually by the senior person who's taking all the reports and creates a comprehensive single report and says, this is what we're doing.
[P796] So that two-page memorandum that I just read portions of
[P797] There's probably hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages that are used to substantiate that one report.
[P798] So where are those documents?
[P799] Well, they're usually in the hands of the investigative agency.
[P800] So, for example, whether it's Army or the Air Force OSI, Army Counterintelligence, Air Force OSI, or Navy NCIS, right?
[P801] They don't typically share those reports because some of them are what they call law enforcement sensitive.
[P802] Some of them are intelligence sensitive.
[P803] sensitive and a lot of them are very very classified because you're talking to people in key positions who have key jobs maybe they're working on special access programs so you've got to you've got to compartmentalize that information and then in order to distribute that information up to the highest level you've got to start whittling away some of the more sensitive information say here's the salient facts here's
[P804] Here you go.
[P805] It's just like when you go to court.
[P806] I mean, I'm aware of that, you know, because of what I used to do.
[P807] Exactly.
[P808] But what I'm asking is, where do those go?
[P809] Most of them, I think, that old are probably gone.
[P810] They're supposed to be archived.
[P811] I can tell you when I—and this is, you know, God, I can't believe I'm going to say this.
[P812] This is one of my greatest—
[P813] Greatest disappointments in myself, professionally speaking.
[P814] So when I was a younger agent, one of my jobs was to go to a particular military base where they had all the old archives of classified reports, back to Korean War, Vietnam.
[P815] And there was this huge archive in the basement of a particular office on Fort Meade, I won't say where it is, where the Army and some other elements kept all their old historical reports, intelligence reports, talking to sources.
[P816] It became so big and so cumbersome that there was an effort to try to digitize all of that.
[P817] It couldn't be done.
[P818] And this was in the day and age where we didn't really have very good technology.
[P819] Everything had to be hand jammed into a machine and scan them, cataloged and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[P820] So very labor intensive.
[P821] So the army decided, okay, anything over 25 years old, unless it's obvious we need to keep it, we want you to shred it.
[P822] And so one of my jobs was to go in and
[P823] to this place, into this huge room, and go through file after file after file and shred stuff.
[P824] And now we look back and say, wait a minute, that could be considered evidence.
[P825] You're right.
[P826] But that was what we were told to do.
[P827] And it wasn't that they were trying to cover their butts.
[P828] It's just too much.
[P829] You have room after room after room of file cabinet after file cabinet of classified information that's 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 years old.
[P830] Probably what the FBI's doing right now before cash gets out.
[P831] [SPEAKER_03]: What?
[P832] I hope not.
[P833] I hope that they're not doing that.
[P834] But that's what was going on.
[P835] So I suspect a lot of this may have just been lost.
[P836] A lot of it may have been
[P837] chewed up burned up over the years shredded um you know you have people that come and go they put something in a safe a five drawer security container with an xxo 10 lock on it someone forgets a combination they drill it out oh there's some documents here go ahead and shred the documents these are from you know 25 years ago nobody cares they don't even bother to look at it um some of it just may be
[P838] that incompetence, maybe some of it is not... I'm pretty sure a lot of it's not deliberate.
[P839] People just don't know what the hell they're looking at.
[P840] They see a project code name, Blue Phoenix.
[P841] Okay, so I don't know what that is.
[P842] Obviously, it's not that important.
[P843] It's 35 years old.
[P844] Shred it.
[P845] I mean, you're an investigative guy, right?
[P846] Well, they said I used to be.
[P847] So you had mentioned ancient Egypt earlier, and it was just an analogy.
[P848] What if we went in there and there was a 747 in one of the fucking pyramids?
[P849] Look, a lot of people think that the Egyptians, the ancient whatever the tribe was, or the Peruvians, Easter Island had some kind of
[P850] that they were way more advanced than what they've been made out to be.
[P851] I mean, they still can't explain how the pyramids were made.
[P852] They got these underground caves that Graham Hancock kind of brought to life.
[P853] I think they're in Turkey.
[P854] It's like entire cities underground.
[P855] I mean, is anybody looking back at that and trying to piece any of this stuff together?
[P856] Great question.
[P857] Great question.
[P858] I think there's a lot of people on the outside of the government that certainly are.
[P859] They see... Nobody within.
[P860] Well, let me get to that.
[P861] I can't say that.
[P862] So, you know, there's a lot of people trying to find congruencies.
[P863] Can we see things...
[P864] in the old world and make some sort of analysis based upon what we know now and make, compare and contrast capabilities.
[P865] I can tell you when I was in AATIP program, several of us spent a good deal of our time looking at ancient script of human beings, whether it's ancient Sumerian and cuneiform or hieroglyphics or runes and looking at a lot of different things because several of the UAP that we were investigating
[P866] were reported to have some sort of writing on the outside.
[P867] Now that's very significant.
[P868] Writing, runes, some sort of symbols.
[P869] And so the idea was, is there a way to decipher these by looking at ancient human writing and see if there was any overlap?
[P870] Was there ever a time where maybe some of that ancient script that we have was actually influenced by an external source?
[P871] Meaning someone saw something in the sky that landed and it had these writing on and therefore that inspired...
[P872] for them to write stuff, right?
[P873] Are there any stories like that?
[P874] Are there any cave paintings that maybe ancient humans came into contact with something?
[P875] And if you look at the indigenous people here in the United States, they talk about the ant people, right?
[P876] And some of their genesis stories talks about things from out of there.
[P877] And same with the aboriginal people in Australia, some even in Africa.
[P878] A lot of them have very similar...
[P879] type genesis stories.
[P880] So one of our efforts in ATIP was to look at ancient human texts in all various forms to see if there was any correlation.
[P881] Now, interestingly enough, what the scientists that I was working with came up with, which now looking back seems obvious, but it wasn't obvious at the time, the mere fact that there is writing on some of these vehicles, whatever they are,
[P882] can allow you to formulate several conclusions.
[P883] One is, let me ask you, Sean, what do we use as humans?
[P884] What is writing for?
[P885] What do we use writing to do?
[P886] Communication, documentation.
[P887] Nonverbal communication, right?
[P888] A thought, an idea, an order, something.
[P889] I'm going to give you an order.
[P890] Write it down, right?
[P891] I'm going to tell you something.
[P892] I'm going to write it down in a document and give it to you.
[P893] It's indelible.
[P894] It's there always.
[P895] Okay.
[P896] What are we communicating?
[P897] Well, it depends.
[P898] Sometimes we're communicating, like if you go to a Jeep Jamboree and you see a sign that says, if you can read this, flip me over, I've turned over.
[P899] Or if you can read this, something went wrong, call home.
[P900] Or it could mean something else.
[P901] But it also means that whoever is using the writing, that human eyes, the way we look at eyes and the electro-optical spectrum, the way we look at data, whether it's a magazine or a report or whatever it might be,
[P902] dictionary or Bible, you have to have eyes.
[P903] That's why blind people use Braille, because they can't see.
[P904] They can't read.
[P905] So whoever wrote that, A, is smart enough to know that
[P906] They want to communicate a message.
[P907] And two, that whoever is going to read it has to have eyes of some sort, some sort of eye that can differentiate and actually see that and then interpret that as an actual message.
[P908] And so that's a huge deal because that's fundamental.
[P909] You're talking about a higher functioning brain.
[P910] Because there is no animal right now on Earth other than humans that use writing to communicate information and knowledge.
[P911] So that's a distinctly human thing that's a very high-brain-functioning thing, or at least for most people, high-functioning brain capability.
[P912] And it also means that whoever's reading it, the audience, has to have eyes.
[P913] So...
[P914] Two fundamental things, whatever is behind these things, they have eyes of some sort, some way to visually see something, recognize it, and interpret that information, and that they have a higher functioning part of the brain that can take those symbols and those symbols have a meaning.
[P915] And so that was kind of a pretty big moment for us in ATIP because we realized, hey, there's maybe a lot more similarity here than we think, right?
[P916] There's some things that we share with
[P917] That with something that seemed to be only humans can do, and now it turns out that maybe something else can do too, or someone else can do too.
[P918] So...
[P919] We do look at ancient, I know your question is more like about ancient technology and capabilities.
[P920] Not necessarily.
[P921] I mean, there's even that other, I can't, man, I'm going to butcher her last name.
[P922] Diana.
[P923] Pasulka.
[P924] Yes, Pasulka.
[P925] Yeah.
[P926] Just interviewed her not long ago.
[P927] We haven't released it yet, but I mean, she talks about a lot of the stuff, you know, within the Vatican and some of the, you know, I mean.
[P928] I've seen some of it.
[P929] Yeah, it's legit.
[P930] I had a senior academic share some information with me.
[P931] And it was in Latin, and it was a communication over 2,000 years old between a Roman soldier and a Roman general.
[P932] And the Roman shield at the time they called eclipus.
[P933] Eclipus in Latin means like eclipse, the sun, like the sun.
[P934] And they discussed there how these flaming Roman shields in the sky were following them from battle space to battle space, right?
[P935] Saucers, lenticular objects.
[P936] So think about that for a minute.
[P937] Going back to your point about ancient Egypt, look,
[P938] You're absolutely correct.
[P939] There's ancient knowledge that we don't know how it was done.
[P940] Baghdad battery.
[P941] What the hell in Iraq were they building ancient batteries for?
[P942] But that's exactly what it was.
[P943] What do you mean ancient batteries?
[P944] I don't know about that.
[P945] Oh, yeah.
[P946] Yeah, using copper and stoneware filled with a solution, probably orange juice, they're creating electric currents.
[P947] You can look it up on phone.
[P948] You can look it up on your computer.
[P949] It's called the Baghdad battery.
[P950] This is before electricity supposedly was invented, before we ever discovered something called the electromagnetic spectrum and electrons.
[P951] And millennia ago, they were using it for something.
[P952] They were creating electricity.
[P953] It's called the Baghdad battery.
[P954] That's a fact, right?
[P955] You can go.
[P956] I just came back from England.
[P957] And in the museum there, the British Museum, there's an entire Sumerian art collection there.
[P958] And there's a wall.
[P959] And I have pictures of it that depicts ancient Sumerian warriors doing what?
[P960] being frogmen, scuba diving underwater.
[P961] They had this sack that they would hold.
[P962] And there's actually depictions of these people swimming underwater, breathing with these sacks.
[P963] So, you know, it's easy to look back and say, oh, the ancient people, they were basic.
[P964] But can you build a pyramid?
[P965] I can't.
[P966] I mean, how much resources would it take now to build a pyramid?
[P967] Yeah, you can go to Las Vegas and see one that kind of looks like one, but it's not a pyramid.
[P968] You're talking millions of stones placed in an exact position, cut precisely with tooling that even to this day we have a hard time replicating.
[P969] With all the tunnels inside of it.
[P970] With all the tunnels inside of that.
[P971] Look at some of the H blocks down in Latin America, South America, in Pumapunku.
[P972] Look at... There is an ancient technology.
[P973] Look, go to Greece, and at the base of the Parthenon, you'll see these huge, huge, huge stones that even today, we're not quite sure...
[P974] Even some of our largest cranes would have that capability.
[P975] The infrastructure required is enormous.
[P976] And there's other places around the world that are just like that.
[P977] So we can turn around and say, oh, ancient societies, they were primitive.
[P978] Well, don't be so quick.
[P979] I'll give you another case in point.
[P980] There was a discovery done, talking about Egypt, about ancient mummies, where they found traces of what in their bodies?
[P981] Cocaine.
[P982] Now, cocaine doesn't grow on that continent.
[P983] It only grew in South America, the coca leaf, right?
[P984] How in the hell is our coca leaf and the derivative of, the processing of, to create cocaine found in some mummies thousands of years ago in Egypt?
[P985] So you're saying these ancient mummies were partying with cocaine?
[P986] Yeah.
[P987] Yeah.
[P988] Careful.
[P989] I don't dare party with it.
[P990] But anyways, my point is, whether it's used for medicinal purposes or whatnot.
[P991] But yes, so that is a fact.
[P992] You can see it.
[P993] They pulled the traces up.
[P994] How did that happen if these ancient trade routes didn't exist, right?
[P995] There was no crossing the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean.
[P996] So there's a lot of mystery with our ancients and our ancestors that, you know, I think it's foolhardy for us to just be dismissive and say, oh, they were primitive.
[P997] They were savages.
[P998] No, they weren't.
[P999] Look at what the Aztecs were able to do with a calendar and predict even lunar cycles and to include eclipses.
[P1000] I couldn't do that now, but yet they were able to do it.
[P1001] So I am not as dismissive, and this is why going back to AATIP and looking for UFOs, it was important for us to see if there was any context in which we could see UFOs
[P1002] Any similarity, any inspiration that might have existed between ancient man and perhaps something else.
[P1003] So there is government officials that are looking back at this stuff.
[P1004] I'm pretty sure there still are.
[P1005] I don't know if...
[P1006] I know we did.
[P1007] I can't say they are right now, but they'd be foolhardy not to.
[P1008] You have to do proper research if you really want to solve a mystery.
[P1009] Yeah.
[P1010] Now, keep in mind, let me also say, though, also in defense of some of the other folks who said we weren't interested in that very much because it didn't apply to today.
[P1011] You know as well as I do.
[P1012] You're talking to a three- or four-star general.
[P1013] I can't show up and say, hey, boss, you need to see this document from 1950.
[P1014] They don't care.
[P1015] They want to know what happened yesterday and what's happening today.
[P1016] Yeah, that's great, Lou, but I don't really care what happened 70 years ago.
[P1017] What happened to our F-18 yesterday that came into contact with the bogey?
[P1018] That's what I want to know.
[P1019] I don't give a crap about that stuff.
[P1020] I care about this.
[P1021] So there is also that, this sense of urgency.
[P1022] from an operational perspective, you know, to keep it focused.
[P1023] From a national security perspective, you're really not going to spend a whole lot of resources looking in the past as you are going to be looking into the present and trying to predict the future from a military and a national security perspective, right?
[P1024] I don't care about Japan's use of a Mitsubishi Zero back in World War II as much as I care about maybe Chinese stealth technology being used today.
[P1025] Mm-hmm.
[P1026] I mean...
[P1027] Usually I wait until the end to ask these kind of questions.
[P1028] Brother, whatever you want.
[P1029] What is this stuff?
[P1030] Is this nuts and bolts?
[P1031] I mean, I didn't realize that you were connected to Hal Puthoff.
[P1032] I've talked to Skip Atwater, Joe McMonagle.
[P1033] I've done a handful of these guys, Edwin May, Angela Ford.
[P1034] I mean, I did not realize you...
[P1035] were involved or whatever your involvement was with that.
[P1036] I mean, could this be, and I don't know what you know that you can't say, is it nuts and bolts?
[P1037] Or could this be some type of collective consciousness?
[P1038] that all of these experiencers are experiencing.
[P1039] I mean, we got Neuralink coming online, probably very soon.
[P1040] And I interviewed Andrew Huberman about, we had a little bit of a talk about that and how it would technically be possible with Neuralink to create an entire false reality, motions,
[P1041] all of your senses, touch, taste, feel, feelings, vision.
[P1042] I mean, that's one of the things Neuralink is gonna do is hopefully help blind see.
[P1043] I mean, is that a possibility?
[P1044] Is that what this could be?
[P1045] It could be everything and all of it together.
[P1046] Then we've got Grush who's coming out saying that they have crash retrievals where,
[P1047] I mean, and everything's so vague where we've recovered non-human biologics, is that the terminology that's used?
[P1048] That's the terminology we're using.
[P1049] I mean, that could be a deer carcass next to an airplane crash.
[P1050] I mean, I'm not saying that's what it is, but put a fancy term behind it, like non-human biologics.
[P1051] Okay, well, is that a dead mouse?
[P1052] I mean, it doesn't really mean anything.
[P1053] They're using non-human intelligence, NHI.
[P1054] So it's not just non-human biologics.
[P1055] It's non-human intelligence.
[P1056] What does that mean?
[P1057] Well, intelligence infers that there's a higher functioning of the brain, right?
[P1058] And there may even be... So to answer your question thoroughly, we first need to break down and have an agreement on certain terminology.
[P1059] So let's talk about, for example, consciousness.
[P1060] You hear that term used a lot, human consciousness, you know.
[P1061] But what does that mean?
[P1062] If you go to somewhere in California out by the beach and someone says, yeah, man, the world is a bud about to blossom and, you know, human consciousness, we're all together.
[P1063] Then you talk to a neuroscientist and they say, you know, it's actually a quantum process.
[P1064] It's actually probably based on quantum entanglement, and human consciousness is something that is distinctly different than human intellect and human physical sense.
[P1065] There's another part of the human being, another component that makes us human, besides a brain and a body.
[P1066] So we have to first agree with what that means.
[P1067] We also have to understand that the human being is an incredibly complex organism.
[P1068] My background is micro... I went to school professionally to be a microbiologist and an immunologist.
[P1069] So I am a disciple of science.
[P1070] Always have been, always will be.
[P1071] I was never a science fiction kid.
[P1072] I always tell people I was more of a G.I.
[P1073] Joe kid than I was a Star Wars kid.
[P1074] So I was trained in science and empirical data collection.
[P1075] the scientific methods and principles.
[P1076] And then I became an agent, right?
[P1077] Which is just a facts man kind of guy.
[P1078] Just give me the data.
[P1079] I don't care what you think.
[P1080] I don't care how you feel.
[P1081] Give me the data.
[P1082] Let's see what the data suggests.
[P1083] But I think we need to understand the notion of human consciousness.
[P1084] Our taxpayer dollars have been used to explore that idea over and over and over again because there's enough information there to suggest that there is something to this human consciousness.
[P1085] Like, again, remote viewing program with Stargate, right?
[P1086] we actually did that against the Russians, and they did it against us, and we did it against other targets.
[P1087] And to some degree, there was some real success there, despite what some people may tell you.
[P1088] It was successful.
[P1089] It might still be.
[P1090] But with that said, let's take a quick exercise on human consciousness and trying to decipher what that means.
[P1091] You said you have a daughter, right?
[P1092] [SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.
[P1093] Do you love your daughter?
[P1094] Very much.
[P1095] Absolutely, and so do I. But what if I said to you, prove it.
[P1096] prove it to me you love your daughter how do you know what it is and what is love I mean we all feel it right but how do you know you really love your daughter well you can't prove it because it's something that we all recognize as being real as part of us and our existence and our experience but it's really hard to define and you just know it and of course I love my daughter I'll do anything for my daughter I'll die for my daughter but prove it well dying for my daughter is improving I love her just proving that I'm dying
[P1097] So how do you do that?
[P1098] How do you define something that is inherently so hard to define?
[P1099] Now, take that conversation and apply it to all of human consciousness.
[P1100] What is consciousness?
[P1101] What is it even, right?
[P1102] And is it possible that human beings have something indelible beyond consciousness?
[P1103] the body and the mind, something that lives beyond, something that is greater than the physical sense and the intellectual sense.
[P1104] Look, you and I are, if you compare us to a banana, I think we share like 75% of our DNA with a banana and like 99% of it with a chimpanzee.
[P1105] But
[P1106] If you were to compare our DNA, yeah, there's some differences, but for the most part, we both have two arms, two legs, and fingers, and two eyes, and bilateral symmetry.
[P1107] So we're not really physically that different.
[P1108] And then if I asked you about your brain, well, maybe it's a brain that makes Sean Ryan who Sean Ryan is.
[P1109] Okay, but if you look at the neural pathways and you go to a neurosurgeon, they're kind of the same as mine and medulla oblongata and the frontal cortex.
[P1110] And, you know, the parts of the brain are pretty consistent throughout other humans.
[P1111] That's why we can do brain surgery.
[P1112] You know how things are wired for the most part.
[P1113] So that's not what separates us.
[P1114] What makes Sean Ryan Sean Ryan?
[P1115] What makes Sean Ryan willing to go to battle and go to war and potentially die for his country?
[P1116] Or Luis Elizondo to do what he does?
[P1117] Well, that's the question.
[P1118] Is that where human consciousness lies?
[P1119] Is that where human sentience is?
[P1120] And is that something that is shared with other higher life forms or is it specifically humans?
[P1121] I have five German shepherds, love them.
[P1122] And they all have human names.
[P1123] But let's face it, they're not really humans.
[P1124] And I talk to them like babies, because that's what we do.
[P1125] Oh, you so cute little pie, right?
[P1126] But in reality, it's a dog.
[P1127] Now, it's not a human.
[P1128] But because we are anthropomorphic creatures, because everything we do, we judge our entire sense of reality based upon what we know and who we are.
[P1129] So we superimpose that on other things that are alive, and sometimes even not alive.
[P1130] Why people refer to their boats as a her, right?
[P1131] Oh, she's a beautiful boat.
[P1132] because that's what we do innately.
[P1133] We are trying to ascribe something else with our own values and attributes.
[P1134] It's just what we do instinctually.
[P1135] So when you're dealing with something that is potentially truly non-human, truly potentially non-human and non-earthly,
[P1136] How do you deal with something like that?
[P1137] Well, the only way you know how is by ascribing human attributes to it.
[P1138] You say, well, they're maybe motivated like us and they're scared like us and they have whatever biases they have.
[P1139] We have those too.
[P1140] And it's a way for us to relate to something that is, it's a way for us to know the unknowable potentially.
[P1141] And so when we talk about human consciousness and is it possible that these things are also part of a larger relationship
[P1142] consciousness network.
[P1143] Well, it's possible.
[P1144] It's possible everything sentient has that, you know, you have societies that will refer to that as a soul or a chi or an id or whatever name you want to put on a spirit.
[P1145] But is that what it really means to be human?
[P1146] Because this is not really any different than yours.
[P1147] There's something else that makes Sean Ryan who Sean Ryan is.
[P1148] And it's not your physical self and maybe not even your brain.
[P1149] So,
[P1150] That's part of the discussion.
[P1151] And then, you know, you talked about the five fundamental senses in which we judge our environment and the universe.
[P1152] And for millennia, look, Homo sapiens sapiens in modern format has been around, talk to most anthropologists, maybe the last two to 400,000 years.
[P1153] Earth has been around for four and a half billion years.
[P1154] So modern humans have only been here in a blink of an eye.
[P1155] Really, just poof, just say, I popped in and here we are.
[P1156] We have five fundamental senses by which we judge our environment, and in fact, the way we process information.
[P1157] And if you can't touch it, taste it, hear it, smell it, et cetera,
[P1158] We don't know it's there.
[P1159] In fact, it's one of the reasons why we use radio telescopes.
[P1160] Where I live in Wyoming, beautiful, unoccluded night sky.
[P1161] You see all the stars in the heavens.
[P1162] And yet, when you look at that same part of the night sky through a radio telescope, what do you see?
[P1163] Oh, you see all sorts of new stuff.
[P1164] You see Magellanic clouds and you see nebula, things that you can't pick up with the human eye.
[P1165] In fact, most of space lies beyond our ability to directly perceive it.
[P1166] If you look at the electro-optical spectrum between red and blue, the way we see the universe, that's only 0.0035% of the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
[P1167] Again, 0.0035% of the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
[P1168] That little narrow sliver of window, that's how we perceive our reality.
[P1169] So most of reality lies beyond that.
[P1170] Imagine if you had cell phone signal, cell phone vision, and now you could see in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and you could see in FM and AM and GPS.
[P1171] Your perception of reality would be different, fundamentally different, and your awareness would be different than what it is right now.
[P1172] And then you have a scalability issue as human beings.
[P1173] If you look, I tell people, if you really want to get your mind blown, type up on Google or any search engine,
[P1174] the words pale blue dot.
[P1175] And what you're going to see is this black, inky blackness, and right in the middle, about maybe two pixels large, a little blue fuzzy dot.
[P1176] What that dot is, is when we sent out the Voyager spacecraft on one of its last commands, we told it, turn around and take a picture of home, of Earth.
[P1177] Everything you have ever known, you've ever learned, everything you've ever loved, everything you've ever feared, every person that ever lived in history, every person that ever died, ever,
[P1178] is all on that tiny little blue dot hurtling through the vacuum and inky blackness of space.
[P1179] Now, that's uncomfortable for some people to think about.
[P1180] And then when you think about the size of the universe, modern right now, most astrophysics, physicists and cosmologists agree that the visible horizon, meaning as far as we can see in any direction, from one end to the end of the universe, is about 40 billion, B billion light years.
[P1181] Now, what's a light year?
[P1182] It's the time it takes in the distance traveled by a photon of light in one year.
[P1183] So how fast does light actually travel?
[P1184] 186,000 miles per second.
[P1185] That's seven and a half times around our planet in one second.
[P1186] Multiply that to a year.
[P1187] And now multiply that to 40 billion years, right?
[P1188] That is an enormous distance.
[P1189] And that's only 10% of the actual size of the universe as predicted now by some scientists because most of the universe is too big.
[P1190] It's too far away.
[P1191] The light will never reach Earth.
[P1192] So now you're talking about a universe 100 billion light years and human beings is infinitesimally small speck right in the middle, right?
[P1193] As mind-blowing as that is,
[P1194] if you take one hydrogen atom, Avogadro's number, 6.23 or 6.28 times 10 to the negative 23 in size, that's roughly the same magnitude, order of magnitude, that atom is to us as we are to the universe.
[P1195] Meaning, we sit right in the middle of the scale of the universe.
[P1196] And mostly, we can only interact as human beings with one order of magnitude or two orders of magnitude up or down.
[P1197] Otherwise, simply the universe is too big
[P1198] Or too small.
[P1199] We will never know.
[P1200] And that's where most of reality actually lies.
[P1201] So for us to sit here and say, well, you know, these things, and it can't possibly be this, and we know nothing.
[P1202] Our perception of the universe is so limited, it's like trying to look at the Grand Canyon through a soda straw.
[P1203] It's incomprehensibly large and complex and we're always learning something new about our universe and our place in our universe.
[P1204] And so when you talk about human consciousness, I know this is a very long-winded way to have a conversation, but it's important because we don't understand consciousness.
[P1205] We don't understand how it works, right?
[P1206] If it's really part of quantum entanglement and where space and time is irrelevant, we live in a three-dimensional space with three axes, right?
[P1207] XYZ and axis plus time as a function of the fourth dimension.
[P1208] But we experience time
[P1209] Linearly, unlike space where we can experience it three-dimensionally, for the most part, human beings experience time linearly, meaning it's one way.
[P1210] But is that really the way time works?
[P1211] Well, we know time is relative because GPS satellites that have an atomic cesium clock on board, which is the exact same atomic cesium clock we have at the ground station, we started noticing something very weird.
[P1212] We had something called atomic drift, meaning depending how far the satellite was, the GPS satellite was from the surface of the Earth,
[P1213] the more there was a deviation in the time on that atomic cesium clock.
[P1214] Now, how is that possible if the atomic decay, the half-life, is exactly the same as the one on the ground?
[P1215] The reason is because time, the further you get away from a massive object, time runs at a different rate, literally at a different rate.
[P1216] And so we now know that the very notion of time isn't actually linear.
[P1217] And so I've often explained...
[P1218] human consciousness, potentially, this is just, I don't know for sure, this is kind of the way I've experienced it, and especially if you talk to some remote viewers.
[P1219] You can imagine, if I were to ask you a question, Sean, I say, Sean, give me your, give me your simplest and less than a sentence, few words as possible.
[P1220] If I were to ask you, Sean, what's your definition of the past?
[P1221] What would it be?
[P1222] And it's not a trick question.
[P1223] You answer it any way you want.
[P1224] As simply as possible.
[P1225] Definition of the past.
[P1226] Definition of the past.
[P1227] What's your definition of the past?
[P1228] Prior experience.
[P1229] Right.
[P1230] Something that already happened, right?
[P1231] It already happened.
[P1232] And by that same definition, if I ask you, Sean, what's your definition of the future?
[P1233] What would it be?
[P1234] What's going to happen.
[P1235] What's going to happen?
[P1236] It hasn't happened yet, right?
[P1237] So very simple.
[P1238] It already happened.
[P1239] It's going to happen.
[P1240] So by those definitions, if I say, define for me the present, what is it?
[P1241] Well, the present isn't a moment of time.
[P1242] It's actually a transition process where the future becomes the past.
[P1243] And it happens so quickly and so fast that it's probably measured better in playing time than in actual human seconds.
[P1244] And it's not really a point.
[P1245] It's a process.
[P1246] And so if you look at, for example...
[P1247] Let's look at a cigar where the ashes, I've used this example before, where the ashes of a cigar is the past.
[P1248] It's already been burnt up.
[P1249] That's it.
[P1250] You can't put it back together.
[P1251] The future is that part of the cigar that hasn't burned yet.
[P1252] And the present is the cherry.
[P1253] It's that moment of ignition where the tobacco is being consumed and turned into ash.
[P1254] Now, if you had the ability to look very carefully at the cherry of that cigar burning, you'd notice something very strange.
[P1255] Once you remove the glare and really focused in, you'd notice that the cherry of that cigar, the cigarette,
[P1256] is burning unevenly.
[P1257] Meaning, if you could get in there and squeeze inside and look, you would see that there are parts of that cigar that are igniting and becoming ash before other parts.
[P1258] And you can actually have parts that have not yet been consumed behind parts that have been consumed.
[P1259] There's this weird fuzziness there, and it's why some now, some physicists theorize what they call the electron cloud.
[P1260] When you and I were in school, we learned that an electron orbits an atom.
[P1261] That's not actually what's happened.
[P1262] We now realize it's a cloud.
[P1263] The electron is both there and not all at the same time.
[P1264] It's this weird duality principle because scientists believe that at that small of a level, the electrons are so small that they're actually able to zip in and out of reality.
[P1265] The fabric itself of space-time, they're so small they can zip in and out of.
[P1266] And so they're everywhere and nowhere all at the same time.
[P1267] This is kind of more into the more quantum physics models of our understanding of the very, very small of our universe.
[P1268] It may even apply to the very, very large, but also may apply to human consciousness, which may explain why we invested so much time and money into things like remote viewing, because if my brain is quantumly connected to your brain,
[P1269] then it doesn't matter how far away you are or what time it is, we can always connect.
[P1270] And maybe that is, as some neuroscientists have speculated, that human consciousness is actually a quantum process.
[P1271] It's actually, your brain is like a quantum computer.
[P1272] And that's where, that's the realm, that's the domain in which human consciousness lives.
[P1273] And if that's the case, is it possible other higher forms of life...
[P1274] also have that ability, and that is actually not unique at all.
[P1275] In fact, when you see two dogs enter a room, some have speculated, there's some sort of nonverbal communication going on.
[P1276] We don't understand it, but they do.
[P1277] And is it possible that human consciousness is really not that unique or special?
[P1278] In fact, many forms of life share that consciousness, a consciousness, and have the ability to communicate.
[P1279] Maybe things like remote viewing are actually vestigial capabilities, meaning...
[P1280] It's nothing new.
[P1281] We're not evolving to become superhumans.
[P1282] We've always had this.
[P1283] In fact, before we had verbal communication that is now global in virtually any language I can look up and translate, perhaps it was a survival technique.
[P1284] Perhaps we needed this type of ability to communicate
[P1285] and transmit information for our very survival.
[P1286] Well, Joe McMonagle talks about this a little bit.
[P1287] When I interviewed him, he talks about before there was language, before there was pointing and grunting, that basically language has made us a lot more, not as efficient as we used to be.
[P1288] Correct.
[P1289] And that the communications, while there were no words, it was a lot more efficient.
[P1290] I knew what you were thinking, you knew what I was thinking.
[P1291] Look, people say, well, that's a bunch of hooey.
[P1292] We're doing it now.
[P1293] We can put on helmets and you can have an Air Force pilot sitting in a room with his thoughts be able to fly a drone.
[P1294] Talk about video games and these people that are really good gamers.
[P1295] It was only a few months ago that a gentleman, a quadriplegic, had a chip put in his brain, and now he can play Call of Duty, of all games, better than most professional Call of Duty players.
[P1296] Why?
[P1297] Because it's a direct interface between thought to action.
[P1298] There's no neurons and neural pathways and having to translate things.
[P1299] electrical signals into motor signals, right, which is inefficient.
[P1300] It's just direct, boom, brain to the interface to the game, which is arguably much more efficient, much faster.
[P1301] Would that not be the preferred way if you had an ability, I'm seeing this wonderful portrait of you in a helicopter up there, imagine being able to fly that helicopter without ever having to touch anything, and it's instant.
[P1302] That helicopter goes exactly where you want it to go, when you want it to go, and how you want it to go, right?
[P1303] All with
[P1304] Well, technology, don't look now, but we're getting close to that now.
[P1305] We can almost do that now.
[P1306] You have technical interfaces that are helping people do things now that were never even imaginable five years ago.
[P1307] So we're almost there now.
[P1308] Here's something I'd love to tell us Americans to get better at this year.
[P1309] Something that our international friends beat us at in spades, speaking more than one language.

[P1349] Hey, buddy, have you seen the news lately?
[P1350] I think you're right.
[P1351] And I think going back to the original question you had, which is, I know, forgive me, way, way, way around, but it's important because we're talking about, you asked me, is this technological?
[P1352] Is it consciousness?
[P1353] Could this all be related?
[P1354] What do I think about when people say that?
[P1355] You know, we have to, there's a lot we have to unpack here.
[P1356] We have to discuss what is consciousness.
[P1357] Is it something that is universal or is it just for humans?
[P1358] And is it the thing that mainly makes life life?
[P1359] And those are all really relevant questions.
[P1360] I can't answer that because I simply don't know.
[P1361] All I can do is provide for you my own experiences and some of the work that we did in ATIP and some other efforts, but...
[P1362] But I think the jury is still out.
[P1363] And I think in order to have that conversation, we first of all have to agree what it means.
[P1364] Even terms like something like consciousness.
[P1365] Because different people will interpret that word to mean something else.
[P1366] It's like love, right?
[P1367] I love my job.
[P1368] I love my car.
[P1369] Well, I love my kids.
[P1370] Well, that's a different type of love.
[P1371] Well, wait a minute.
[P1372] Love is love.
[P1373] No, it's not.
[P1374] Love isn't love.
[P1375] I love chocolate.
[P1376] But I don't love chocolate like I love my kids, right?
[P1377] And I love my wife differently than I love other folks and other things.
[P1378] So maybe consciousness is the same way.
[P1379] Maybe there's not a single definition for what consciousness is.
[P1380] And I think that's part of it because we're trying to talk the same language.
[P1381] But in there, some of those words don't have the same universal meaning for every one of us, if that makes sense.
[P1382] It does make sense.
[P1383] How involved were you with the Stargate program?
[P1384] What I'm comfortable to talk about is that early in my career, I was brought into a very interesting program.
[P1385] The gentleman's name was Eugene Lessman.
[P1386] He was probably the top at the time, the top remote viewer for the United States Army.
[P1387] And that was my first experience.
[P1388] I was brought into a very strange program early in my career after getting out of the Army.
[P1389] I didn't understand it.
[P1390] I didn't know what they wanted from me.
[P1391] Eugene had me do some things, I guess, to test if I was a good candidate.
[P1392] And then very shortly thereafter, the program had the plug pulled, the funding was pulled.
[P1393] um permanently and i wound up having a regular normal job so you were going to be a remote viewer uh well they were i got trained to do some of it you know i didn't say i was a good one there's guys out there a lot better gals a lot better than i was but but i can tell you it works um and hal putoff if you i'm not gonna if you ever interview hal putoff
[P1394] Say, hey, Lou, wanted me to ask you about the whole DC metro incident on the red line.
[P1395] And let him tell you the story.
[P1396] Maybe you can connect me with him.
[P1397] Absolutely.
[P1398] Absolutely.
[P1399] Yeah, he's an incredible human being.
[P1400] Him, another person, if you ever could get Dr. Kit Green, Christopher Green, we call him Kit.
[P1401] Kit worked with me and Hal worked with me on ATIP.
[P1402] You know, the U.S.
[P1403] government has had a long interest in remote viewing.
[P1404] I know some people find it funny, but... We didn't stop that.
[P1405] I can't... I would not be able to elaborate if there's any programs that exist or don't exist anymore, but... Well, I'm not right on that.
[P1406] Look, it makes sense that if something works, you don't stop it.
[P1407] I know we didn't stop that.
[P1408] But, I mean, where I was going is, what do you make about...
[P1409] I mean, Edwin May said that, I believe he's, don't quote me on this, you can go back and look the interview up, but I believe Edwin May told me that,
[P1410] remote viewers only correct less than 40% of the time.
[P1411] Well, what's correct, right?
[P1412] So if you ask me to predict a lottery number... He says what's correct is what can be verified, which I tend to agree with.
[P1413] Sure.
[P1414] And Joe had two that stick out to me.
[P1415] He remote viewed a mountain in Alaska.
[P1416] I believe it was in Alaska where they said that he remote viewed...
[P1417] some kind of non-human beings inside of a mountain.
[P1418] Sounded basically like some type of a space center.
[P1419] How about this?
[P1420] Let me ask you this, Sean, and we'll get back to that, because Joe McMongol and those guys really know their shit, their stuff.
[P1421] Let me ask you something.
[P1422] Let's say someone remote viewed you and said...
[P1423] You got into a motorcycle accident when you were younger.
[P1424] It was a pretty bad motorcycle accident, total your motorcycle, and it was an Enduro Yamaha motorcycle.
[P1425] And you turn around and you said, no, actually, it was a Honda or a Kawasaki.
[P1426] [SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.
[P1427] Is that person right or wrong?
[P1428] They didn't get Kawasaki right, but they got everything else right to include the injury that you sustained and the fact that you total your little Enduro motorcycle.
[P1429] So this is my point when they say, well, they weren't accurate.
[P1430] Well, what's accurate?
[P1431] That they got 90% of it right and 10% wrong?
[P1432] So, again, it goes back to the metric that's being used to say if something's right.
[P1433] I will tell you that in my experience, some of this, yeah, some of this stuff was off, off target.
[P1434] But some of this stuff was dead on.
[P1435] And I mean dead on.
[P1436] To the point where the United States actually successfully located a downed Russian supersonic test plane that was being flown, and it crashed over the Congo, over in Africa.
[P1437] And no matter what, all the satellites we used and airplanes, we couldn't find it, and neither could the Russians.
[P1438] Who found it?
[P1439] Remote viewers.
[P1440] Look at the story behind General Dozier and Brigada Rosa, Red Brigade, and the killing of Aldo Moro, who was at the time the president of Italy, and then they captured and they kidnapped General Dozier.
[P1441] And they were going to kill him.
[P1442] And remote viewers got pretty close to being able to locate him.
[P1443] If you look at what they were doing, they got damn close.
[P1444] And some actually say that's the reason why he was saved.
[P1445] Remote viewing can be very effective.
[P1446] But it's like any other collection data point.
[P1447] There's bias.
[P1448] There's collection bias, and then you also have other issues.
[P1449] You have interference.
[P1450] That's why I say remote viewing should never be taken as a single source intelligence capability.
[P1451] It should be there as an additive capability.
[P1452] Just like when you're collecting intelligence now, you have a human source, but you never just go with humans.
[P1453] You go with SIGINT, you go with ELINT, you go with...
[P1454] Whatever other ints you need, intelligence collection capabilities, to bolster or to negate pieces of information that you're receiving.
[P1455] You never want to take single source reporting.
[P1456] You always want to have a comprehensive capability that has multiple sources of feeds of information, and then you base your conclusions off of that data.
[P1457] So what do you make of stuff like that mountain?
[P1458] Which I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
[P1459] I do know what you're talking about.
[P1460] What do you make of that?
[P1461] You know, I find it interesting.
[P1462] There's people who have remote-viewed stuff in Antarctica, people that have remote-viewed stuff.
[P1463] I mean, Joe remote-viewed Mars at, I can't remember the years.
[P1464] He's not the only one.
[P1465] 2 or 3,000 B.C., the pyramid.
[P1466] You know what I'm talking about?
[P1467] Yeah, I mean, there's a book, really interesting book.
[P1468] This really all kind of blew up when there was an Army captain, his ranger,
[P1469] sustained a TBI in an exercise, I think it would have been Bright Star in Egypt.
[P1470] And he had a wound to his head.
[P1471] I think it was caused by a grazed bullet that caused some damage.
[P1472] And he was on his way to getting out of the army because he said he saw things and he thought they were hallucinations.
[P1473] And long story short, he got actually recruited into the Stargate program, because he was actually a very good remote viewer.
[P1474] And the name of the book is called Psychic Warrior.
[P1475] I don't believe the gentleman is practicing anymore.
[P1476] I think he may have had some complications as a result of it.
[P1477] But that was really the first book that came out that really kind of revealed the Stargate program and kind of the day-to-day operations of what they were doing and what we were trying to find and the type of things that were going on.
[P1478] So if you want an interesting book to read or anybody in your audience that listens, pick up the book Psychic Warrior.
[P1479] I'm not promoting, by the way, I'm not promoting it's a good book or it's a bad book, but it's an interesting way to kind of get a sneak peek behind what some of the people in the government, our government, our intelligence community were doing, both CIA and DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, and even the Bureau to some degree, believe it or not.
[P1480] were involved with regarding remote viewing.
[P1481] It can be very effective.
[P1482] I mean, the Mars thing, I mean, and the Alaska thing, it didn't sound like there was a lot of follow-up on that.
[P1483] Well, because now we have technology, right?
[P1484] We can confirm by sending probes to the Moon and to Mars and other things to substantiate if what the remote viewer is seeing is accurate.
[P1485] So again... Was there any follow-up?
[P1486] So if there was, I wasn't part of that.
[P1487] That was significantly before my time.
[P1488] Now, there was a very interesting... Boy, how am I getting mad at me for this?
[P1489] No, I can talk about this.
[P1490] So as a result of remote viewing, some of these reports were very classified.
[P1491] There was one particular incident with an individual...
[P1492] It might have been with Ingo Swann, actually, if I'm not mistaken.
[P1493] I might be mistaken, so let me just caveat.
[P1494] It was with a very good remote viewer where their target was a Russian submarine.
[P1495] And they were providing the description on this new, it might have been a Typhoon-class submarine, I don't know, probably before that.
[P1496] But it was one of the latest new submarines that the Russians was deploying.
[P1497] This was Joe.
[P1498] And you, well, did you find out what was following the nuclear submarine?
[P1499] No.
[P1500] UAP.
[P1501] No shit.
[P1502] I said, well, that's interesting.
[P1503] They're like, well, what else do you say?
[P1504] Well, that's interesting, but do you want to know what's following it?
[P1505] They're like, yeah.
[P1506] And he goes, there's a UFO following the sub.
[P1507] Yeah.
[P1508] So people like Hal Pudoff, who I consider a national treasure, talked to him.
[P1509] Talk to him if you can, because he's not getting any younger.
[P1510] He really is an American patriot that did a lot for his country, took a lot of crap for what he was doing.
[P1511] He got accused of all sorts of nonsensical crap from his haters, something I think we both can appreciate quite a bit.
[P1512] But in reality, he did a lot for his country, and a lot of that was extremely, extremely successful, and the fidelity of the information was right on the money.
[P1513] Interesting.
[P1514] It's a fascinating subject.
[P1515] Quantum entanglement.
[P1516] Well, look, I'm not a quantum physicist.
[P1517] I didn't sleep at a Holiday Inn Express, but I'm not a quantum physicist.
[P1518] I would talk to folks like that, talk to maybe Eric Davis, Dr. Eric Davis as well, Hal Puthoff, Kit Green.
[P1519] Kit Green is also a medical doctor who understands things very, very well from a biological and medical perspective.
[P1520] And I'm sure he has his opinions on that as well.
[P1521] What was Davis' name?
[P1522] Eric Davis.
[P1523] Dr. Hal Pudoff, Dr. Eric Davis, and Dr. Kit Green.
[P1524] By the way, all of them patriots, all of them great, great work for our country.
[P1525] All right, let's... Got a little sidetracked there.
[P1526] Maybe I'll actually hit this outline eventually.
[P1527] But, you know, let's talk about your involvement in Army Intelligence and how you got involved with AATIP.
[P1528] Sure.
[P1529] How did that happen?
[P1530] Well, they weren't the same.
[P1531] It wasn't the same journey.
[P1532] So I grew up... I think I kind of mentioned I had a bit of a dysfunctional upbringing.
[P1533] My...
[P1534] To tell you about how I got here, I need to really tell you about who I was and how I started.
[P1535] So my father was a revolutionary.
[P1536] He was a revolutionary in Cuba.
[P1537] At the time, there was this dictator named Batista, Batista in Cuba, and there were some corruption issues.
[P1538] So my father with some other people, people like Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, realized that Batista wasn't good for the country.
[P1539] So they trained in the mountains and they overthrew the country in a coup.
[P1540] And Castro had promised freedom and democracy and elections and had a little bit of support from the US government to do that.
[P1541] And he took over.
[P1542] And when he took over,
[P1543] He very quickly turned and pronounced himself pretty much president for life, which is a dictator, not a president.
[P1544] And he sided with the Russians.
[P1545] And that was a problem.
[P1546] So my father basically telling his friends, hey, this is not what I signed up for.
[P1547] He said he was going to offer freedom and democracy and instead he's just as bad as Batista.
[P1548] So my father told his family that he was going to the United States to study English.
[P1549] Instead went to Orlando, talked to some people in the CIA, joined the revolution.
[P1550] Brigade 2506.
[P1551] Brigada 2506.
[P1552] And so he went to Guatemala, trained in the jungles of Guatemala, and then was on the USS Houston boat that went from Guatemala for the invasion of Cuba.
[P1553] They landed on the beach, and my father was subsequently captured.
[P1554] And for about two years spent his time in Castro's prisons.
[P1555] The last one was called Isla de la Pinos, Isle of the Pines.
[P1556] Where my father had he had a tooth that had I guess become It had erupted and he had an infection so they did surgery on him without anesthesia and For food they they ate boiled horse hoof right so really bad experience long story short two years later he comes to the United States and
[P1557] My mom and him have what they call, my dad always called it the romance of the century.
[P1558] My mother was this beautiful bombshell model.
[P1559] She worked as a Playboy bunny.
[P1560] She was a model.
[P1561] Are you serious?
[P1562] Yeah.
[P1563] While you were alive?
[P1564] No, no, this is leading up to me.
[P1565] And so they were, my mother was this beautiful bombshell, very free spirit, and she had a really troubled past herself.
[P1566] So never liked to talk about her family.
[P1567] met this young, dashing Cuban revolutionary, and they fell in love.
[P1568] And although, interestingly, they never officially got married, I found out later, even though they said they were married, they never were married.
[P1569] So...
[P1570] As a young kid, I remember living in a wonderful, wonderful, loving family environment until it wasn't.
[P1571] My father, you know, for 30 minutes of the day, they had, again, the romance of the century.
[P1572] The other 23 and a half hours were hell.
[P1573] My father and mother fought very violent,
[P1574] And then when the marriage finally ended and they divorced, my whole world went upside down.
[P1575] The bank repossessed the house my mother and I were living in.
[P1576] I had to sell my clothes at a flea market so my mom could pay rent.
[P1577] male figures in and out of her life she struggled she struggled so much my father went from being very successful entrepreneur and restauranteur to now working in a wood factory and i was making more as a bus boy at red lobster than my father was making um at the wood factory and they were living separately and i was caught in the middle i went to big public school really bad for me bullied bad bad bad bad i i was
[P1578] I was a pretty interesting kid.
[P1579] So because of that, I got angry.
[P1580] And one day I decided, if I'm going to get beat up, I might as well grab one of these guys with me and take them down, I guess.
[P1581] And I did.
[P1582] And I got in trouble at school for it.
[P1583] But that was very empowering for me because I never liked bullies.
[P1584] I hated it, but I was too afraid to do anything about it.
[P1585] And so one day I fought back and I fought back hard and I realized I was pretty good at it and I started fighting a lot, too much.
[P1586] And in my public school, I wasn't very popular.
[P1587] Really rough, really dark times for me.
[P1588] Bounced around a lot, many different homes.
[P1589] I was angry and I joined JROTC.
[P1590] Now JROTC at the time is what it is now.
[P1591] I went to a big public school.
[P1592] I went to a school that was still engaged in the now controversial practice of called busing, where they would take kids from different parts of the socio-demographics and underprivileged kids and they would bus them into a different school to try to give them opportunity.
[P1593] So ROTC was kind of a last ditch effort.
[P1594] If you were a bad kid getting in trouble all the time, you were kind of forced into ROTC, I guess for discipline reasons.
[P1595] And so most people
[P1596] If you weren't, you know, a popular kid and a jock and, you know, you went to RSC or you went to juvenile hall.
[P1597] Really, it was kind of that way.
[P1598] I had a different experience.
[P1599] I all of a sudden met people that felt just like me.
[P1600] And we had this sense of camaraderie.
[P1601] And I found strength in that.
[P1602] And I loved it.
[P1603] And it was the military that I realized would save me.
[P1604] And it would teach me how not to be.
[P1605] And so I went into college, very poor.
[P1606] So I had to pay for it.
[P1607] So I became a bouncer at a lot of the various nightclubs.
[P1608] I convinced myself I would take those jobs because I could go to school during the day and then I could make money at night, cash under the table.
[P1609] And that was the way I was going to support myself through college.
[P1610] The reality is,
[P1611] It was an excuse to fight.
[P1612] And I didn't realize until I got older and I got more mature and I realized why I was doing what I was doing.
[P1613] I was still very angry.
[P1614] And I just wanted to teach bullies a lesson.
[P1615] I had a lot of hurt inside.
[P1616] How did you come to that realization?
[P1617] Oh, fatherhood, marriage, time.
[P1618] I was an angry young man for a very good portion of my younger years.
[P1619] And it was...
[P1620] You know, anger can be like rocket fuel.
[P1621] It's very volatile, and you can use it to really propel yourself.
[P1622] But also, it's like rocket fuel.
[P1623] It's very caustic.
[P1624] It can eat you up inside.
[P1625] It's like acid.
[P1626] And over time, it can destroy yourself.
[P1627] And I realized that, that I needed to do so.
[P1628] I needed to figure this out because my motivation for doing things
[P1629] while I would tell myself one thing was really for some other reason.
[P1630] You know, self-delusion can really be a powerful thing when you're younger.
[P1631] So I went to college, studied microbiology and immunology for the wrong, again, the wrong reasons.
[P1632] I was told by my family who had at that point kind of disowned me, extended family, like, oh, he'll never make it to college.
[P1633] And if he does, he'll never make it past his first semester.
[P1634] So I chose the hardest major.
[P1635] I said, fine.
[P1636] I'm going to go into the medical program.
[P1637] I'm going to be a microbiologist and an immunologist.
[P1638] You?
[P1639] Yeah.
[P1640] That's what I'm going to do.
[P1641] And so I did.
[P1642] Again, motivated for the wrong reasons.
[P1643] Fortunately, it worked out to my benefit.
[P1644] I actually enjoyed it a lot.
[P1645] And used some of that later on in my life and my career.
[P1646] So finishing college, I was in a lot of debt.
[P1647] Really not a whole lot of options.
[P1648] I didn't want to spend the rest of my life looking through a Petri dish and a microscope.
[P1649] So...
[P1650] I joined the army.
[P1651] Now what I didn't say is early on when I was a young man in high school and before that as a young, even seven years old, my father had this idea that I would join the new revolution, Alpha 66 and retake Cuba.
[P1652] So me and myself and some other kids were always taught weird paramilitary skills.
[P1653] how to disassemble a Kalashnikov and what's the difference between a 223 or a 5.6 and a 6.2 by 37 versus 39.
[P1654] And my dad, when I was eight, taught me how to fly a plane.
[P1655] By 11, I was scuba diving.
[P1656] How to build explosives and provide explosive devices in the kitchen using household products.
[P1657] Like really weird stuff that's not healthy for a kid to learn.
[P1658] But my father had this desire, I guess,
[P1659] for me to accomplish the mission that was his mission.
[P1660] It was never really my mission, but I think he felt that somehow that I would, I would, I would do it and, and, and help liberate Cuba.
[P1661] That was his, that was his number one prerogative for ever since I can remember as a kid.
[P1662] And he was volatile, man.
[P1663] He was volcanic.
[P1664] When he blew up, man, he would, someone was going to jail and it was usually my dad.
[P1665] Um,
[P1666] He was very intellectual and very smart, but he was also exceedingly volatile.
[P1667] And as a kid, I was terrified of my father because of that, because he was unpredictable.
[P1668] And I didn't want to be like that.
[P1669] I wanted to be like my father, but I didn't, if that makes sense.
[P1670] I wanted to be like the good parts of my father, but I didn't want to be like that, like the anger.
[P1671] And I was turning out to be that way.
[P1672] I was doing the same things, finding excuses to get into fights and kick people's butts.
[P1673] And it wasn't healthy, and all for the wrong reasons.
[P1674] So after college, I went into the Army.
[P1675] had an opportunity to go in as an officer because of my college degree, and my father's words were always ringing in the back of my head and in my ears.
[P1676] He said, look, son, if you want to be a leader, you first must know what it means to follow.
[P1677] So I enlisted.
[P1678] Enlisted in the Army.
[P1679] And...
[P1680] Had a chance to learn some stuff in the Army.
[P1681] Very short period of time.
[P1682] People will always go back and say, oh, you're this hero.
[P1683] No, I'm not a hero.
[P1684] I know I'm not a hero because I know what a real hero is.
[P1685] And most of those heroes aren't here to tell their story.
[P1686] I suffer from really bad imposter syndrome because people see you in uniform.
[P1687] They see the pictures of you in various situations.
[P1688] And they're like, oh, my God, you're so brave.
[P1689] No, there's people out there that had a hell of a lot worse that did a lot more than me.
[P1690] You know, the real heroes are the guys and gals that aren't here to tell their story.
[P1691] It's the families that are left behind that have to have the Christmases and birthdays without the service member and going to PTA meetings and cooking dinners every night and doing homework.
[P1692] Those are the heroes.
[P1693] What I did was easy, comparatively speaking.
[P1694] You know, the real hero is the female helicopter pilot who's low on fuel, but she's not going to leave her little ducklings behind so she continues to stay on the LZ and stay and stay and stay and takes round after round after round until finally the helicopter gets shot down out of the sky.
[P1695] Right?
[P1696] That's the hero.
[P1697] So all this other bullshit and people come by, oh, Lou, you're a hero.
[P1698] Save that shit for somebody who actually believes it.
[P1699] I'm not a hero.
[P1700] I'm just a patriot doing this job.
[P1701] Um...
[P1702] So long story short, in the Army for a little bit, and then I got recruited out of there into a special program.
[P1703] They called it special.
[P1704] Maybe it was, but for different reasons.
[P1705] I am proof you do not have to be intelligent to be an intelligence.
[P1706] Let me just say that.
[P1707] But it was an opportunity that I relished.
[P1708] So I joined a special activities program.
[P1709] Did that for a while.
[P1710] During that process of the recruitment is when Gene Lesman came into my life, and I learned...
[P1711] A little bit about the remote viewing program, you might say.
[P1712] And then spent my time early in my career doing counterinsurgency, counter guerrilla operations.
[P1713] and some counter-narcotic support, mostly against, in Latin America, because my language being Spanish.
[P1714] So think of FARC, right, and ELN, and Tupac Amaru's, and Sandero Luminoso, and stuff like that.
[P1715] You're probably too young for this, but we had something called Plan Colombia that was arguably probably not so effective.
[P1716] What was that?
[P1717] Plan Colombia was a U.S.
[P1718] government effort
[P1719] Usually with Charlie III and the 7th Special Forces, there was a DMZ area, demilitarized zone, between Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolución de Colombia, FARC.
[P1720] It's a terrorist organization.
[P1721] They call themselves guerrillas, but they did bad stuff, kidnappings and dope and stuff like that.
[P1722] So there was this demilitarized zone, and you had these three areas, Tres Esquinas, API, and La Randia, where these cities where we had SF and Intel people doing...
[P1723] counter-insurgency, counter-narcotics missions, where we were trying to pump in a lot of American resources and money and support to help the Colombian government get rid of the FARC.
[P1724] Again, this is back in the days.
[P1725] So this is, you know, late 90s, stuff like that.
[P1726] So we were involved in stuff like that.
[P1727] Then, long story short, a little later, 9-11 happened.
[P1728] And very shortly thereafter, I found myself in some weird...
[P1729] place in the middle of nowhere in uzbekistan called k2 kashikan about it and uh yeah you probably remember that place a bit uh it was uh it was crazy spent a little time there and what were you doing there uh prepping to go down south we were we were i was only there for maybe four or five days and then i was making smoking into kandahar uh back in 2001. anyways long story short i i digress um
[P1730] Spent the next years and years after that.
[P1731] Who were you attached to back then?
[P1732] Special agent.
[P1733] So we were with J. Sodef Dagger.
[P1734] Okay.
[P1735] So we had a small intel.
[P1736] That's where I met General Mattis for the first time.
[P1737] Incredible human being.
[P1738] Nice.
[P1739] Yeah.
[P1740] But anyways, long story short, found myself there in the Middle East quite a bit.
[P1741] And then Iraq kicked off and I did some work with that effort.
[P1742] And then...
[P1743] I wound up promoting myself to a desk job.
[P1744] So I went from being a special agent in charge and running counterintelligence, counterespionage, counterterrorism operations, some cross-border operations stuff,
[P1745] And to getting a job in D.C.
[P1746] Kind of what happens, you get promoted to a point where they pull you out of the field and it's like, okay, now you're going to manage budgets, right?
[P1747] And stuff like that and personnel.
[P1748] So I did that.
[P1749] And then it was in 2008, I was at the time with Director of National Intelligence as a senior intel official there.
[P1750] And the commute was killing me.
[P1751] I lived on this little tiny island called Kent Island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay, which was great to raise a family, right?
[P1752] Having daughters, kind of give them a normal life.
[P1753] They can ride their bikes.
[P1754] You don't have to worry about crazy people in the town.
[P1755] But my commute was terrible.
[P1756] So if you know a little bit where the direct DNI is, it's actually past the CIA.
[P1757] It's right past Langley.
[P1758] And the commute was like three hours each way from me.
[P1759] And so I was sometimes in the car getting and coming from work than I was actually at work.
[P1760] It was brutal.
[P1761] So I had an opportunity to come back to the Pentagon for a one-year JDA, joint duty assignment.
[P1762] And that's when Clapper's like, you know, I need somebody to run law enforcement and intelligence integration.
[P1763] We want to get local law enforcement somehow figure out how do we get national level intelligence counterterrorism information that's classified down to a level where people can do something with it, but they don't have a security clearance.
[P1764] So how do you do it, right?
[P1765] So you create this terror line and stuff like that.
[P1766] So I was brought back for that.
[P1767] And very immediately there afterwards is two people came in to my office.
[P1768] I was in Crystal City at the time at a particular location.
[P1769] They still don't want me to talk about, so I won't.
[P1770] But beautiful corner office.
[P1771] And...
[P1772] Two people come in, talk to me and say, hey, you know, you've got some background in this and that.
[P1773] And early in my career, I forgot to tell you this, I did some work on UASs, so unmanned aerial systems.
[P1774] So drones, all the different types of drones that we had at the time, which were fundamentally pretty basic, actually.
[P1775] I did some advanced avionics protection and technology, high-energy laser technology, first stage, second stage, solid and liquid rocket booster motor engines, some space platforms.
[P1776] So when they came and talked to me, they said, hey, we know you have a CI background, and we'd like you to consider working with us in a special project.
[P1777] Didn't know at all what it was, had no idea.
[P1778] And after several of those meetings, I said, look, our director would like to meet you.
[P1779] So I said, okay, sure.
[P1780] We set up a meeting and I went to another undisclosed location where they were, he was at.
[P1781] I remember going up there, and it was so bizarre.
[P1782] The epitome of a true, whatever you think a rocket scientist in your brain, that's who this guy was.
[P1783] Kind of disheveled hair, tie a little crooked, glasses.
[P1784] And he happened to be, at the time, the U.S.
[P1785] government's premier rocket scientist.
[P1786] Like, for real, real.
[P1787] Like, the best rocket scientist in the U.S.
[P1788] government.
[P1789] Super, super, super smart.
[P1790] And we had our conversation.
[P1791] Then he looked at me towards the very end.
[P1792] He says, so I got to ask you.
[P1793] Yeah.
[P1794] He says, what do you think about UFOs?
[P1795] So I thought about it and I looked at him.
[P1796] I told him the truth.
[P1797] I don't.
[P1798] He says, well, what do you mean?
[P1799] You don't believe in him?
[P1800] I didn't say that.
[P1801] You asked me, what do I think about UFOs?
[P1802] My response is I don't think about them because I don't have the time.
[P1803] I don't have the luxury.
[P1804] I'm too busy, you know, doing other stuff and chasing bad guys and stuff like that.
[P1805] I don't think about them.
[P1806] And he looked at me and he said, that's fair enough.
[P1807] He said, but let me give you some advice.
[P1808] Actually, he might have even said, let me warn you.
[P1809] He says, don't let your analytic bias get the best of you.
[P1810] Because what you learn here may challenge that.
[P1811] And at this point, I still didn't know what they were looking at.
[P1812] I had no idea.
[P1813] But he just said UFO out of the blue.
[P1814] I'm like, what?
[P1815] And this whole time, the two people that had come to my office were telling me, this is very sensitive.
[P1816] This is very sensitive.
[P1817] We can't tell you what it's about.
[P1818] But our boss can.
[P1819] And they needed somebody with counterintelligence experience to run the counterintelligence and security aspect for their portfolio because they were worried that the Russians and Chinese were trying to expose them, which I get it.
[P1820] You know, if America's running a secret UFO program, yeah, the Russians will want to know.
[P1821] So very shortly thereafter, I realized the true focus of AATIP.
[P1822] And it was to look at and realize at that point the U.S.
[P1823] government was taking very, very seriously
[P1824] encounters of UAP over controlled military airspace and over our sensitive facilities.
[P1825] And the more we looked into it, the more we realized not only was it real, but it's a real national security issue.
[P1826] Like we got real stuff happening where these, I've got another document here.
[P1827] These things actually interfered with our ability for a nuclear strike hit.
[P1828] I mean, think about that, right?
[P1829] Restrict our ability to launch if we're attacked by the Russians.
[P1830] The UAP was able to turn off an entire flight of nukes.
[P1831] Now, what's a flight of nukes?
[P1832] Think of a Christmas tree light, where each light is a military, is a nuclear silo, and you've got this kind of central command post.
[P1833] Well, they were all taken offline.
[P1834] by a UAP.
[P1835] And by the way, one of the intelligence reports I have, and I can read it to you, it's not conjecture.
[P1836] It's like, oh, well, maybe.
[P1837] No, they saw the UAP, and all of a sudden, boom, the entire flight goes down.
[P1838] And only when the UFO left did the nukes come back online.
[P1839] And if that's not scary enough, we had intelligence reports that the same thing happened in Russia, but there, they were turned onto a ready position.
[P1840] Like where ours were turned off, theirs were turned on.
[P1841] Wow.
[P1842] Yeah, so we had serious concerns.
[P1843] And while ASAP was looking at other stuff as well regarding the ranch, my focus was really the national security issue of, look, it's very simple.
[P1844] We have a capability, a technology that's been demonstrated that can enter our airspace completely unchallenged.
[P1845] of unknown origin and who seems to be interested in our military equities, our military capabilities, and, oh, by the way, has demonstrated an ability to interfere with our nuclear technologies.
[P1846] Now, if that's not a national security issue or a Department of Defense mission or an intelligence mission is, then I don't know what is, right?
[P1847] That's the very definition of a national security threat.
[P1848] So that was what
[P1849] That was the impetus, I think, for a lot of my colleagues in mind.
[P1850] And now, you know, being the new kid on the block, I'm kind of walking around like, oh, my gosh, wow, wow, that's real?
[P1851] Wait a minute, Roswell's real?
[P1852] You know, and my scientists that have been, you know, there forever and part of other efforts with the U.S.
[P1853] government kind of putting their hand on my shoulder, be like, yeah, you're going to learn a lot here, buddy.
[P1854] Buckle up, it's going to be a wild ride.
[P1855] And boy, were they right.
[P1856] I worked with some of America's finest in that capacity.
[P1857] Really, really good people.
[P1858] And then in 2017, on October 4th, I resigned from my beloved department.
[P1859] Why did you resign?
[P1860] So... Boy, I have to backtrack here.
[P1861] Yeah.
[P1862] There was an aerospace defense contractor that had agreed to surrender their crash retrieval material to us because we were the government, we're running the program.
[P1863] We had a facility specially built at a SAPF level, SAPF facility level.
[P1864] And so,
[P1865] They said, here's a catch.
[P1866] You just need, because we have this existing memorandum from the Secretary of the Air Force saying we can't, we have to, we have to possess this stuff.
[P1867] If you can get another memo from the Secretary of the Air Force saying we can give it to you, we'll give it to you.
[P1868] Because we, this is a lie.
[P1869] At this point, we're keeping the lights on.
[P1870] It's very expensive.
[P1871] We don't want to deal with this anymore.
[P1872] You can have the material.
[P1873] We've exploited what we can exploit from it.
[P1874] The problem is Secretary of the Air Force didn't want to play ball.
[P1875] So along comes Mattis, and thank God Trump gets there, brings Mattis in.
[P1876] I'm like, man, my old friend's back.
[P1877] If we can't get a memorandum of approval from the Secretary of the Air Force, I'll just go above him, and I'll just go straight to SecDef.
[P1878] I'll just go to Daddy Mattis and say, hey, Jim, I need some help.
[P1879] But you know, too, how command and control works, and we understand chain of command.
[P1880] So I was always very careful never to just intercept the boss and be like, hey, boss, I need to talk to you.
[P1881] Because I had many levels above me that I would have to go through.
[P1882] The problem is one of my direct supervisors at the time, I knew this, but nobody else did, had several IG investigations against him.
[P1883] So I couldn't trust him.
[P1884] And so what I did is I went around him and I was briefing with the concurrence of the secretary's front office.
[P1885] I was briefing the secretary's staff, the White House advisor, National Security Council advisor, and another advisor who I'm not allowed to say who they worked for.
[P1886] Well, say they worked for the CIA.
[P1887] I can't say who they were.
[P1888] There were the three...
[P1889] head people for the secretary.
[P1890] They're opening the secretary suite.
[P1891] If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about, right there on the E-ring, and on the river entrance.
[P1892] And so I was briefing them on a weekly basis.
[P1893] weekly basis, yeah, this is important, Lou, and I've got the pilots coming, I've got the radar operators coming, I've got the reports, I've got the documents, I've got the photographs, I've got the videos, I've got the briefings, I've got, you know, a stack of crap this big every time coming in, and they're like, yeah, this is important.
[P1894] The problem is, we can't brief the Secretary of Defense just yet.
[P1895] I'm like, well, you can't wait.
[P1896] He has to know, because if something happens, we're already getting, we have these ships, the Roosevelt, that's being literally stocked by UAP on a daily basis.
[P1897] I mean, I have these emails on Cipronet saying, hey, Lou, I can't keep people below deck forever.
[P1898] What do you want me to do?
[P1899] They're all over the ship, right?
[P1900] So I'm like, okay, don't worry.
[P1901] The cavalry is coming.
[P1902] We're working this.
[P1903] We're going to get you the relief you're looking for.
[P1904] I got you.
[P1905] The problem is that people in the headshed
[P1906] didn't want to do anything until the boss, until we had a, at the time, our Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, the USDI, the head senior principal staff assistant for the secretary for all things intelligence, wasn't a Senate-confirmed person.
[P1907] So they wanted to wait and wait and wait until they got somebody in there, Senate-confirmed, brief the USDI, who then we would brief Secretary Mattis.
[P1908] I kept telling him, guys, don't let bureaucracy get in your way.
[P1909] Don't do it.
[P1910] We cannot afford the wait.
[P1911] He needs to know now that what's happening in the field
[P1912] I can't keep a lid on it anymore.
[P1913] Everybody's going to know this.
[P1914] And I also think there may have been some, and to protect the boss, which I totally get, nobody wants to be the one to tell the boss, hey, look, we got a problem, boss.
[P1915] There's something in our skies.
[P1916] We don't know what it is.
[P1917] We don't know how it works.
[P1918] We don't know where it's from.
[P1919] We don't know who's buying the wheel.
[P1920] And oh, by the way, it's interested in our stuff.
[P1921] It's not a great conversation to have with somebody, especially like Mad Dog Mattis, or others call him chaos.
[P1922] He wants answers.
[P1923] And if you ever worked with a guy in the field, you know General Mattis is a very serious guy, very learned.
[P1924] He's a guy who wants more information, not less.
[P1925] And then last but not least, I suspect what they didn't want to do is give the boss some information only to be asked a week later by the media
[P1926] Have you ever been briefed on UFOs?
[P1927] And he would have to say for the record, yeah, I've been briefed on UFOs, right?
[P1928] So there's many reasons for it.
[P1929] And looking back, I can understand it.
[P1930] But at the time, I was very frustrated.
[P1931] And so I knew that the only way I'd be able to get the Secretary's attention without breaking that chain of command, I could have walked in any time I wanted to into his front office, and I have.
[P1932] But you and I both know you don't break the chain of command
[P1933] You can't break the rules to enforce the rules.
[P1934] You can't do it.
[P1935] It doesn't work that way.
[P1936] You can't break the law to enforce the law.
[P1937] And so I was very cognizant of that.
[P1938] So I did what most people do in my situation.
[P1939] I resigned.
[P1940] And I knew that my resignation, addressed my resignation memo directly to him, knowing that they would not be able to stop that.
[P1941] And they tried, by the way, even that they tried.
[P1942] Um...
[P1943] But I told him very point blank in my resignation.
[P1944] I said, sir, you need to be aware this is real.
[P1945] And this has the ability to impact our nuclear capabilities, our military readiness.
[P1946] And it's a problem you're going to have to deal with.
[P1947] Had you been in touch with him since then?
[P1948] I have not.
[P1949] No, I think he lives overseas right now with his lady.
[P1950] But there's some back-channel discussions that occurred.
[P1951] It's for him to say, not me.
[P1952] I respect him tremendously.
[P1953] He was a great leader in the military.
[P1954] Politically, I don't know.
[P1955] I'm not talking politics, right?
[P1956] I'm not a politician.
[P1957] But he was a very effective leader.
[P1958] And let's not forget, look, almost a year later today, he resigned too, right?
[P1959] That's what you do.
[P1960] When you can't fix something internally, you don't become a problem inside.
[P1961] you leave you do what you're supposed to do and say okay aye aye sir and you roll out and then if you want to want to speak your piece outside fine but don't cause problems inside the chain of command that's that that is unforgivable and i agree with that you know um i know some people differ with me on that perspective but it's the way i feel it's a little
[P1962] We keep talking about UFOs and UAPs interfering with our nuclear arsenal.
[P1963] What are we doing to combat that?
[P1964] Well, I think this new administration is going to do a lot.
[P1965] Like what?
[P1966] Well, let me let the administration first get a handle on what's going on and decide what they want to do.
[P1967] A nuclear facility isn't just...
[P1968] Department of Defense, not just Air Force.
[P1969] You have Department of Energy there.
[P1970] You have all sorts of different organizations there that are part of the calculus, right?
[P1971] So you've got a lot of equities.
[P1972] First of all, they need to get a handle on what's going on.
[P1973] And by the way, for the record, I am extremely optimistic about this administration.
[P1974] I think this is the best thing that could have happened to this country.
[P1975] I get a lot of shit for it.
[P1976] But...
[P1977] This is something I know several individuals on the cabinet, I'm not going to say who, that are very interested in transparency for the American people, like sincerely, really want transparency, while also understanding we have to protect national secrets, right?
[P1978] So I think there is going to be some things done that will prevent...
[P1979] any type of, hopefully, any type of interference in the future of our nuclear equities.
[P1980] Now, that's not to say, I mean, if something is super highly advanced and they're using a capability we don't understand, then how do you defend against that, right?
[P1981] Well, I mean, you know, now they have this, you know, I interviewed Joe Lonsdale, Epirus, the directed EMP weapon that can take out 100 drones plus at once.
[P1982] I mean, is that something we could implement?
[P1983] Yeah, and we already should have implemented it.
[P1984] This last administration dragged their feet.
[P1985] No, we can't do anything about it.
[P1986] Hell, you can.
[P1987] Yes, you can, and you should.
[P1988] This is my frustration.
[P1989] When we allow politics to drive national-level decisions involving security without having the expertise in-house or resident, then everything becomes a political calculus.
[P1990] And that's fine until you talk about national security.
[P1991] there has to be an emphasis on national security especially with our nuclear equities i mean what do you make of this it was that that that video the whistleblower the saw i think it was an air force special operations guy that came out recently the whistleblower that came out about the the egg-shaped craft that we picked up there's a little video on night vision we're going to overlay it right now on the video but i mean
[P1992] What do you make of this?
[P1993] He says it's an alien craft ritual.
[P1994] Well, first of all, any time a veteran comes out, I always give them deference.
[P1995] Why?
[P1996] Because they earned it.
[P1997] I don't care if they're wrong or not.
[P1998] They earned that privilege to speak their mind.
[P1999] Secondly, he is who he says he is.
[P2000] He is a former special operator.
[P2001] That is fact.
[P2002] So whether you are a Navy SEAL or you're an Air Force PJ or you're an Army special operator...
[P2003] You know, these are folks that are not just trained observers, as you know, but they're highly skilled, right?
[P2004] And you go through a battery of psychological evaluations and sometimes polygraphs and drug testing.
[P2005] And, you know, these are really representing the best of the best tip of the spear.
[P2006] And that's why they're the tip of the spear.
[P2007] Where was that retrieved?
[P2008] You know what?
[P2009] I'm going to let him, I don't want to talk too much about his story because it's really up to him.
[P2010] You asked me about him as a person.
[P2011] I believe he is speaking his truth.
[P2012] I believe he is doing what he believes is correct.
[P2013] And for that, I support him.
[P2014] I was not there for that recovery.
[P2015] I was not there when he decided to come out.
[P2016] Had you seen anything like that before?
[P2017] There's reports of a vehicle shaped exactly like... Lonnie Zamora.
[P2018] I mean...
[P2019] Read the case.
[P2020] He was a cop.
[P2021] And he talked about an egg-shaped crap.
[P2022] Just like that, back in the 60s, right?
[P2023] So, you know, the morphology of this is not anything new.
[P2024] The question is, is that what it was?
[P2025] Or was it, you know, something else?
[P2026] I don't know.
[P2027] But the fact that he's willing to come out publicly and tell this conversation, I think is important.
[P2028] And I hope that other people do too.
[P2029] And people come out and start poo-pooing him.
[P2030] Well, you wonder why more whistleblowers don't come out.
[P2031] Look at the way I was treated.
[P2032] I'm not boo-booing him.
[P2033] I'm just asking.
[P2034] No, no, no, no.
[P2035] I don't mean you.
[P2036] I mean that rhetorically.
[P2037] People in general will say, well, how come we don't have more whistleblowers?
[P2038] Well, look when the whistleblowers come out, how they're treated.
[P2039] Look at poor Dave Grouch.
[P2040] Here's a guy who I served with.
[P2041] We were at Space Force together working the UFO topic.
[P2042] Working for the UAP task force.
[P2043] That's what we were doing.
[P2044] That was our job.
[P2045] He comes out 24 hours after testifying in Congress.
[P2046] What happens?
[P2047] Two guys from the CIA apparently leak his medical information and try to use his PTSD against him.
[P2048] You know what?
[P2049] F you.
[P2050] Low life, piece of crap person that would use somebody's combat PTSD against him.
[P2051] That is, you know, you who never done nothing, never popped nothing, never served nobody.
[P2052] You don't deserve it.
[P2053] Get your ass in the corner because that guy was a hero.
[P2054] He actually did the right thing.
[P2055] I saw him every day.
[P2056] And by the way, everything he said was absolutely, everything he told Congress was correct.
[P2057] Mm-hmm.
[P2058] And a lot more he knows that he hasn't said.
[P2059] And so what's his reward for speaking his truth?
[P2060] What happened?
[P2061] Oh, this guy, alcoholic.
[P2062] Oh, this guy, PTSD.
[P2063] I mean, that is the reaction by certain elements within a corrupt system.
[P2064] And by the way, that's my real issue.
[P2065] That's what motivates me every single day to come out.
[P2066] It's not just the UAP topic.
[P2067] We've got a very significant issue on our hands right now.
[P2068] And it's been there for a while.
[P2069] It's become a cancer in our government.
[P2070] And that concerns me because that threatens everything.
[P2071] That threatens everybody.
[P2072] And, you know, unless you ask me, I won't go down that road, but...
[P2073] But that, to me, is a much greater national security issue than UAPs ever were.
[P2074] What do you think he's hoping by coming out with this?
[P2075] Do you think he's trying to force the government to reveal something?
[P2076] Yeah, he's trying to do what I did and other colleagues of mine.
[P2077] Let America know the truth without getting in trouble and without being thrown into jail and wearing an orange jumpsuit.
[P2078] You know, the problem is that there's a very sophisticated capability to try to smear people like that.
[P2079] Wait till the real truth starts to hit.
[P2080] People are going to go crazy.
[P2081] When people find out the length that some individuals in this system were willing to go to to keep us quiet, you wait till that shoe drops.
[P2082] That's coming out.
[P2083] You think it's going to come out?
[P2084] Oh, I know it's coming out.
[P2085] Absolutely.
[P2086] Yes, sir.
[P2087] Is there any relationship between that and, I mean, did you watch my interview with Sam Shoemate, the Matthews-Livelsburger?
[P2088] You have to forgive me, Chris.
[P2089] It's okay.
[P2090] Do you know about Matthews-Livelsburger is the Cybertruck guy?
[P2091] He's a former Green Beret.
[P2092] Yes.
[P2093] Blew up the Cybertruck Hotel.
[P2094] I know the story very well.
[P2095] Okay.
[P2096] I know what you did.
[P2097] I didn't see the interview.
[P2098] I apologize.
[P2099] It's fine.
[P2100] But I know very well that scenario and the email you received and the information you received.
[P2101] In the email, he talks about gravitic propulsion systems.
[P2102] Is there any relationship between that and what the soft veteran just revealed in the short night vision video?
[P2103] There is a relationship to the story.
[P2104] if it turns out that that video is authentic and legitimate then the answer is an absolute yes but first that video again i wasn't there to shoot the video so i want to be very careful what i say um but anti-gravitics has always been the holy grail for us and there's several reasons for it but if you can understand and somehow control and master anti-gravitics
[P2105] then that is going, whoever figures that out is going to put you about 200 years ahead of everybody else.
[P2106] And that's big.
[P2107] That's big.
[P2108] We kind of talked about this at the beginning.
[P2109] Yeah.
[P2110] Yeah.
[P2111] You know, antigravitics is the holy grail.
[P2112] All sorts of things.
[P2113] It's not just being able to fly without any obvious signs of propulsion or without wings and control surfaces.
[P2114] Again, space-time.
[P2115] If you understand anti-gravity and the warping of space-time, then distance doesn't mean so much to you.
[P2116] Time is a little more flexible.
[P2117] And so there's a reason why the U.S.
[P2118] government doesn't even like to talk about it or any other government.
[P2119] Yeah, we looked into it.
[P2120] It's just a science fiction term.
[P2121] Is it?
[P2122] It's all we could find.
[P2123] Couldn't find anything.
[P2124] You know, it's an interesting world we live in.
[P2125] I mean, it sounds like you know about this.
[P2126] Do you know about this?
[P2127] You know, when it comes to certain capabilities, I'm not going to go there.
[P2128] You know, people just have to see.
[P2129] I don't want to be, look, I'm trying to do this in a constructive way, not a destructive way.
[P2130] I'm extremely loyal.
[P2131] People think I left the department out of disloyalty.
[P2132] No, I left the department out of loyalty.
[P2133] I want to do the right thing without, I want to have the conversation without being destructive.
[P2134] And the reason why I left the Pentagon was really just to finish the mission they gave me in the first place.
[P2135] What about the New Jersey drones?
[P2136] Yeah.
[P2137] You know, that came out, what, about a month ago?
[P2138] It wasn't just New Jersey.
[P2139] It was New York, Massachusetts, Florida, California, Oregon, Washington.
[P2140] Even in the U.K.
[P2141] I think it kind of spun out of control.
[P2142] I mean, every asshole with a drone was throwing it up and taking videos of it.
[P2143] Sure, and I'm not worried about those.
[P2144] My concern is when you have some that have been reported the size of an SUV, or more importantly, aren't blinking.
[P2145] First of all, they're not squawking.
[P2146] There's no transponder on them.
[P2147] which is a large enough commercial drone they're supposed to.
[P2148] Then secondly, the light patterns were not consistent with, in some cases, not with navigational aviation lights.
[P2149] And then third, they were silent.
[P2150] And fourth, when we actually deployed drones to try to intercept, individuals tried to do that, there seemed to be an anti-drone capability on board, meaning some drones were disabled and fell out of the sky, the ones that were flown to try to intercept these other drones.
[P2151] Now, let's talk about drones for a second in New Jersey.
[P2152] Most people are familiar with the quadcopters.
[P2153] Commercially available hobbyists have little quadcopters.
[P2154] They fly for about 15 minutes, maybe a mile or two, and then they have to be recovered.
[P2155] Now, imagine what it takes to fly a drone that's the size of an SUV.
[P2156] Let's look at it technologically just for a second.
[P2157] Most drones are line of sight, RF, right?
[P2158] Radio frequency, line of sight.
[P2159] Fly the drone, it sees me, I see it, and it's getting my signal, I can control it.
[P2160] If you want to go beyond the horizon,
[P2161] beyond line of sight, right?
[P2162] You now need infrastructure to do that.
[P2163] You need a repeating capability, meaning an airborne capability or a land-based capability that will take that signal and then retransmit it out to your drone because you're now over the horizon where these signals are going to reach.
[P2164] So you need an artificial way, whether it's a balloon or a satellite or a tower,
[P2165] to relay that signal.
[P2166] Otherwise, the thing doesn't fly.
[P2167] It'll crash.
[P2168] So you've got to transmit that.
[P2169] That takes infrastructure.
[P2170] Then if you're going to have a drone that flies more than 15 minutes, in some cases, five, six, seven hours, and not fly two miles, but fly over 100 miles,
[P2171] Think about that.
[P2172] There's only two types of fuel we use for drones.
[P2173] One is internal combustion engine, like, you know, jetty fuel maybe you use, or gasoline for propeller, internal combustion engine, or battery.
[P2174] Now, batteries don't last that long, and they're heavy as hell.
[P2175] And the fuel is even more expensive.
[P2176] If you want liquid fuel, that's even heavier.
[P2177] So loiter capability, the reason why our drones now, like a Reaper or something like that, are fixed wing, because they've got to stay flying for a long time.
[P2178] And so...
[P2179] A helicopter, a rotary blade drone can't do that.
[P2180] You don't have that loiter capability, so you have a fixed-wing capability.
[P2181] That's not what these were.
[P2182] They weren't fixed-wing capabilities.
[P2183] And so if you want to fly a drone, even one of those, you have to have someone to launch it, someone to control it, someone to recover it, someone to maintain it, someone to refuel it or re-energize it, right?
[P2184] So now you're talking a group of individuals that have to be on flying just a single drone drone.
[P2185] with that type of capability.
[P2186] Where are you going to launch it from without being seen or detected?
[P2187] Where are you going to recover it from without not a single one being recovered, right?
[P2188] Completely in the dark.
[P2189] Now you're talking about, okay, well, maybe I can launch it from a boat.
[P2190] Okay, well, how far out are you going to be in international waters?
[P2191] And are you sure the Coast Guard's not going to see you and your ship identifier and all these other things?
[P2192] I mean, as some people reported having a quote-unquote mothership, that's a big profile in the water.
[P2193] Okay, well, maybe they're launching them for submarines.
[P2194] Okay, great.
[P2195] But then there's another challenge with that, too.
[P2196] Is the submarine surfacing to launch them?
[P2197] Or are these things being launched subsurface?
[P2198] Meaning like the old Polaris missile, right?
[P2199] It blows out of a tube and flies.
[P2200] Now, what about when it lands?
[P2201] And what about if one crashes?
[P2202] Because, you know, it's technology, right?
[P2203] It could be interfered with electronic jamming capabilities.
[P2204] You know, are you willing to take that risk and all of a sudden now you've lost a drone and it's paraded like the Russians did with the U-2 back in the 1960s when we were flying the U-2 over Mother Russia?
[P2205] No, that's a PR disaster.
[P2206] So there's a lot of things that are inconsistent.
[P2207] with some of the descriptions of some of these UAP or some of these UASs or drones.
[P2208] And I think, you know, the fact that we don't know is proof positive why we need to know.
[P2209] For the government to come out, this last administration, I mean, this is embarrassing to say to the American people, yeah, you all are seeing stuff.
[P2210] Every single one of these are being flown in a legal way.
[P2211] and they're all either high-risk drones or manned aircraft.
[P2212] First of all, you don't shut down a military air base because something's being flown over your base legally.
[P2213] Get the hell out of town.
[P2214] We're not that stupid, right?
[P2215] And when you have all these people that are reporting, to include members of Congress,
[P2216] Don't tell me that these are all legitimately because if they were, then where's the paperwork from the FAA?
[P2217] Where's the squat code on this?
[P2218] How come they're not showing up on FlightAware?
[P2219] Right?
[P2220] Nothing.
[P2221] And then they'll say, oh, these are all being flown legally, but we don't know whose they are.
[P2222] Wait a minute.
[P2223] Then how can you say they're being flown legally if you don't know whose they belong to?
[P2224] Right?
[P2225] Even the statement itself is contradictory.
[P2226] And saying, no, no, folks, just don't worry about it.
[P2227] Nothing to see here.
[P2228] Right?
[P2229] You know, that's the same kind of crap they tried to pull with other things, like with the Afghanistan withdrawal.
[P2230] Don't get me started.
[P2231] I mean, you keep feeding a bunch of line of people, a bunch of crap to people.
[P2232] You think that they're going to get used to eating crap?
[P2233] No.
[P2234] They're going to get pissed off and throw the plate in your face.
[P2235] And that's what we saw with this last election.
[P2236] The people got tired of being lied to and constantly being told something that was exact opposite of what was happening.
[P2237] Politics aside, I don't care if you're Democrat or Republican, nobody needs to do that.
[P2238] Just tell the American the truth.
[P2239] And look, if you don't have an answer, say that too.
[P2240] But don't lie, don't insult the American public.
[P2241] You know, come on, that's not why we put people in office.
[P2242] I mean, what are they?
[P2243] What are they?
[P2244] What do you think they are?
[P2245] Well, I think there might be multiple things.
[P2246] It might be a combination of things.
[P2247] You might have, so in the old days, if you had like, for example,
[P2248] If you breach the perimeter of a military base, you would have some Jeeps come out and maybe a helicopter to try to find what's going on.
[P2249] But we're more sophisticated than that.
[P2250] We now have drone capability ourselves.
[P2251] And so if we detect something on the perimeter, break in a perimeter, we can just launch drones like that automatically.
[P2252] We can geofence the whole place and automatically have drones take off without even a human being involved to figure out what's going on.
[P2253] And by the way, it's a lot cheaper.
[P2254] You can cover a lot more area using a drone than you can with one or two helicopters.
[P2255] So...
[P2256] Imagine a scenario where maybe some people are reporting some sort of really anomalous issue, a UAP perhaps.
[P2257] And then the response by us is to launch drones to try to figure out what's going on.
[P2258] And so you have some people reporting something that doesn't look like a drone, size of an SUV that disappears, comes in and out of the water potentially, stalks Coast Guard boats in the middle of the ocean, right, up to 20 at a time.
[P2259] And then our response is to launch drones to figure out what these are.
[P2260] And then people report, no, I was whirring.
[P2261] I could hear making sound.
[P2262] It was blinking lights like a plane.
[P2263] It was definitely a drone.
[P2264] They both could be right.
[P2265] Both could actually be happening.
[P2266] Now, I'm not saying, for the record, I'm not saying that's what's occurring, but that could explain why you have this varying degrees of explanation between eyewitnesses.
[P2267] Someone says it's huge, it's been loiting for hours and hours, it doesn't look like anything I've ever seen before, and then someone says, oh, no, it's a little tiny thing with warring blades and blinky lights.
[P2268] So to ask your question, what is it and is it one or the other?
[P2269] It actually could be both.
[P2270] And it could also be other options that we haven't yet considered.
[P2271] But again, this is why it's so important.
[P2272] This is why I've been trying to emphasize with the new administration to get a handle on this because this will be a PR disaster.
[P2273] It will be if it already has been if we don't get a handle on it.
[P2274] So there's been several recommendations that have been floated up to the new administration to help President Trump get a handle on this and do exactly like he said he's going to do.
[P2275] And I have full faith in confidence.
[P2276] What are some of the other possibilities that we haven't considered?
[P2277] Foreign adversarial capability.
[P2278] It's not a blue force technology.
[P2279] It's a red force technology that's being used to assess our reaction to certain things.
[P2280] I mean, I think that was brought up.
[P2281] There was a lot of chatter that it might be Iranian drones.
[P2282] I mean, there have been reports that that's why the inauguration was moved indoors.
[P2283] It was an Iranian drone threat.
[P2284] Yeah.
[P2285] Could be Chinese.
[P2286] Then there's also the other alternative which you discussed.
[P2287] Maybe it's a blue force response to a threat and we don't want to panic the public.
[P2288] You know, we've got a broken arrow situation on our hands.
[P2289] We've got a lost nuke
[P2290] Or maybe some bad guy figured out how to do something and put something together under our noses.
[P2291] That's a scary thought.
[P2292] Or it could be someone trying to figure out, look, let's see the response.
[P2293] If I was a bad guy and I wanted to use a drone to spray some sort of chemical or biological agent, right?
[P2294] How do we defend against that?
[P2295] Could we detect it, you know, an airborne aerosol attack?
[P2296] And so how do we detect it?
[P2297] Well, we'll send some drones out to spray something, nothing bad, just something, a tracer that we can pick up with other drones and send other drones out to say, yeah, we can actually pick this up and this technology works, right?
[P2298] So there's lots of different possibilities, and we really need to consider them all.
[P2299] I don't understand why we wouldn't have used one of those directed EMP weapons.
[P2300] Brethren, we could have and we should have and we didn't.
[P2301] This is my point.
[P2302] It is so ridiculous.
[P2303] And all it takes is someone in the administration say, you know, FAA... Look, I will tell you, when I was in the Pentagon, I was part of a working group, the U.S.
[P2304] Aerodomain Working Group, and it was co-sponsored by the FAA and Department of Homeland Security, DHS.
[P2305] And even when I was there, like, 2013 and 2014, they were still arguing who was responsible for what.
[P2306] When you say, okay, who's responsible for drones...
[P2307] No one wanted to accept it.
[P2308] It's ridiculous.
[P2309] And this is why I think the president, you're going to see probably some maybe executive orders come out saying from now on, okay, you're going to do this.
[P2310] And if there's a drone in the sky, the buck stops with you.
[P2311] And yes, you can shoot it down.
[P2312] If it's not ours and we're not squawking, then shame on you.
[P2313] Zap it.
[P2314] If it turns out to be a government contractor, well, you should have listed your flight path.
[P2315] Sorry.
[P2316] Sorry your million-dollar capability crashed.
[P2317] That was your fault, not mine.
[P2318] So, yes, we do have the capability.
[P2319] Very easy to do that, but we don't.
[P2320] Yeah, yeah.
[P2321] Just like the Chinese spy balloon, right?
[P2322] How many went over the northern continental United States before we actually saw one and shot it down?
[P2323] Oh, I was really upset about that.
[P2324] It did turn out that we did extract some type of intelligence out of that balloon.
[P2325] Well, you know, the story is now, right, that we've been knowing about these flights for a long time.
[P2326] Yeah.
[P2327] And it never got reported up.
[P2328] So that's a break in the chain of command, too.
[P2329] And who had the unilateral authority to make that decision?
[P2330] Yeah.
[P2331] I guarantee you they did not have that authority.
[P2332] Yeah.
[P2333] Yeah.
[P2334] How close are... I mean, what is...
[P2335] How concerned are you that China, Russia, Iran, name, enemy of us, has this type of technology?
[P2336] This type?
[P2337] As in the drone technology or the UAP technology?
[P2338] The UAP.
[P2339] Oh.
[P2340] Sean, I am worried.
[P2341] I'm worried particularly with the two big guys, Russia and China.
[P2342] China has already announced through the Five Continents Initiative...
[P2343] to be in charge of the entire United Nations effort for UAP investigations.
[P2344] They announced what?
[P2345] Can you say that again?
[P2346] I think it was the South China Morning Sun.
[P2347] They announced, through what they call the Five Continents Initiative, China has proposed to the United Nations that they set up and run the UAP investigation for the United Nations.
[P2348] Russia has had a long history in this.
[P2349] In fact, right after the Berlin Wall fell down, and there was this brief romance period, this marriage kind of honeymoon between the United States and Russia.
[P2350] Remember when that happened?
[P2351] The ball came down.
[P2352] Actually, you might have been too young.
[P2353] There was this brief period for a few years where we were working with KGB.
[P2354] KGB was working with us, and they were giving us all their files.
[P2355] And we gained a lot of insight into their UAP program, into the UAP program.
[P2356] Better not say it.
[P2357] There's some names, program names that the Russians were involved with involving UAP.
[P2358] And it was very precise.
[P2359] They were sharing a lot of intel with us.
[P2360] There was a lot of it.
[P2361] And even at AATIP, we had a lot of that intel available to us.
[P2362] So we know for a fact Russia and China.
[P2363] We also know for a fact that there were several key allies, Five-Eye partners.
[P2364] I won't say which ones they are because they might get mad.
[P2365] but they were interested, and we had actually an information sharing agreement with them.
[P2366] In fact, Japan, two and a half years ago, came to the United States, two and a half years ago, came to, actually about three years ago now, came to the Pentagon and asked to enter into a bilateral intelligence information sharing agreement with the United States for the sole purposes of sharing UAP-related information.
[P2367] Interesting.
[P2368] Is there any overlap with this information and intel?
[P2369] When you say overlap, I'm trying to define... What I'm asking, are we seeing any similarities?
[P2370] Oh, yeah, all similarities.
[P2371] That's what ATIP did.
[P2372] That's what the five observables were.
[P2373] Yeah, there's similarities.
[P2374] So they don't have totally different shit than we have.
[P2375] No, well... It's a little bit different.
[P2376] When you say they don't have different, are you talking about other nations?
[P2377] I'm sorry.
[P2378] Forgive me.
[P2379] When we're sharing files with Russia or Japan or China or whoever the hell it is, are we seeing similarities in the intelligence?
[P2380] Absolutely.
[P2381] Yes.
[P2382] The morphology, the velocity, the performance characteristics, the capabilities.
[P2383] Absolutely we are.
[P2384] Okay.
[P2385] Absolutely we are.
[P2386] What the Italian fighter pilot saw three weeks ago over the Adriatic Sea, we saw four years ago with a Navy Super Hornet pilot.
[P2387] Absolutely.
[P2388] Okay.
[P2389] Okay.
[P2390] How much do you think they know that we don't know?
[P2391] That's my fear.
[P2392] That's why this is a problem.
[P2393] I don't fear the UAP or the UAP technology.
[P2394] I fear some other country having that technology and using it against us.
[P2395] And here we are, we're not even willing to have the conversation with our own people.
[P2396] And they're totally open about it.
[P2397] They don't give shit.
[P2398] They're spending lots of money into this topic.
[P2399] So that is part of my concern.
[P2400] Well, I hope you're right.
[P2401] I hope we start getting some answers.
[P2402] Well, the good news is I think we actually know a lot more than we've admitted, fortunately.
[P2403] Is that good news?
[P2404] I guess it probably is.
[P2405] Well, what it is, it's...
[P2406] It's at least, I think, encouraging that we've been looking at UFOs for a long time, brother.
[P2407] This is not new.
[P2408] We have been involved in this topic since well before Blue Book.
[P2409] I just read you a document.
[P2410] They're from 1950.
[P2411] There's stuff from the National Security Council, the president, from J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the CIA.
[P2412] It's all in writing.
[P2413] It's all there.
[P2414] I just sent you a small little, tiny little snapshot of some of the reporting.
[P2415] There's a bunch of it.
[P2416] So people say, well, you know, our government doesn't know anything.
[P2417] Hello?
[P2418] Yes, they do.
[P2419] That's just been a recent part of the narrative, so you don't look over there.
[P2420] We've known about it for a long time.
[P2421] We've been investigating.
[P2422] There's documents on official investigations all the way to the White House on this topic.
[P2423] We got it.
[P2424] So I would tell people, I think, look, here's the good news, because I don't want to be all doom and gloom and people say, oh, you're fear-mongering and, you know, you're trying to say things are a threat.
[P2425] No, I'm not.
[P2426] The threat is our lack of knowledge on this topic, and our threat is not being transparent with the American people.
[P2427] You can't fix a problem, right?
[P2428] You can't recover from a problem if you don't identify it in the first place.
[P2429] Right?
[P2430] I think we're at the point now, there was a fear for a very long time why our government didn't share this information with the American public.
[P2431] And I understand.
[P2432] I don't agree with it, for the record, but I can respect it and understand it.
[P2433] At the height of the Cold War, what was going on?
[P2434] Well, you had this...
[P2435] winner-takes-all approach to a chess match between then-Soviet Union and the United States.
[P2436] And we had a lot of things going on.
[P2437] We had civil unrest, and we had conflicts over here in Vietnam and other places, and you had a nuke, real nuke issue.
[P2438] Russians had nukes, we had nukes, and we're building more and more and more and more and possibly go to war.
[P2439] And there was this concern that
[P2440] you know, here's this real threat from Russia and then you've got this other thing going on here that is interesting but doesn't show any obvious signs of being a threat yet.
[P2441] So why don't we focus on this issue here and then we'll kind of maybe at some point address that issue.
[P2442] Then there's also the notion of you don't admit there's a problem until you have a solution.
[P2443] Look, governments are solution-oriented.
[P2444] That's what we pay them to do, to have solutions.
[P2445] And let me give you a real case point of this.
[P2446] In the 1960s, it was actually started in the 50s, the CIA and Lockheed at the time developed the U-2 spy plane.
[P2447] And the idea of this plane was to fly faster and higher than any other plane we ever had and fly in contravention to what?
[P2448] The Russian agreement we had, the treaty with the Russians that we would not fly manned reconnaissance missions over mainland Russia.
[P2449] And what did we do?
[P2450] We did the exact opposite.
[P2451] We actually flew manned reconnaissance missions, but we did it in a way where we didn't think they would ever see it.
[P2452] And what happened the first couple missions?
[P2453] We succeeded.
[P2454] Russians didn't respond.
[P2455] Mission success.
[P2456] They didn't even know we were there.
[P2457] Or did they?
[P2458] It wasn't until the Russians were able to develop and deploy the SA-2 surface-to-air missile and successfully shoot one down and parade Powers, who was the pilot, and show the wreckage in front of the United Nations, did the Russians ever admit that they were tracking every single flight.
[P2459] It wasn't until they could neutralize the threat did they ever admit, even to the Russian people, that there was a problem.
[P2460] Because that's what governments do.
[P2461] And so is it possible that some people in our government said, look, this is just too much for most people to absorb right now.
[P2462] We don't know how to deal with it.
[P2463] Let's not cause panic.
[P2464] There were some studies that were done by the United States government commissioned to some think tanks by the U.S.
[P2465] government.
[P2466] And in those studies, they said, what would happen with the American people if we disclosed
[P2467] the presence of UFOs?
[P2468] And the answer was, you can't.
[P2469] You will cause civil unrest throughout our population.
[P2470] And people say, no, that's silly.
[P2471] You're not going to cause panic and civil unrest.
[P2472] Well, look, it's happened before where people got freaked out.
[P2473] When the Dead Sea Scrolls were, I think it was 1947, right?
[P2474] They were discovered, the Dead Sea Scrolls.
[P2475] It was like...
[P2476] years and years and years later before the translation of those Dead Sea Scrolls were publicly released.
[P2477] Now, why is that?
[P2478] Because they were afraid it was going to contradict the current understanding of the Judeo-Christian belief system.
[P2479] We don't want, this will upset people too much, right?
[P2480] Cause panic, cause anxiety, hysteria at a mass scale.
[P2481] I can understand that.
[P2482] I can understand that mentality, but the reality is,
[P2483] The American people can handle the truth.
[P2484] In fact, the American people deserve the truth.
[P2485] This generation, new generation of young men and women are different than mine.
[P2486] They are different.
[P2487] They have access to the entire world on their cell phones, in virtually any language, instantly.
[P2488] If I wanted to go learn something in school, I had to go to the school library, grab a...
[P2489] encyclopedia that's probably 20 years old and read a paragraph on something, right?
[P2490] If the page was even there so that some kid didn't rip it out and put it as part of his book report.
[P2491] Now, you've got the entire world history in the palm of your hands.
[P2492] So I think this new generation is much more willing and readily able to accept some of these more profound ideas about
[P2493] humans and our existence and our place in this cosmos, they're not causing panic.
[P2494] Most of the people, young people I talk to, they go, meh, yeah, we know aliens are real.
[P2495] You do?
[P2496] Yeah, why not?
[P2497] Well, okay.
[P2498] I mean, that's different than when I grew up.
[P2499] You know, people thought you were crazy.
[P2500] In fact, the American Psychological Association once considered the study or research or belief in UFOs as being an extreme form of deviance.
[P2501] Think about that.
[P2502] Same with tattoos, by the way, right?
[P2503] So I think our mentality of our society is changing.
[P2504] I think we're not, you know, the old saying, I'm not your father.
[P2505] This is not your father's Oldsmobile.
[P2506] I don't think we're in the same place mentally, psychologically, sociologically, theologically.
[P2507] than we were in my generation.
[P2508] I think with where we are as a society, things have fundamentally changed.
[P2509] You know, the way we deal with new information and new ideas.
[P2510] Let's not forget that in the words of Arthur C. Clarke, right, any sufficient technology, advanced technology, appears like magic.
[P2511] Right?
[P2512] But it's not.
[P2513] It's just technology.
[P2514] I often tell people, you know, a little exercise.
[P2515] I say, if I tell you the word parachute, para being a prefix, Latin prefix meaning above or beside.
[P2516] So if I say parachute, what do you think of?
[P2517] Well, I think of about a device that deploys over my head and helps me get the ground with a thump and not a thud, hopefully, right?
[P2518] And if I say parachute, I mean, paramedic, what do you think?
[P2519] Well, I think of first responders, something positive, people there to save a life, you know.
[P2520] So paramedic parachute.
[P2521] But then when I say paranormal, what happens?
[P2522] You just did it.
[P2523] You did exactly what most people do.
[P2524] They go, hmm, right?
[P2525] The reason why is because we have been conditioned that word paranormal is spooky.
[P2526] It's weird.
[P2527] When in reality, everything in science, everything in science is paranormal until it becomes normal.
[P2528] The cell phones that we use and Wi-Fi signals and the laptop computers and all that at one point would have been considered paranormal.
[P2529] And now it's routine.
[P2530] It's not normal.
[P2531] It's just advanced technology.
[P2532] And so I think with this new generation of young people, they realize that.
[P2533] They understand that a lot of things that we grew up thinking strange and weird are...
[P2534] You know, I was at a time, you probably remember this probably, you're going, well, yeah, you're in the military for this.
[P2535] Do you remember the whole policy of don't ask, don't tell?
[P2536] Right?
[P2537] And people's lives were ruined, and if they suspected you of being homosexual, that you could lose your entire career and be discharged.
[P2538] Well, that's silly.
[P2539] Who gives a crap someone's gay?
[P2540] I mean, right?
[P2541] But that was the mentality back then.
[P2542] And man, people were, you lose your career over that shit.
[P2543] Now we look back and say...
[P2544] Being patriotic has nothing to do with your sexual orientation.
[P2545] Who gives a shit, right?
[P2546] But that was real back then, and it affected a lot of people's lives.
[P2547] This new generation, I think, realizes that.
[P2548] They're like, hey, man, you guys are really kind of stuck in this old paradigm of doing things.
[P2549] maybe you should reconsider and reevaluate.
[P2550] Because at the end of the day, the topic of UFOs and the UAP, UAP aren't going to change.
[P2551] It's here, whatever it is.
[P2552] The only thing that changes the way that we deal with it, the way we look at it, the way we think about it, the way we handle it, right?
[P2553] We can't change that fact that something exists.
[P2554] I can't change the fact that there's a lion or a tiger or
[P2555] you know, a hippopotamus on that side of the wall, what I can do is change the way that I view that.
[P2556] Is it a threat or is it an opportunity?
[P2557] Can it hurt me?
[P2558] Well, yeah, but if it's behind a case, then probably not.
[P2559] And can I learn something from it?
[P2560] And things like that.
[P2561] That's my perspective.
[P2562] You know, I don't have all the answers.
[P2563] I have some answers that hopefully will continue to...
[P2564] be developed and come out in a legal way.
[P2565] I'm not a leaker.
[P2566] I've never disclosed classified information.
[P2567] I still maintain my top secret security clearance with SCI eligibility.
[P2568] I'm not going to jeopardize it.
[P2569] I took an oath to defend this country from all enemies, foreign and domestic, and that's what I'm going to do.
[P2570] And I don't think I need to compromise national security to have this conversation.
[P2571] We've come a long way in the last seven years.
[P2572] And I've said before to people, there's a difference between doing things right and doing things right now.
[P2573] I prefer to do things right.
[P2574] We have one opportunity to do it right.
[P2575] And I think we are making significant headway.
[P2576] If someone like me were to just come out full Monty and say everything I know, you'll know more information, but you'll never get any more because I'll go to jail and that's it.
[P2577] And so I think there's a balance.
[P2578] I think we can continue to have this conversation
[P2579] get the members of Congress engaged, support our new administration in their pursuit, dogged pursuit of the truth, while increasing the aperture of transparency and disclosure in a manner that is constructive, not destructive, in a manner that gives the American people what they deserve, the information they deserve,
[P2580] but without compromising any type of national security equity or capability.
[P2581] We can do it.
[P2582] Yeah, it's harder.
[P2583] Yeah, it's a lot harder.
[P2584] I know.
[P2585] Ask me how I know.
[P2586] But we're succeeding.
[P2587] We're doing it.
[P2588] We're able to do it.
[P2589] We just got to have a little bit of patience and a little bit of courage.
[P2590] And I think we're doing it.
[P2591] Look, the fact you and I are having this conversation, you are one of the biggest...
[P2592] media personalities on the planet.
[P2593] Now think about that.
[P2594] You now have more people listening to you and your voice on a weekly basis than the major networks of our country for the last 70 years, like ABC and CBS and NBC, right?
[P2595] So,
[P2596] So your voice matters, and we're having this conversation.
[P2597] There was a time that people in the media would never talk about this because it was suicide, just like politicians.
[P2598] This topic would be considered political suicide because when you mention UFOs, people think tinfoil hats and Elvis on the mothership and nonsense like that.
[P2599] No, what we're talking about is national security, and we're also talking about the human condition, the way we process information, the way we handle new paradigms.
[P2600] I've used this before.
[P2601] And I think to its effect, my wife will kill me for saying this, she hates this analogy, but I will submit to you that there are moments in our evolution as a species
[P2602] where these paradigm moments occur, where we change fundamentally our understanding of our reality.
[P2603] And so one may argue that when we were first coming out of the cave for the very first time and gazing upon the heavens, we realized at that moment that our world just got a lot bigger.
[P2604] Another paradigm moment may be when two people were striking a rock together and all of a sudden a spark flew and they created fire.
[P2605] And for the first time, mankind could illuminate the darkness.
[P2606] And now the monsters hiding behind the trees, well, they were just bushes.
[P2607] Another paradigm moment may have been when mankind was standing on a stony beach and one fisherman says to the other, you're not going to sail over the horizon.
[P2608] And he says to them, you can't do that.
[P2609] You're going to fall off the edge.
[P2610] And oh, by the way, there's sea monsters out there, giant kraken, and you're going to get ripped apart.
[P2611] And of course, people laugh about it now.
[P2612] But you know what?
[P2613] It turns out they were right.
[P2614] There are sea monsters.
[P2615] They're just called giant squid of the Pacific and great white sharks and blue whales.
[P2616] And they're really not monsters, really.
[P2617] They're part of our nature.
[P2618] They're part of our understanding.
[P2619] And so maybe this topic of UAP, this is just yet another stony beach we're about to sail over the horizon.
[P2620] Yeah.
[P2621] We already are with AI.
[P2622] Oh, absolutely.
[P2623] I could not agree more.
[P2624] I think you're absolutely correct.
[P2625] Well, Lou.
[P2626] I don't know if we got to any of the questions you wanted to ask.
[P2627] I'm sorry.
[P2628] It's been a fascinating interview.
[P2629] And I just, it was a real pleasure to have you here.
[P2630] And I hope to see you again.
[P2631] Sean, it's my honor and privilege.
[P2632] You always have a home out in Wyoming.
[P2633] I mean it sincerely.
[P2634] Listen, you're doing great work for our country.
[P2635] You don't need to hear that from me.
[P2636] I know you hear it all the time.
[P2637] But truly, truly, from somebody who spent a little bit of time in the media,
[P2638] you are providing a great service to our nation.
[P2639] And even if it has nothing to do with the UFO topic, the fact that you're willing to put yourself out there, have these meaningful conversations and allow your audience to be part of that, history will remember you very kindly.
[P2640] You are,
[P2641] You are setting a new tone for how America gets its information without a filter, by the way, before with the networks.
[P2642] Remember, you had all sorts of people coming up and putting spins on things.
[P2643] And this is what you are doing.
[P2644] is a tremendous service for our nation and humanity.
[P2645] So thank you sincerely.
[P2646] My wife is a big fan of yours.
[P2647] Really appreciate what you're doing.
[P2648] And I appreciate all the guests you've had in the past and all the guests you're having in the future.
[P2649] Even if some of those guests in the past don't like me very much, thank you for doing what you're doing.
[P2650] Thank you for saying that.
[P2651] You got it.
[P2652] Honor and privilege.
[P2653] Thank you.
[P2654] That's what I'm looking forward to seeing.
[P2655] Good.
[P2656] Then you are ready for football.
[P2657] With the Rich Eisen Show podcast.
