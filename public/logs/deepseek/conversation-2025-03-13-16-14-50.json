think I've behaved over the last 10, 15 years.\nWe see them as kind of an afterthought to everything else in many regards.\nSo the amount of effort I put into my businesses and to the podcast and to every little detail, the creativity, the thought, the brainstorming, all of that.\nRelationships, we kind of all just think they just happen.\nAnd if it doesn't happen perfectly, then it's broken and I need to find a new one.\n Yeah, that's a terrible way to think.\nI mean, and everybody knows it.\nIf you give the best of yourself at work, if you bring the leftovers home, if when you come home, you say, I've given everything I had.\nNow I'm just putting my feet on the table.\nI just need to chill.\nI don't want to make any effort.\nYou know, slowly your relationship degrades, period.\nAnd then there's all kinds of ways it ends.\nNone of them are particularly joyful.\n And basically, if people were able to put a little bit of creativity, attention, attention into their relationships as they do with their customers or their guests, relationships would be doing a lot better and my profession would be seeing a lot less people.\nAnd there's no doubt.\nAnd why are people so lazy, so complacent, so unimaginative, right?\n with their relationships at home.\nI mean, I see so many people when you, like here, you know, you're not taking out your phone.\nYou're not, you're looking at me, you're paying attention on occasion, you look for your questions and where we go, but basically you're with me.\nBut at home, if you do this or this.\nLooking at my phone.\nYou know, and then when the person tells you something really important, you go, uh-huh.\n Uh-huh.\nYou know, and you're kind of there, but not present.\nAnd that's the beginning of a kind of modern loneliness, actually, is that this idea that you can share something really important to someone who is half there, half there.\nAnd I think that that's what's happening with a lot of younger people these days, is that they experience a lot of half there-ness.\nYeah.\n And that begins to cultivate a real sense of loneliness that has to do not with I'm physically alone, that has to do with do I matter?\nWho hears me?\nWho cares?\nWho pays attention?\nWho notices me?\n You know, so I, sometimes the advice is very banal, you know, it's to tell people, put your freaking phone down, take an hour and put your phone down.\nBut I'm busy.\nHuh?\nBut I'm busy.\n that you will be busy and there won't be a relationship.\nSooner or later, there won't be a relationship.\nIt's not difficult.\nYou can wait, you can wait for the kids to grow up if there are kids involved, etc.\nBut in the end, there isn't.\nJust because someone was on their phone?\n Well, it's not just on the phone.\nIt's on the phone means I am continuously saying something is more important than you.\nWe come last.\nWe're a cactus.\nWe don't need to be watered.\nWe can survive in a desert.\nIt's called, there's a term I've been using for this that is, I borrow from something else.\nIt's called ambiguous loss.\nHave you ever heard of this term?\nAmbiguous loss?\nYeah.\nNo.\nNo.\n Biggest loss is a term that was developed by a colleague, Pauline Boss, a wonderful psychologist, when she talked about what happens when you have a parent, for example, that has Alzheimer.\nThey are physically present, but they are psychologically gone.\nThey're emotionally absent.\n And you can't really mourn them because they're still physically there, but you're caught in this in-between, in this ambiguous loss.\nOn the other side, you can have somebody who is deployed, hostage,\n Miscarriage, they are emotionally very present, but they are physically absent.\nIn both cases, it's an ambiguous loss.\nYou can't, are they still there or are they gone?\nWho knows?\nWhen we live with this phone thing,\n When we are, because you've been at work, you've been at the computer, you come home, you think, I'm so happy to finally let go of the computer.\nYou turn on the TV, you turn on the TV and then you turn on the phone at the same time.\nYou're watching here, you're watching there and there's a person next to you.\nAnd most likely they often do the same thing in the end too.\n And gradually, you know, there is less and less of a thread of conversation, of connection, of joy, of sex, of intimacy, all of what, you know, that becomes ambiguous loss.\nSomebody is there, but they're not really present.\nI'm, you know, is there a difference between me and the sofa?\n It's comfy.\nIt's routine.\nYou sit on me.\nBut comfy and routine do not give us joy or meaning or relevance or connection.\nAnd that's what we still seem to want.\nSo it means saying to people, you know, it's actually not very, very complicated.\nWhat did people do for centuries?\nThey took walks.\n That's one of the few times you can't click.\nSo take a walk.\nDon't sit.\nDon't try to do, you know, take a walk around the block and just be in motion.\nThen you parallel, you know, it's not face to face, it's side by side.\nAnd you can talk about the day.\nIf you, instead of just saying, stop, stop, stop, you just said, you know, let's go for a walk.\nIt's London, but still you can, you know, and you do half an hour walk.\nIt will change.\n You'll come back to me and you tell me what it will do.\nBut it's amazing how these small interventions that are playful, creative, not digging, change the dynamic of the relationship.\nBecause she is only pursuing you in part because of how much you are withdrawing.\nYou change, she change.\nIf you want to change the other, change yourself.\n Once you understood the figure eight and how we create the other, you understand that if you do something else, sooner or later, they do something else too.\nSo if you want to change the other, change you.\nThis is part of the question you asked me, right?\nWhat are some of the essential understandings of working with relational systems?\nThis is true at work, in companies.\nThis is true in intimate relationships.\nThis is not just for romantic love.\nThis is foundations of relational systems.\n feedback loop it's called in cybernetics so many busy couples can feel the spark in their relationship waning away slowly but\n Work isn't necessarily the first place you look.\nLike pulling out the phone at dinner isn't necessarily the place people look because that seems so small.\nSo they aim at bigger things.\nThey'll say, I don't know, something bigger.\nBut do you believe, are you saying that you believe a lot of it, much of it often starts with those small moments of disconnection where the person basically ends up becoming the sofa?\nThe Gottmans call them bids for connection.\nBids for connection.\nBids.\n You know, it's the little things.\nIt's the difference between turning towards someone or turning away.\nYou know, when you read something, there's a classic example they give.\nDo you read something?\nDo you actually say, hey, did you read this?\nLet me send you this article.\n That's a bid for connection.\nIt's not a big declaration, but it says we're in this together.\nWhen I see something that's interesting that I think you would like to read as well, I share it.\nI'm thinking of you.\nI know you exist even if I'm not with you.\nDo you know what my partner said to me something about a year ago?\nAnd we stayed with me because I thought that's such a strange thing to say.\n She said to me when we were in conflict resolution.\nSo we were talking about things.\nShe said, you know, when I send you things on Instagram, in Instagram DMs, like I'll be out here now in New York.\nSo if she sees something interesting on Instagram, she sends it to me.\nShe goes, you've stopped acknowledging it.\nI used to just like double tap on it or make a comment back.\nShe goes, you've stopped.\nYou stopped acknowledging it.\n And I thought, why does that matter?\nWhy does it, like, you send me something, I watch the funny video, I crack on with my day.\nBecause it's like when you receive a birthday gift, do you think?\nYeah.\nWhen you buy a birthday gift, is it important to give it?\nYeah.\nOkay, that's the reason.\n I mean, how would she know that you watched it if there is no acknowledgement?\nAnd the acknowledgement is not about the video or the DM.\nThe acknowledgement is we share something.\n Well, it's even worse because it says seen on Instagram.\nSo it says that I've seen it.\nYes, but the seen it means that I have seen the video.\nThe acknowledgement is we are part of a thread.\nWe're connected.\nShe's absolutely right.\nSo in that sense, when people lose the spark, it is a lot of these small details that people say so much in the beginning.\nYou know, all the positive stuff that people lose.\nAnd it's actually...\n only more important with time rather than less important with time.\nThe death of a relationship is when people take each other for granted.\nAnd when you stop acknowledging those things, it is part of the mechanisms of taking for granted.\n\""
