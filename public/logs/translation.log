  "output": "其实啊，这归根结底是个风险偏好的问题。你看美国，人均创业者数量是欧洲的五倍，每个初创企业能拿到的投资额也是欧洲的五倍。在美国，每家初创企业平均能拿到500万美元的风险投资，而在欧洲只有100万。\n\n说到这个，我想起康斯坦丁（Constantine）之前提到餐厅的例子。几周前我去Soho一家叫Dig In的小餐馆，特别棒。我特别喜欢，临走时还留了名片，说能不能见见老板。"

  "output": "你看啊，现在美国这边的情况挺有意思的。单身女性买房的比例已经超过单身男性了。而且在大城市里，30岁以下的女性收入也比同龄男性要高。\n\n但是呢，当男性失去了感情关系、工作或者学业这些\"护栏\"的时候，他们有时候会把精力投入到一些不太好的事情上。比如说，可能会变得特别厌女，或者陷入极端民族主义，甚至相信一些阴谋论。有些人就变成了特别糟糕的公民，完全把自己和社会隔离开来。\n\n说实话，我现在最担心的就是，美国可能会出现一种新型的\"无性恋\"群体。这些人既不谈恋爱，也不参与社会活动，就这么把自己封闭起来。"

And one of the reasons is it was just something that the media sort of covered and then moved on, when it actually should have been something we talked about on",

Scott, when I was listening to that Zuckerberg interview talking about masculinity and identity issues, one of the lines he said in there, like something you've said on my show before, where he said, I think having a culture that celebrates that aggression a little bit more, talking about masculinity, has its own merits that are really positive.",

You're celebrated for creating surplus value. You create more tax revenue than you absorb. You're celebrated for being aggressive. You're celebrated for breaking up fights at bars. not starting them.",

  "output": "你看啊，在美国，你得赚到平均工资的六倍才会触及最高税率。但在英国，只要达到平均工资的两倍半，你就得面对这个高税率了。所以一旦你的收入达到平均工资的两倍半，麻烦就来了。英国有很多人故意把收入控制在5万英镑以内，因为超过5万英镑，40%的收入都要交税。很多人就直接放弃了，他们说\"我不干了\"。我认识一些特别聪明、特别有才华的人，他们本可以赚得更多，但就是不愿意交那40%的税。"

He loves a fight. He obviously has the kind of mind that can't relax unless he's kind of grinding up against some gear. as well.",

In some, they become really shitty citizens. They become sequestered from society. So I'm worried in the U.S., our biggest threat is a new species of asexual. asocial young men who are incredibly dangerous have opted out of America.",

The moment you start advocating for a special advantage based on any external factors, I think at this point in our society, it probably causes more problems than it solves. That's exactly right. That's exactly right, Stephen. take a step back and look at why DEI has become such a big part of the conversation, it's precisely because instead of addressing the reality of people's lives, which is some people are disadvantaged and some people are advantaged, actually what we've mainly done, and Scott alluded to at the very beginning of our discussion, is we've given a leg up to very wealthy ethnic minority people from successful families, and they now, their children now get into prestigious universities, which they probably would have done anyway, some of them, because they come from very advanced backgrounds.",

What does it mean for philosophy? What does it mean for humanity? What does it mean for, how do we build rules in a world in which you have these machines that take every rule literally and suddenly you find that, you know, the desire to protect humanity results in the end of humanity.",

Now, people who are associated with the company could be a variety of people. It could be the CEO. It could be lower level employees. It could be the sales department. It could be people in research and development. It could also be customers, suppliers, and industry experts, et cetera. But let's circle back here to why Scuttlebutt is so essential. Let's say I know a retail business pretty well.",

This episode has some great case studies to really hammer home how important Scuttlebutt is.

And that's all fine and dandy, but in the example above, I'm still making some sort of error.

The origin of the term is related to sailing. Water for consumption on sailing ships was typically stored in a scuttlebutt, a butt or a cask, which had been scuttled by making a hole in it so the water could be withdrawn. Since sailors exchanged gossip when they gathered at the scuttlebutt for a drink of water, scuttlebutt became slang for gossip or rumors. equivalent of water cooler talk.",

Now, I personally have never shorted a stock in my life, but I think if a company is likely to go down in price, that's probably a pretty good thing to know if I'm contemplating going long on that idea.

The second one is going to be employees. Number three would be suppliers. And the fourth is specialists.

  "input": "Either the debt would be restructured, which was very good for the company and the stock price, or the bankers would force the company to pay, which tended to be unfavorable for the business and its stock price. So it's easy to understand why. If a business has its interest payments cut, that means its pre-tax income goes up and earnings will probably show a bump. If a company must pay increased interest expense, pre-tax income decreases and earnings will suffer. So Michelle had observed that there was an ad agency that she watched where the business borrowed about $10 million from this bank.",
  "output": "要么债务重组，这对公司和股价都是好事；要么银行逼着公司还钱，这对业务和股价都不利。你看，这道理其实很简单。如果一家公司的利息支出减少了，那税前收入就会增加，盈利很可能就会往上走。反过来，如果公司要支付更多利息，税前收入就会减少，盈利就会受影响。米歇尔（Michelle）就注意到一家广告公司，她一直在关注这家公司，他们从银行借了大概1000万美元。"

This is a pretty rare relationship to find. That's not to say that you must have these types of relationships to find successful investments, but it doesn't hurt to find out more about the relationship that a company has with its suppliers. So here's what Monish said about win-lose relationships between a business and its suppliers. which you could call win-lose.",

Now, just like former employees, speaking with former suppliers can be a great source of information, as you're likely to get to the truth quickly. It also helps identify any potential weaknesses a business might have. You should probe into why the business relationship was severed, what the former supplier thinks of management, the history of payments, whether they were on time or late, negotiating leverage between the supplier and the company, etc.",

This is why having a business with multiple suppliers is good and a good thing to know. It protects you if something goes wrong with one supplier.",

There might be one supplier who's key to a whole bunch of different companies that require it for their business to run.

When looking at a business that is attractive primarily because it's valued below some of the parts, do not bother with the business.

But there's another area of improvement that relates directly to the circle of competence. God and Bay had a great definition of what the circle of competence is. When you are unsure and doubtful about what you want to do, do not do it.",

Many value investors like investments whose value comes from a business's assets. For instance, you might buy a company where the assets of a business are worth $2 billion while the company is only trading for a billion or $500 million.

  "output": "我在其中三笔投资里都亏了钱，而且亏得还不少。这确实是个很有意思的学习点。第三点呢，就是要试着找出我犯错时的共同点。我觉得这些共同点其实挺明显的，就是那些公司业务拆分后的价值总和比股价要高。我知道这种思维模式以前就吸引过我，结果让我亏了不少钱。所以现在看新投资机会的时候，我就可以利用这一点来避免重蹈覆辙。这就引出了第四点：在做分析的时候，要避免这些模式。"

As I just alluded to here, if one business can take 40, 80, 100 hours to sleuth or to understand better, that's going to be a business that probably you want to put a lot of money behind. And it's not going to be something where you're going to want to just put 1% in.

He said, I never disagree with someone else's opinion unless I understand their side better than they do. Now, in my opinion, Scuttlebutt will help you determine if a business would make a better short than a long. Now, I personally have never shorted a stock in my life, but I think if a company is likely to go down in price, that's probably a pretty good thing to know if I'm contemplating going long on that idea. Now, suppose you know that a business has, a 90% customer concentration.",

In that case, that's probably really, really good evidence that the company is likely to be worth just a lot less once that news comes out and probably for a long time into the future, maybe forever into the future. Scuttlebutt can help you determine which types of events can build or destroy conviction. So there's a business that I loosely followed. It's a microcap called Avricor Health. This business just crushed it going from about $0.07 to 24 cents in less than a year.",

  "input": "So there was a really good book that I read in prepping for this episode called Scuttlebutt Investor. And so here's what the definition of scuttlebutt was. The origin of the term is related to sailing. Water for consumption on sailing ships was typically stored in a scuttlebutt, a butt or a cask, which had been scuttled by making a hole in it so the water could be withdrawn. Since sailors exchanged gossip when they gathered at the scuttlebutt for a drink of water, scuttlebutt became slang for gossip or rumors. equivalent of water cooler talk.",
  "output": "我为了准备这期节目读了一本特别棒的书，叫《小道消息投资者》。说到这个\"scuttlebutt\"的定义啊，它的起源其实跟航海有关。以前在帆船上，饮用水通常储存在一个叫\"scuttlebutt\"的木桶里，就是在桶上打个洞方便取水。水手们聚在木桶边喝水的时候就会闲聊八卦，所以\"scuttlebutt\"就慢慢变成了小道消息或者谣言的代名词，相当于我们现在说的\"饮水机谈话\"那种感觉。"

If you can speak with employees when they're in more of a casual setting, you're likely to get better information than if you maybe just go to the IR office of a business that's in your local neighborhood and they're just showing you around the workplace. In that scenario, you might just get people that are going to be on their best behavior, even if maybe they don't necessarily and make the optics look good.",

So the fourth area here is just talking to specialists. I love talking with specialists. I think it's a great source, If you speak to someone who owns a stock, you're likely to hear very cheery news from other bulls about that company.",

You'll appreciate the switching costs involved with using a different product. You'll know if the product keeps you as a captive customer and if you are annoyed or happy to pay more over time. For instance, I see the price of streaming services continue to increase while I think the service isn't getting any better. Amazon hasn't really increased prices, but now it shows ads every time I watch it. Netflix, continues raising its ad-free prices or allows users to go with ads, but at a reduced price.",

So I have kind of this four-step process, and I'll expand the example that I just used a few minutes ago here. So the first one is looking where your most significant losses are. So for me, I also look at businesses where perhaps the investment didn't lose money, but my thought process, ended up being kind of wrong.",

Some of my least successful investments have been when the primary driver of the investment, like I just said, was doing this sum of the parts calculation. I'd see very clearly that the sum of the parts was much higher than the share price and then buy it, hoping that gap would close. Now I've had kind of about four investments in this area.",

The style grew in popularity on sites like Tumblr and MySpace and was often seen as a counterculture reaction to the economic climate of the recession. Yeah.",

Yeah, we've seen that many times with fighters. get so enthusiastic about their training yeah because i feel like self-confidence and still there is something what you can do better yeah every day and that's my idea of the training life life idea to to to go better every day one percent better one percent better even if you don't if you can't train you can sit in a and visualize how you train, how the body is working.",
