分析结果：
我觉得现在这些公益广告越来越有意思了，它们总是用最温和的语气说着最可怕的事情。比如这个：“加速气候行动，改善全球生活。”听起来就像是在说：“嘿，伙计们，地球要完蛋了，但别担心，我们正在努力让它死得慢一点！”而且每次听到“改善生活”我就想笑，我们连自己的WiFi都改善不了，还想着改善全球生活。不过话说回来，至少他们还在努力，不像我，连垃圾分类都分不明白，每天都在纠结那个奶茶杯到底是可回收还是不可回收。

分析结果：
我觉得播客制作团队的名单念起来特别好笑，每次听到都像是在听一场颁奖典礼。你看，有制作人、工程师、事实核查员，还有编辑，每个人都有自己的头衔，搞得特别正式。但说实话，我们听众根本分不清谁是谁，只知道这些人都在幕后忙活。这就像你去餐厅吃饭，服务员给你介绍每道菜的厨师、配菜师、摆盘师，你只会想：能不能快点上菜？我饿了！

分析结果：
我觉得用AI重建记忆这件事挺可怕的。想象一下，你正沉浸在美好的回忆里，突然AI给你生成了一张照片，结果发现你妈穿的是你爸的衣服，你的发型像个鸡窝。这哪是重建记忆，这是摧毁记忆啊！而且万一AI把你的初恋对象生成了一张你现任的脸，那可就尴尬了。我觉得未来记忆还是留在脑子里比较好，至少不会出现这种'技术性失忆'的情况。

分析结果：
「最近看到一条广告，说有个基金会在推动创新来应对气候变化。我就想，这可能是唯一一个让人类‘创新’不是为了给自己找麻烦的项目。我们发明了塑料，然后发明了垃圾分类；发明了汽车，然后发明了限行；发明了空调，然后发明了全球变暖。现在终于有人意识到，创新应该用来解决我们之前创新造成的问题了。这就像你把你家房子烧了，然后发明灭火器，最后还得了个创新奖。」

分析结果：
我觉得这些政府部门的裁员计划特别讽刺。你看，法官暂停了一个裁员项目，结果 CIA 又搞了个类似的。这就像你在减肥，一边在健身房办了卡，一边又在冰箱里塞满了巧克力。政府部门也是一样，一边说要精简机构，一边又悄咪咪地搞裁员。最搞笑的是，他们还要开听证会讨论裁员计划，这就像在开一场“如何优雅地解雇员工”的研讨会。我觉得与其这么折腾，不如直接发个公告：“亲爱的员工，由于我们太有钱了，所以决定裁员。谢谢理解。”这样至少大家都省心了。

分析结果：
我觉得这个就业数据特别有意思。每个月政府都会发布这些数字，好像在告诉我们：“看，经济在好转！”但每次我看到这些数据，我都在想，这143,000个新工作里，有多少是像我这样的“自由职业者”？就是那种在家穿着睡衣，一边吃泡面一边刷剧，然后告诉别人“我在创业”的人。失业率降到4%？我觉得这个数字根本不算什么，因为现在很多人都是“假装在工作”。比如我那个朋友，每天在朋友圈晒加班照片，其实就是在办公室打王者荣耀。所以，与其关注这些数字，不如问问自己：“我到底是在工作，还是在假装工作？”

分析结果：
现象层：我们总是听到各种基金会和机构在宣传他们的伟大使命，比如“加速气候行动”和“改善全球生活”，听起来好像他们马上就能拯救世界了。

态度层：每次听到这种宣传，我都觉得既感动又困惑，感动的是他们有这么宏伟的目标，困惑的是为什么世界还没被拯救。

逻辑层：如果这些基金会真的这么有效，为什么我们还在为气候变化和生活质量发愁？难道他们的“加速”是以蜗牛的速度为标准？

解释层：其实，这些基金会的主要功能是让我们感觉良好。他们就像是在给地球开安慰剂，告诉我们“别担心，有人在努力”。而真正的效果？可能跟你在健身房办了年卡但只去过一次差不多。

分析结果：
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: 每次听到节目最后的工作人员名单，我就特别感慨。你说这些人得有多大的耐心啊，天天对着稿子改来改去，核对事实，调整音效。这工作简直比甲方还甲方，但至少他们知道自己是在为听众服务，而不是为了满足某个老板的突发奇想。

[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: 我特别佩服那个事实核查员，每天要在海量信息里找出真相。这工作压力得多大啊，万一出错了，整个节目组都得背锅。但转念一想，这工作也挺有意思的，就像是在玩一个大型的“大家来找茬”游戏，只不过赌注是节目的信誉。

[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: 最让我好奇的是那个音效工程师，他们是怎么把各种声音调得那么恰到好处的？是不是得有个“音效库”，里面存着各种奇奇怪怪的声音？比如“咖啡机运转声”、“键盘敲击声”、“深夜办公室的叹息声”之类的。这工作简直就是在用声音讲故事，只不过听众可能永远不知道幕后发生了什么。

[P119] [SPEAKER_01]: 最后，我想对节目编辑说句话：你们辛苦了！你们的工作就像是给节目穿上了一件看不见的外套，让整个节目看起来既专业又有趣。虽然观众可能永远不知道你们的存在，但你们的存在让整个节目变得更好。这大概就是幕后英雄的真谛吧。

分析结果：
我觉得公司发这种“岔路口”邮件特别可笑，就像在说：“亲爱的员工们，我们正站在命运的十字路口，要么继续前进，要么原地爆炸。”但现实是，我们根本没有选择权，只能被动接受公司高层的决定。这让我想起小时候玩的那种“选择你自己的冒险”游戏，翻到第27页：你被解雇了，游戏结束。至少游戏还会给你个痛快，公司却要假装我们还有选择的余地，真是太讽刺了。

「最近政府搞了个买断计划，结果被联邦法官叫停了。法官下周要听取各方意见，我猜主要是听听到底有多少人想跑路。不过CIA那边倒是另起炉灶，也搞了个类似的辞职计划。这让我想起我们公司的年终奖方案，也是各种版本满天飞，最后发现哪个都兑现不了。看来不管是政府还是企业，在画大饼这件事上倒是出奇的一致。只是CIA这个辞职计划有点意思，我建议他们应该加个保密条款：'同意辞职的员工不得透露自己为什么辞职'，这样才能保持CIA的一贯风格。」

分析结果：
问题：气候变化太严重，但个人行动感觉杯水车薪，怎么办？

解决方案：发明一种“碳足迹连连看”游戏，把每个人的环保行为都变成积分。比如，骑自行车上班可以连成一条线，自带购物袋可以消除一对，种一棵树直接消除一整排。最后，谁先消除完自己的碳足迹，谁就能获得“地球拯救者”称号。这样一来，环保不仅成了游戏，还能激发大家的竞争欲，说不定比政府号召还管用。

反转：结果大家都沉迷于刷积分，反而忘了真正去保护环境，最后地球变成了一个巨大的游戏机，人类成了里面的NPC。

我觉得马斯克收购推特这件事真是太奇怪了。一个整天在推特上发火箭表情的人，居然真的买下了整个平台。现在好了，推特变成了X，员工变成了前员工，赔偿金变成了诉讼金。马斯克可能觉得X代表未知数，但他忘了X也代表错误答案。现在几千名前员工要找他算账，他可能又要发推特了：「抱歉，我按错了按钮，本来想买特斯拉股票的。」

[P120] [SPEAKER_08]: That's on the TED Radio Hour podcast from NPR.

分析结果：
你有没有想过，为什么我们总是执着于用AI重现记忆？可能是因为我们的大脑其实是个很糟糕的摄影师。它总是把重要的细节拍糊了，把不重要的东西拍得特别清晰。比如，你明明想记住和初恋的第一次约会，结果大脑却把隔壁桌那盘特别难吃的意大利面拍得清清楚楚。所以现在我们用AI来修复记忆，其实是在给大脑这个蹩脚摄影师擦屁股。更讽刺的是，我们花大价钱用AI重现的记忆，可能比我们真实的记忆还要真实。这就像你请了个替身演员来演你自己，结果他演得比你更像你。所以未来，我们可能会面临一个哲学难题：到底是AI重现的记忆更真实，还是我们模糊的记忆更真实？这大概就是为什么有人说，记忆是个骗子，而AI是个更专业的骗子。

分析结果：
「最新数据显示，一月份新增了14.3万个工作岗位，失业率微降至4%。这让我想起我找工作的时候，投了143份简历，最后只收到4个面试邀请。看来我和经济一样，都在努力创造就业机会，只不过我是那个需要被就业的岗位。

经济学家说这是经济复苏的好兆头，但我觉得这更像是HR在年底冲KPI。毕竟一月份大家都在写新年计划，'找新工作'可是排名前三的热门选项。

说实话，我对这些数据有点怀疑。他们统计的可能是全职、兼职、临时工，但肯定没算上我这种'全职找工作'的人。如果把我算进去，失业率可能会飙升到104%。」

我觉得“Jobs Friday”这个说法特别有意思，它让我想起每次发工资的日子。我们总是期待着这一天，好像它能解决所有问题，但实际上，工资到账的那一刻，我的银行账户就像是在跟我开玩笑，数字闪了一下就消失了。这让我觉得，与其叫“Jobs Friday”，不如叫“Money Disappears Friday”更贴切。每次看到工资单，我都会想，这些钱是不是去度假了，因为它们总是来去匆匆，从不留宿。

我觉得疫苗和自闭症挂钩这个谣言特别可笑，就像有人说吃胡萝卜会变聪明一样荒谬。但更可笑的是，这种谣言居然能流传几十年，而且还有人信。这让我想起我奶奶，她到现在还相信吃猪脑能补脑，每次我考试前都要逼我吃一碗。我说：“奶奶，我要是真吃了，可能连考试都忘了去。”这谣言就像我奶奶的猪脑汤，明明没科学依据，却总有人觉得“宁可信其有”。最讽刺的是，那些散布谣言的人，自己生病了第一个跑去打疫苗，就像我奶奶，天天说西药有毒，感冒了还不是偷偷吃感冒药。

[P110] [SPEAKER_06]: But possible byproduct of the Trump administration's designs to thin out the federal workforce is that people may begin to understand firsthand what happens when you gut the federal government.

分析结果：
我觉得特朗普政府削减联邦雇员的做法特别愚蠢。就像你为了减肥，不是去健身房，而是直接把腿给锯了。现在大家终于能亲身体会到，当政府被掏空时会发生什么——就像你去餐厅点了一桌菜，结果发现厨房里连厨师都没有。最讽刺的是，那些喊着要削减政府规模的人，往往是第一个抱怨为什么他们的护照要等三个月才能办下来的人。这让我想起我那个总说要减肥的朋友，一边喊着要节食，一边偷偷点外卖。说到底，我们不是讨厌政府，我们只是讨厌效率低下的政府。但把政府裁得只剩下一个空壳，这可不是提高效率的正确方式。

分析结果：
我觉得这位国家公园服务局的员工真是太可爱了。她说她从来没想过辞职，完全致力于公共服务。这让我想起我那个在政府工作的朋友，他也总是说：“我爱我的工作！”然后每个月都在为工资单发愁。你知道吗？这些联邦雇员不仅是国家公园的守护者，还是确保你能拿到退税的人。想象一下，如果他们都辞职了，我们可能连退税都拿不到，那才真是“国家公园”变成“国家荒地”了。所以，下次你去国家公园，别忘了对那些清洁工和会计们说声谢谢，因为他们可能正在为你的退税加班加点呢！

主题：裁员计划与Twitter案例的对比 - insight

输入内容：
[P59] [SPEAKER_02]: The fork in the road email shared similarities with the memo that Twitter employees received in 2022 after Elon Musk took over.
[P60] [SPEAKER_02]: It even used the title fork in the road.

分析结果：
这让我想起了现代职场的一个有趣现象：领导们似乎都特别钟情于"十字路口"这个比喻。每次公司遇到重大决策，他们都要发一封"十字路口"的邮件，仿佛我们不是在上班，而是在参加一场人生哲理研讨会。

仔细想想，这其实暴露了管理层的一个矛盾心理：他们既想显得高瞻远瞩，又害怕承担责任。所以就用"十字路口"这种模棱两可的说法，把决策的压力转嫁给员工。就好像在说："看，我指出了方向，至于选哪条路，那是你们的事。"

最讽刺的是，这些所谓的"十字路口"，往往只有一条路是通的。其他方向要么是死胡同，要么是悬崖。就像马斯克接手推特时的那封邮件，表面上给了员工选择，实际上是在暗示："要么接受我的改革，要么走人。"

所以下次再收到"十字路口"的邮件，我们不妨直接问："领导，您能在地图上标出哪条路是通往加薪的吗？"

[P121] [SPEAKER_08]: On the ThruLine podcast, the myth linking autism and vaccines was decades in the making and was a major moment for vaccine hesitancy in America, tapping into fears involving the pharmaceutical industry and the federal government.

「我特别喜欢听经济新闻，尤其是就业报告。每次听到失业率下降，我就特别有安全感——因为这说明至少还有人在工作。不过最让我安心的还是听到GDP增长，虽然我也不太懂是什么意思，但听起来就像在说‘大家都有钱赚’一样。其实我觉得经济学家应该多讲点人话，比如‘经济复苏’可以翻译成‘大家可以开始点外卖了’，‘通货膨胀’就是‘泡面涨价了’。这样我们普通人才能更好地理解经济形势，而不是每次听到‘量化宽松’就以为是某种新型减肥方法。」

分析结果：
你知道吗，每次看到就业数据上升，我都觉得这背后有个巨大的阴谋。你看，经济增加了14.3万个工作岗位，失业率降到了4%。表面上看起来是好事，但仔细一想，这不就是老板们在疯狂招人，好让每个人都忙得没时间抱怨工资低吗？而且，失业率下降，意味着更多人要开始还房贷、车贷，这不就是银行和车商的阴谋吗？他们巴不得每个人都忙得团团转，没时间思考自己到底在为什么而工作。所以，下次看到就业数据上升，别高兴得太早，这可能只是资本家们的新一轮“奴役计划”罢了！

你知道吗，国际转账的隐藏费用其实是一种保护机制。想象一下，如果没有这些费用，我们可能会陷入一个全球性的货币狂欢中。人们会疯狂地跨国转账，今天买个法国的面包，明天订个日本的寿司，后天再买个意大利的披萨。全球经济会陷入混乱，货币市场会像过山车一样起伏不定。所以，这些隐藏费用实际上是在保护我们，防止我们因为太方便而把世界搞得一团糟。WISE的透明汇率，其实是在挑战这种保护机制，让我们在享受便利的同时，也要承担起维护全球经济稳定的责任。

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - attitude

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
我觉得政府这种“带薪休假”的裁员方式特别讽刺。就好像在说：“亲爱的员工，我们不想再见到你了，但请继续领工资到九月，就当是我们的分手礼物。”这简直是最温柔的解雇方式，比“你被炒了”听起来舒服多了。我猜他们是想让员工在离开前还能享受一下“政府福利”，毕竟以后可能就没机会了。这就像是在分手时说：“我们还是朋友，你可以继续用我的Netflix账号到月底。”

[P12] [SPEAKER_02]: But is this offer even legal?
[P13] [SPEAKER_02]: Just yesterday, a federal judge paused the offer until at least Monday of next week.
[P14] [SPEAKER_02]: Today on the show, an employment lawyer walks us through the government's deal, which has plunged the federal workforce into confusion and uncertainty.
[P15] [SPEAKER_02]: And we talked to some of those government employees about how they've been weighing this critical decision to stay or go.

分析结果：
我觉得这个政府offer简直太愚蠢了。它就像一个不负责任的男朋友，先给你画个大饼，然后突然说"等等，我还没想好要不要跟你在一起"。那些公务员们现在肯定像热锅上的蚂蚁，一边担心自己的工作，一边还要研究法律条文。最搞笑的是，连法官都看不下去了，直接按了暂停键。这让我想起我那个总是出尔反尔的前任，每次都说要复合，结果第二天就改主意。至少我这个前任不会影响整个国家的运转，而这个offer却让整个联邦政府陷入了混乱。我觉得这些公务员现在的心情，大概就像在玩俄罗斯轮盘赌，只不过赌的不是子弹，而是自己的职业生涯。

输入内容：
[P86] [SPEAKER_02]: There's also the cautionary tale of Twitter, the last organization to get Elon Musk's fork in the road memo.
[P87] [SPEAKER_02]: The company, now known as X, is reportedly facing lawsuits from thousands of former employees who say that, among other things, they didn't get the severance package they were promised.

分析结果：
说到埃隆·马斯克收购Twitter这件事，真是让人哭笑不得。他给公司改名叫X，结果员工们得到的不是X战警的超能力，而是X档案般的未解之谜——说好的遣散费去哪儿了？

这让我想起一个笑话：马斯克买Twitter就像买了一套精装修的房子，结果一进门发现装修公司把所有的家具都搬走了，还留下一张纸条：“亲爱的房东，我们决定把您的家具捐给慈善机构，希望您能理解我们的善意。”

更讽刺的是，马斯克一直标榜自己是创新先锋，结果在员工待遇这件事上，他倒是很“传统”——继承了资本家最经典的那套：承诺给员工画大饼，最后连饼渣都不剩。

现在这些前员工集体起诉，我猜马斯克可能会说：“你们应该感到荣幸，这可是我亲自设计的裁员方案，灵感来自我的火星移民计划——先把你送到一个陌生的环境，然后让你自生自灭。”

分析结果：
联邦法官暂停了买断计划，下周要听辩论。与此同时，CIA也发出了类似的辞职邀请。这让我想到一个解决方案：干脆把政府裁员变成一个全民参与的真人秀节目。每集都有不同的部门进行“谁最该被裁”的辩论，观众投票决定去留。最后获胜的部门可以获得“年度最精简机构”奖，而输家则要参加“公务员再就业训练营”。这样不仅解决了裁员难题，还能创收，一举两得。当然，最大的反转可能是：最后发现最该被裁的其实是这个节目的制作人。

这种现象，我觉得唯一合理的解释是，所有大公司的人力资源部门都共用同一本《裁员指南》。就像武侠小说里各大门派都有一本《葵花宝典》一样，只不过他们的版本是《裁员宝典》。你看，连标题都一模一样，这肯定不是巧合，而是因为这本宝典的第一章就写着：“裁员时，一定要用‘分岔路口’这个比喻，这样显得既文艺又体面，让员工觉得不是被裁，而是自己选择了另一条人生道路。”所以啊，下次你收到“分岔路口”的邮件，别慌，先翻翻《裁员宝典》，看看下一页是不是写着“请收拾好个人物品”。

[P107] [SPEAKER_04]: Critics worry that a hatchet versus scalpel approach to the government workforce will have consequences.
[P108] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says in his experience, the vast majority of federal employees are dedicated to their mission.
[P109] [SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.
[P110] [SPEAKER_06]: But possible byproduct of the Trump administration's designs to thin out the federal workforce is that people may begin to understand firsthand what happens when you gut the federal government.

分析结果：
我觉得特朗普政府削减联邦雇员的做法特别有意思，就像是在玩一个"拆东墙补西墙"的游戏。他们以为精简政府就能提高效率，却忘了这些公务员每天都在维持着这个国家的运转。

这就好比你嫌家里空调太费电，于是把电线给剪了。结果呢？电是省了，但你也热成狗了。政府裁员也是一样的道理，表面上看是节省了开支，但实际上是在拆解整个社会的基础设施。

最讽刺的是，那些支持裁员的人，往往是最依赖政府服务的人。他们抱怨政府效率低下，却忘了正是这些"低效"的公务员在处理他们的税务、保障他们的食品安全、维护他们的交通秩序。

等到裁员真正开始，他们才会发现，原来政府不是一台可以随便拆卸的机器，而是一个精密的生态系统。就像我朋友说的："你以为裁员是在修剪杂草，实际上是在砍掉支撑房屋的柱子。"

所以啊，与其盲目裁员，不如好好想想如何提高效率。毕竟，一个国家的运转，不是靠口号，而是靠那些默默无闻的公务员们日复一日的辛勤工作。

解释层：所以，Jobs Friday其实是一种心理保护机制，就像给坏消息裹了一层糖衣，给好消息加了个庆祝的理由。这可能是经济学家们最贴心的设计了，毕竟他们也知道，没人想在周一早上听到坏消息。

[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?

[P87] [SPEAKER_02]: The company, now known as X, is reportedly facing lawsuits from thousands of former employees who say that, among other things, they didn't get the severance package they were promised.

分析结果：
现象：马斯克收购Twitter后，公司改名为X，数千名前员工因未获得承诺的遣散费而提起诉讼。

态度：这种现象让人不禁思考，马斯克的管理方式是否真的适合所有企业。

逻辑：马斯克以其独特的领导风格和决策速度著称，但这种“快速行动，打破常规”的做法在Twitter这样的大型社交平台上可能并不适用。他可能过于自信，认为自己的成功经验可以复制到任何企业，忽视了Twitter的独特文化和员工期望。

解释：或许马斯克把Twitter当成了特斯拉或SpaceX，以为可以像发射火箭一样迅速改变公司。但问题是，Twitter不是火箭，员工也不是燃料，你不能简单地“点燃”他们然后期待奇迹发生。这次事件可能是马斯克学到的一课：不是所有公司都能承受他的“高速驾驶”，有时候，慢下来，听听员工的声音，可能比盲目追求速度更有效。

分析结果：
问题：每个月的“就业星期五”都让人焦虑，担心失业数据不好看。

解决方案：我们可以把“就业星期五”变成“职业体验日”。每个人在这一天都要尝试一份新工作，比如程序员去当一天厨师，厨师去当一天程序员。这样不仅能缓解失业焦虑，还能让大家体验不同职业的乐趣。

执行过程：政府推出“职业体验日”APP，随机分配每个人的临时工作。早上8点，APP会通知你今天的工作内容，然后你就去相应的公司报到。

反转效果：结果发现，程序员们做的菜比专业厨师还好吃，而厨师们写的代码居然一次就能运行成功。失业率反而上升了，因为大家都想转行。

最后，政府不得不取消“职业体验日”，因为所有人都想换工作，没人愿意干回老本行了。

[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
特朗普政府想要大幅缩减联邦政府雇员数量，这让我想到一个更荒诞的解释：其实他们是在进行一项社会实验，看看如果政府员工都失业了，会不会有人发现政府其实根本不需要那么多人。就像你家里养了一只猫，突然有一天你发现，其实你每天喂猫、铲屎，猫却从来没为你工作过。特朗普可能是在思考：我们养了300万联邦雇员，他们真的在为我们工作吗？还是只是在办公室里假装很忙，实际上是在刷推特？所以干脆来个大规模裁员，看看政府是不是还能正常运转。说不定裁员后发现，政府效率反而提高了，因为终于没人开会了。

**解决方案型脱口秀创作：**

问题：公司被收购后，员工面临不确定性，如何传达这一重大变化？

方案：使用“岔路口”作为邮件标题，暗示员工正站在选择的十字路口。

执行过程：
1. 管理层决定用“岔路口”作为邮件标题，营造一种戏剧性的氛围。
2. 邮件内容详细描述了公司未来的两种可能路径，让员工自己选择。
3. 邮件结尾附上了一个投票链接，让员工决定是继续留在公司还是另谋高就。

反转：结果发现投票链接其实是一个在线游戏，员工们在游戏中“选择”了自己的命运，而真正的决定权还是在管理层手里。

[P123] [SPEAKER_08]: Listen to ThruLine from NPR wherever you get your podcasts.

分析结果：
问题：人们总是不相信科学证据，坚持错误的观念，比如疫苗和自闭症的联系。

解决方案：既然无法用科学说服他们，那就用他们的逻辑打败他们。我们创造一个“反疫苗疫苗”，声称注射后可以免疫所有错误信息。这样，当他们拒绝接种时，实际上是在证明这个疫苗的有效性。

执行过程：首先，我们要在社交媒体上大肆宣传这个“反疫苗疫苗”，声称它是由“纯天然的非科学成分”制成，经过了“零次临床试验”。然后，我们要找一些名人代言，说他们注射后感觉“特别清醒”，甚至能“看穿主流媒体的谎言”。

反转效果：结果，那些最坚定的反疫苗人士反而成了最积极的接种者，因为他们相信这是在对抗“大药厂”的阴谋。而实际上，他们注射的只是生理盐水，但他们的行为却无意中证明了疫苗的安全性。最终，我们成功地把他们的固执变成了推广科学的有力工具。

[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.

我觉得这个“Fork in the Road”邮件简直太讽刺了。政府说要精简机构提高效率，结果发了一封邮件给200万员工，告诉他们可以主动辞职。这就像是一个减肥教练对你说：“嘿，如果你想减肥，可以选择自己饿死。”而且他们还贴心地提醒你，在你饿死之前，我们可能会先把你踢出去。这哪是什么“Fork in the Road”，分明是“Dead End in the Road”。最搞笑的是，他们说这是为了提高效率，但发这封邮件本身就是一个巨大的效率黑洞。想象一下，200万员工同时收到这封邮件，然后每个人都开始思考人生，这得浪费多少工作时间啊！

输入内容：
[P86] [SPEAKER_02]: There's also the cautionary tale of Twitter, the last organization to get Elon Musk's fork in the road memo.
[P87] [SPEAKER_02]: The company, now known as X, is reportedly facing lawsuits from thousands of former employees who say that, among other things, they didn't get the severance package they were promised.

分析结果：
问题：Twitter员工被裁员后没拿到承诺的遣散费。

解决方案：干脆把Twitter改名为“X”，这样大家就找不到原来的公司了，自然也就没人来要遣散费了。

执行过程：
1. 先发个内部通知，说公司要改名为“X”，所有员工必须重新签署合同。
2. 新合同里把遣散费条款写得特别小，小到要用显微镜才能看清。
3. 然后大规模裁员，说这是“X”公司的正常运营调整。

反转效果：
结果员工们不仅没拿到遣散费，还因为签了新合同，连原来的工龄都被清零了。这下好了，连劳动仲裁都找不到依据，只能自认倒霉。

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
我觉得这个政府提议太奇怪了，居然让联邦雇员通过发邮件辞职。这就像是说：“嘿，如果你想辞职，就在邮件主题栏写上‘辞职’两个字，我们就会给你发工资。”这简直像是在玩文字游戏，而不是处理严肃的雇佣关系。更搞笑的是，政府机构之间的说法还不一致，这让员工们更加困惑。想象一下，你发了一封辞职邮件，结果一个部门说你会拿到工资，另一个部门却说“等等，我们还没决定”。这就像是在玩“谁说了算”的游戏，而员工们成了这场游戏的棋子。我觉得这种提议不仅愚蠢，而且对员工来说太不公平了。

[P14] [SPEAKER_02]: Today on the show, an employment lawyer walks us through the government's deal, which has plunged the federal workforce into confusion and uncertainty.
[P15] [SPEAKER_02]: And we talked to some of those government employees about how they've been weighing this critical decision to stay or go.

分析结果：
现象层：政府提出的就业方案引发了联邦工作人员的困惑和不确定性，甚至被法官暂停实施。

态度层：这种混乱的局面让人不禁质疑，政府的决策到底有没有经过深思熟虑？

逻辑层：如果连法官都觉得方案有问题，需要暂停，那这个方案显然存在法律漏洞。政府员工面临留任还是离职的抉择，这种不确定性本身就是一种折磨。

解释层：唯一合理的解释是，政府其实是在进行一场大规模的社会实验，想看看在极端不确定的环境下，人类会做出怎样的选择。这就像是在玩一个现实版的“饥饿游戏”，只不过奖品不是生存，而是稳定的工作。政府可能是想通过这种方式，筛选出最忠诚和最具有冒险精神的员工，为未来的“末日生存计划”储备人才。毕竟，谁知道哪天外星人会不会突然入侵，或者僵尸病毒会不会爆发呢？到时候，这些经历过“留任还是离职”考验的员工，就是政府最宝贵的资源了。所以，这场混乱其实是一场精心设计的“压力测试”，目的是为了在末日来临时，政府还能有一支可靠的队伍。

[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

分析结果：
这让我想到一个段子：

「最近我们单位发了份通知，建议我们辞职后可以去度个长假，或者找份私企工作。这通知写得特别贴心，就差没说'祝您早日找到新工作'了。我当时就想，这通知是AI写的吧？正常人哪能这么不着调啊！

我们单位领导可能觉得我们上班就是为了打发时间，像退休大爷似的。他们大概以为我们每天就是喝喝茶、看看报，顺便领个工资。其实我们也是有家庭要养的好吗！

最搞笑的是，通知还说私企工作更有效率。我心想，那你们怎么不去私企啊？是不是觉得在公家单位摸鱼比较舒服？

现在想想，这通知可能是领导们的真心话：'你们赶紧走吧，别在这儿碍眼了。'只是他们不好意思直接说，就找了个AI来背锅。」

这个段子通过：
1. 态度：讽刺单位通知的不切实际
2. 逻辑：分析通知内容与现实的矛盾
3. 背景：补充单位员工的真实处境

[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.

[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
「政府说要精简机构提高效率，还发了封邮件叫《岔路口》。这名字起得挺有意思，岔路口，选左边是失业，选右边也是失业。最绝的是，它说你可以主动辞职，但保留工资和福利到九月。这不就是分手时说的‘我们还是朋友’吗？而且更狠的是，它还说在这期间可能会直接裁掉你的岗位。所以这哪是什么岔路口，这分明是‘我们帮你选好了’的单行道。发给200万员工，这不是精简，这是要搞个大型失业真人秀啊！」

[P112] [SPEAKER_06]: 这主意太棒了！我们可以把白宫改造成摄影棚，让总统亲自担任评委。想象一下，国土安全部的员工表演魔术，教育部的员工说脱口秀，财政部的员工表演数钱绝技...这绝对会成为收视率最高的节目！

[P113] [SPEAKER_04]: 而且我们还可以增加一个"复活赛"环节。被裁掉的员工可以通过完成各种奇葩任务来争取复职机会，比如在一小时内用纸杯搭建国会大厦模型，或者用emoji表情写一份完整的政府预算报告。

分析结果：
我觉得这位国家公园管理局的博物馆策展人真是让人佩服。她说她从未考虑过辞职，完全致力于公共服务。这让我想到，公务员这份工作其实挺有意思的，它不像普通工作那样可以随时辞职。你想想，如果一个国家公园的策展人突然辞职了，谁来给游客讲解那些有趣的历史故事？谁来确保游客中心干净整洁？更别提，他们还得负责发放工资和处理税务这些重要事务。

这就像是一个巨大的多米诺骨牌游戏，如果一个人倒下，整个系统都可能崩溃。所以，公务员不仅仅是“铁饭碗”，他们更像是社会的“守护者”。他们的工作可能不像那些高薪的科技公司那样光鲜亮丽，但他们的存在确保了我们的日常生活能够正常运转。

这让我想到，或许我们应该更多地关注和感谢这些默默无闻的公务员。他们可能不会出现在新闻头条，但他们的工作却是我们社会不可或缺的一部分。下次你去国家公园，不妨对那里的工作人员说声谢谢，因为他们正用他们的热情和坚持，守护着我们的公共空间和历史遗产。

我有个朋友特别怕打疫苗，他说疫苗里可能有微芯片，政府想追踪我们。我说：“兄弟，你手机里装的那些App早就把你卖得底朝天了，政府还用得着打疫苗来追踪你？你每天在朋友圈发的定位，比疫苗精准多了。”他想了想，说：“那不一样，App是我自愿装的，疫苗是强制的。”我说：“那你每天刷手机也是自愿的？我看你刷得比打疫苗还勤快。”他沉默了，然后默默地打开了健康码。

特朗普政府要裁员？干脆把政府大楼改造成真人秀场地，让员工们玩"大逃亡"。预算迷宫、政策陷阱、公文障碍赛，谁能成功逃脱就能获得"自由职业者"证书。结果节目收视率爆表，所有参赛员工都成了网红。政府发现裁员省下的钱还不够支付节目制作费用，最后不得不重新雇佣这些员工来管理这个节目。看来，在政府工作最大的挑战不是政策制定，而是如何在真人秀中活下来！

[P119] [SPEAKER_09]: Ideas about the future of memory.
[P120] [SPEAKER_08]: That's on the TED Radio Hour podcast from NPR.

分析结果：
**外来者视角：**

「作为一个外星人，我真的很困惑，你们地球人为什么要用AI来重建记忆？在我们的星球，我们只需要把记忆芯片插进耳朵，就能重现任何场景。不过，看到你们用这么原始的技术来保存珍贵的回忆，我倒是觉得挺可爱的。尤其是当你们看到那些重建的照片时，那种‘就是它！’的表情，简直像是发现了新大陆。」

**学术型视角：**

「从认知科学的角度来看，AI重建记忆的过程实际上是对大脑中模糊记忆的一种‘补全’。当Pau Garcia用AI生成她母亲的照片时，AI其实是在根据她的描述和现有的数据，进行一种‘记忆重构’。这种技术不仅是对过去的再现，更是对记忆本身的一种‘再编码’。有趣的是，当她说‘就是它！’时，其实是她的大脑在确认AI生成的图像是否符合她的记忆模式。」

**童真型视角：**

「我妈妈的照片被AI变出来了！就像魔法一样！AI说：‘嘿，这是你妈妈，她穿着这件衣服，剪了这个发型。’然后我看到了两张照片，我大喊：‘就是它！’就像找到了丢失的玩具一样开心。AI真是太厉害了，它能把我的记忆变成真的照片！」

**受害者视角：**

「作为一张被AI生成的照片，我感到很委屈。我明明是根据Pau Garcia的描述生成的，但她却只对其中两张照片满意。其他的照片呢？我们也是努力生成的啊！难道我们就不配被记住吗？不过，看到她那么开心地指着那两张照片说‘就是它！’，我也只能默默接受这个现实了。」

**旁观者视角：**

「作为一个旁观者，我觉得AI重建记忆这件事挺有意思的。Pau Garcia用AI生成她母亲的照片，然后从几十张照片中挑出了两张，说‘就是它！’。这让我不禁想，记忆到底是什么？是真实的过去，还是我们大脑中的一种‘自我欺骗’？AI在这个过程中，究竟是帮助了我们，还是让我们更加依赖技术来‘记住’过去？」

收到“岔路口”邮件的那一刻，我仿佛看到了推特员工们2022年的集体PTSD。马斯克接手时的那封“岔路口”备忘录，就像是在告诉你：“亲爱的员工，前方有两个选择：要么跟我一起上火星，要么现在就收拾东西回家。”而我们公司这封邮件，标题一模一样，内容却变成了：“亲爱的员工，前方有两个选择：要么继续996，要么现在就收拾东西回家。”看来，“岔路口”这个词在科技公司里，已经成了“你马上就要失业了”的委婉说法。就像你妈说“我们来谈谈”时，你心里已经开始盘算今晚要睡哪个朋友家了。

[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

分析结果：
你知道吗，现在的职场就像在玩俄罗斯轮盘赌，只不过子弹换成了裁员名单。我听说有个司法部的员工，刚入职没多久就被告知“你可能在名单上”。这让我想起我第一份工作，老板说“好好干，前途无量”，结果三个月后公司就倒闭了。看来“前途无量”的意思是“前途无亮”啊。

这些试用期员工现在面临的选择简直是个悖论：要么现在辞职，放弃八个月的工作经验和可能的加薪；要么继续干，最后可能还是被裁。这就像在玩一个必输的游戏，唯一的区别是选择输得早还是输得晚。

最讽刺的是，这些员工还得自己决定要不要“主动退出”，仿佛这是他们的选择似的。这让我想起我朋友说的：“老板说公司要裁员，让我们自愿离职。我说‘我不自愿’，他说‘那你就被自愿了’。”

现在的职场真是越来越像赌场了，只不过赌的不是钱，而是你的职业生涯。而且庄家永远赢，玩家永远输。唯一能做的就是祈祷自己不在“幸运名单”上。

[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.

这种现象其实有一个非常合理的解释：政府高层其实是在进行一场大型的社会实验，测试公务员们的忍耐极限。他们想看看，到底要发多少条“你可以去度假”的通知，才能让员工们意识到，这其实是一个暗示——政府正在转型为“无政府状态”。毕竟，如果所有人都去度假了，那政府自然就运转得更“高效”了，对吧？而且，鼓励大家去私营企业工作，其实是为了让公务员们体验一下“真正的生产力”，好让他们回来时带着新的工作热情和更低的工资预期。这简直是一场精心策划的“职场觉醒”运动，只不过，觉醒的是政府自己——他们终于意识到，或许没有他们，世界也能转得挺好。

[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
收到人事管理办公室的邮件，标题是“岔路口”，警告说大多数机构可能会裁员。这让我想到，政府其实是在玩一个大型的“谁是卧底”游戏。他们发邮件给200万员工，说你可以选择在九月辞职，但在那之前你还能继续领工资和福利。这就像是告诉你，“你可以选择退出游戏，但在你退出之前，我们还可以继续观察你是不是卧底。”而在这期间，他们还可以随时淘汰或重新分配你的位置。这哪是什么“岔路口”，分明是“单行道”——你只能选择退出，而他们却可以随时改变规则。政府说这是为了提高效率，但我觉得他们只是在玩一场更大规模的“裁员版”狼人杀。

The old radio crackled to life, its worn-out speakers struggling to deliver the message. "Support for NPR and the following message come from the Lemelson Foundation," the announcer said, his voice slightly distorted by the static. 

The radio, a relic from the 80s, sat on a cluttered kitchen counter next to a half-empty mug of cold coffee. The mug bore the faded logo of a long-defunct tech company, its once vibrant colors now a muted memory. 

"Working to harness the power of invention and innovation to accelerate climate action and improve lives around the world," the announcer continued, his words competing with the sound of a leaky faucet dripping into a stained porcelain sink.

The radio sighed, "I've been delivering these messages for decades, and yet, here we are, still trying to save the world. When will they ever learn?"

The coffee mug chimed in, "Well, at least they're trying. I've been holding this cold coffee for hours, and no one seems to care about my plight."

The leaky faucet added, "Drip... drip... drip... I've been trying to get someone's attention for weeks. Maybe if I start flooding the kitchen, they'll finally notice me."

The radio, ever the optimist, concluded, "Learn more at lemelson.org. Maybe this time, someone will listen." 

And with that, the kitchen fell silent, save for the persistent drip of the faucet and the faint hum of the refrigerator, both resigned to their fate in a world that often overlooks the small, yet significant, details.

[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
这政府裁员的方式也太魔幻了，发个邮件写“辞职”就算数了？这不就是现代版的“请辞呈”吗？以前是递个折子，现在是发个邮件，科技进步了，官僚主义倒是一点没变。

更搞笑的是，这钱从哪儿来还没着落呢。国会说他们负责发工资，但资金只到三月中旬。这就像你去餐厅点了一桌菜，服务员说“您先吃着，钱的事我们回头再说”。问题是，这“回头”是啥时候？等政府关门大吉的时候吗？

还有这个带薪休假的规定，说是最多10天，但政府又说可以延长。这不就是典型的“规定是死的，人是活的”吗？只不过这次“活的”是政府自己。

最讽刺的是，连律师和工会都在质疑这offer靠不靠谱。这就像你去买房子，中介说“合同您先签着，细节我们慢慢谈”。问题是，这可是政府啊，怎么搞得跟街边小店似的？

所以啊，这哪是什么裁员offer，分明就是一场大型的“我们也不知道该怎么办”的表演。政府用最正式的方式，展现了最不靠谱的一面。这大概就是所谓的“官僚主义的艺术”吧。

And the unemployment rate? It dropped to 4%. But let’s be real—that’s mostly because people got tired of filling out job applications and just started calling themselves ‘freelance influencers.’ So, technically, they’re employed… in their own minds. 

Next month, we’ll report on how many people are now ‘self-employed’ as professional nappers. Spoiler: it’s me. I’m one of them."

从受害者视角（被裁员工）看：
「收到‘岔路口’邮件时，我的第一反应是：这哪是岔路口，这分明是断头路！而且连导航都不给，直接告诉你‘前方无路可走，请自行跳崖’。」

从旁观者（办公室打印机）视角看：
「那天我打印了无数份‘岔路口’邮件，看着人类们拿着它们或哭或笑。要我说，这哪是什么岔路口，分明是十字路口：有人往左走，有人往右走，有人原地转圈，还有人直接躺平。」

[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
收到裁员邮件怎么办？我有个绝妙的解决方案：干脆把辞职信写成一封“反向裁员通知”。内容就写：“鉴于公司目前面临人员过剩的困境，我决定采取主动措施，从即日起正式裁撤本人职位。此举旨在帮助公司实现精简高效的目标，提升整体运营水平。为确保平稳过渡，我将继续履行岗位职责至9月，期间请公司按时发放工资和福利。同时，我保留随时撤销此裁员决定的权利。”这样不仅显得你深明大义，还能把主动权掌握在自己手里，万一公司反悔了，你还可以说：“抱歉，裁员决定已经生效，无法撤销。”——这大概是最体面的被裁方式了。

[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

分析结果：
这让我想到一个荒诞的解释：政府部门的试用期制度其实是一场精心设计的“饥饿游戏”。你看，他们让员工在不确定中煎熬，就像把一群参赛者扔进竞技场，看谁能活到最后。那位司法部的助理律师，她的处境简直就是现代版的“职场大逃杀”。她面临的不是箭矢和陷阱，而是人事部门的“裁员名单”。她如果辞职，就相当于主动退出游戏，失去了宝贵的“生存经验”和可能的“奖金”。但如果她坚持，又可能被“游戏规则”淘汰，空手而归。这种制度的设计者一定是《饥饿游戏》的超级粉丝，他们把小说里的情节搬到了办公室，只是把“生存”换成了“工作”。所以，下次你听到有人抱怨试用期压力大，你可以安慰他们：“别担心，你只是在参加一场没有观众的职场生存秀。”

[P103] [SPEAKER_01]: I love my job.

[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.
[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.

分析结果：
问题：国家公园服务处人手不足，连基本的工资发放和游客中心清洁都成问题。

解决方案：把公园变成一个大富翁游戏。每个游客一进门就得到一张“公园币”，可以用来“购买”清洁任务。打扫厕所赚10公园币，捡垃圾赚5公园币。攒够100公园币可以兑换一张“免排队卡”，下次来不用排队直接进。

执行过程：游客们争相打扫卫生，公园变得一尘不染。清洁工们终于可以专心研究如何用更少的钱买更多的清洁用品。

反转：结果游客们太积极了，连公园的野生动物都开始帮忙捡垃圾。一只熊因为捡了太多瓶子，攒够了公园币，直接兑换了一张“终身免费入园卡”。现在它成了公园的吉祥物，每天在门口迎接游客，顺便检查他们有没有带够垃圾袋。

**解决方案型脱口秀创作：**

问题：政府员工被鼓励辞职去度假或找私企工作，但他们需要养家糊口。

方案：我们可以把整个政府变成一个“度假模拟器”游戏。员工每天上班就是“度假”，完成任务就能获得“假期积分”，积分可以兑换真实的假期或奖金。这样，政府既不用支付额外费用，员工也能在“度假”中完成工作。

执行：每天上班打卡就是“开始度假”，处理文件是“沙滩排球”，开会是“篝火晚会”，写报告是“旅行日记”。每个月根据表现发放“假期积分”，积分可以兑换带薪假期或购物卡。

反转：结果，员工们反而更积极地工作，因为“度假”太有趣了。政府效率提高了，员工满意度也上去了。最后，这个“度假模拟器”还被私企抄袭，成了全国最流行的办公模式。

**段子：**

「政府鼓励我们辞职去度假？我倒是想，但我家的房贷可不会自己度假。于是我们发明了‘度假模拟器’，每天上班就是‘沙滩排球’和‘篝火晚会’。结果，工作效率反而提高了，因为谁不想在‘度假’中多赚点积分呢？现在私企都在抄袭我们的模式，看来我们才是真正的‘度假专家’。」

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - unfamiliar

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
联邦政府裁员这事儿，就像在玩一个巨型俄罗斯方块游戏。特朗普和马斯克这两位“玩家”疯狂地按着下键，想尽快消除那些“冗余方块”。问题是，这些“方块”不是简单的图形，而是活生生的人——有外交官、护士、医生，甚至还有动物学家。

想象一下，动物园里的管理员收到裁员通知时，长颈鹿可能会歪着头问：“哥们，你走了谁给我喂树叶？”而清洁工大叔可能会对着垃圾桶自言自语：“老伙计，以后你得自己照顾自己了。”

最搞笑的是那个“带薪休假”计划，简直就像在说：“亲爱的员工，你被解雇了，但别担心，我们还会继续给你发工资，直到你找到新工作。哦对了，这段时间你可以去度假，或者在家躺着数钱。”

这场景让我想起小时候玩“过家家”，只不过这次“家长”们玩的是“裁员游戏”，而“孩子们”则在担心自己的饭碗。不过话说回来，如果连动物学家都被裁了，那动物园里的企鹅会不会也开始担心自己的“工作保障”呢？毕竟，它们可是“公务员”中最会卖萌的一群啊！

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
这种现象，政府让联邦雇员通过发送主题为“辞职”的电子邮件来接受政府的提议，看似简单，实则背后隐藏着一系列复杂的法律和财务问题。首先，这种提议的合法性就值得怀疑，因为没有先例，而且总统虽然有权力指挥联邦政府机构，但实际支付工资和福利的是国会。现在大多数联邦机构的资金只维持到三月中旬，这就意味着如果国会拨款中断，那些辞职的员工只能在拨款恢复后获得补发工资。更让人困惑的是，不同的联邦机构似乎有不同的条款，这让员工们更加摸不着头脑。

其次，关于联邦雇员在被行政休假状态下的时间限制也是一个问题。根据现行法律，除非有特定原因，否则休假时间不得超过10天。然而，目前还不清楚这种提议中的条件是否被视为可接受的理由。因此，有人担心，支付个人超过10天的行政休假状态可能是未经授权和非法的。尽管人事管理办公室表示，法规可以被解释为允许这种延长的行政休假，但包括就业律师和联邦工会在内的许多人都在质疑这种提议的可信度。

这种现象的唯一合理解释可能是，政府正在尝试一种新的、前所未有的方式来管理联邦雇员，尽管这种方式充满了不确定性和法律风险。或者，更荒诞的解释是，政府其实在测试联邦雇员的耐心和忠诚度，看看他们是否愿意在如此混乱和不确定的情况下继续工作。无论哪种解释，都让人不禁感叹，政府的管理方式真是越来越“创新”了。

主题：联邦雇员对裁员计划的反应 - sincerity

输入内容：
[P48] [SPEAKER_02]: One of those employees works at the National Park Service as a museum curator.
[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

分析结果：
「我在政府部门工作了15年，最近收到一份FAQ，建议我们辞职后可以去度假或者找份私营企业的工作。我当时的反应是：'你们以为我们在这儿上班是为了好玩吗？' 我家里还有老婆孩子要养呢！这份FAQ简直像是AI写的，或者是一个完全不懂我们工作的人编的。说实话，我现在陷入了两难：一边是稳定的工作，一边是越来越大的生活压力。每次看到这份FAQ，我都想笑，但又笑不出来，因为这就是我的真实困境。」

[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.
[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.

分析结果：
「我作为国家公园的策展人，每天都得面对游客的各种奇葩问题。最常被问的就是'这棵树是真的吗？'，我只能微笑着说'是的，这棵活了200年的红杉是纯天然的'。但说实话，有时候我也想反问'您这问题是真的吗？'。不过我还是热爱这份工作，毕竟能在这么美的地方工作，还能每天欣赏到游客们对大自然的天真困惑，这种快乐是无可替代的。虽然工资不高，但至少我不用像其他公务员那样担心发不出工资——因为我们公园的工资是由华盛顿总部发的，而我们的主要任务是确保游客中心的厕所干净整洁。这就是我的公务员生涯，既崇高又接地气，既浪漫又现实。」

输入内容：
[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

分析结果：
问题：这位司法部的实习律师面临着一个两难的选择：要么辞职放弃八个月的工作经验和可能的加薪，要么冒着被裁的风险继续工作。

解决方案：她可以发明一个叫“裁员轮盘”的办公室游戏。每天上班前，所有实习员工都要转动一个轮盘，上面写着“安全”、“危险”和“未知”。转到“安全”的人可以安心工作一天，转到“危险”的人要假装自己已经被裁，而转到“未知”的人则要随机选择一个同事的工位坐下工作。

执行过程：这个游戏很快在办公室流行起来。大家开始互相交换工位，体验不同岗位的工作。主管也被迫参与进来，结果转到了“危险”，不得不假装自己被裁，体验了一把失业的感觉。

反转效果：这个游戏意外地提高了团队凝聚力，大家开始更加珍惜彼此的工作。最终，管理层决定取消裁员计划，因为他们发现每个员工都是不可或缺的。而那位实习律师不仅保住了工作，还因为创意获得了“最佳员工”奖。

You pause, your finger hovering over the screen, and then you see it—the exact image that feels like a time machine. It’s not just a photo; it’s a memory, alive and breathing. You can almost hear her laugh, feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, and smell the faint scent of sunscreen. It’s not just about the past; it’s about how we’ll remember the future. And suddenly, you’re not just looking at a picture—you’re reliving a moment, one that feels as real as the day it happened.

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
联邦政府居然想通过让员工发邮件辞职来解决预算问题？这简直是个天才的逃避方案。他们可能觉得，既然国会不给钱，那就让员工自己辞职，这样就不用发工资了。但问题是，员工辞职后还得给他们发补偿金，这不是把问题往后推吗？更搞笑的是，他们还发明了一个“带薪休假”的新规则，让员工在辞职后还能继续领工资。这就像是你把信用卡账单扔进垃圾桶，然后告诉自己问题解决了。最终，这个“辞职邮件”计划可能只会让政府的财政问题像滚雪球一样越滚越大，而员工们则在这场官僚主义的游戏中晕头转向。

[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.

[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

分析结果：
「在政府工作就像在动物园当饲养员，你每天兢兢业业地照顾动物，结果管理层突然发布了一份FAQ，说：'亲爱的饲养员们，如果你们觉得无聊，可以考虑去马戏团找工作，或者干脆去度假。毕竟，马戏团的狮子跳火圈看起来比我们这里的狮子躺着晒太阳要“高效”得多。' 我心想，难道我们是在这里玩动物大富翁吗？我还有一家老小要养活呢！这份FAQ简直像是ChatGPT写的，或者是某个从没进过动物园的游客的突发奇想。」

[P5] [SPEAKER_02]: The unemployment rate nudged down a tiny bit from December to 4%.

分析结果：
The news anchor adjusted her glasses, the studio lights reflecting off the frames. "The latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the economy added 143,000 jobs in January," she said, her voice steady but with a hint of relief. The teleprompter scrolled smoothly, but she couldn't help but notice the faint smudge of coffee on the corner of the screen. Someone had been in a hurry this morning.

She paused, glancing down at the stack of papers on her desk. The edges were slightly crumpled, and a stray paperclip clung to the top sheet like it was trying to escape. "The unemployment rate nudged down a tiny bit from December to 4%," she continued, her tone softening as if she were personally delivering good news to every viewer at home. 

In the background, a producer whispered into his headset, "Did we double-check those numbers? The last thing we need is another correction email from that guy in Nebraska." The anchor's ear twitched slightly, but she kept her composure, her perfectly manicured nails tapping lightly on the desk as she prepared for the next segment. 

The camera zoomed in slightly, catching the faintest hint of a smile on her lips. "And now, over to Jim for the weather," she said, her voice carrying just the right amount of optimism. The teleprompter paused, and she let out a small, almost imperceptible sigh. "Finally," she thought, "some good news for a change."

分析结果：
在国家公园工作就像是一个永不停歇的时间机器，你不仅要保护历史，还得确保游客中心的地板比他们的记忆还要干净。我们的博物馆馆长说：“我从未想过辞职，因为这里的工作就像是在照顾一个巨大的、会呼吸的博物馆。如果人少了，我们可能连工资都发不出来，更别说让游客看到一尘不染的展品了。” 想象一下，一个没有清洁工的国家公园，那画面就像是一个被遗忘的恐龙骨架，灰尘堆积得比它的历史还要厚重。所以，我们不仅是故事的讲述者，还是那些看不见的守护者，确保每一分税款都能准时回到你的口袋，就像确保每一片落叶都能在秋天准时落下一样。

[P24] [SPEAKER_00]: "Feel the difference with 15% off your first order at bowlinbranch.com with code NPR," he said, his voice rising with excitement, like a child who just discovered a secret stash of candy.

[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: "Exclusions apply," he added, his tone shifting to a more serious note, as if he were a lawyer reading the fine print on a contract. The studio's air conditioning hummed softly, a reminder that even the best deals come with conditions.

[P26] [SPEAKER_00]: "See site for details," he concluded, his voice trailing off like the end of a lullaby. The studio fell silent, save for the faint ticking of the clock on the wall, counting down the seconds until the next segment.

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
「我最近在考虑要不要接受政府的辞职offer，只要发个邮件，主题写上'辞职'就行。听起来很简单对吧？但问题是，我现在连发邮件都要纠结半天——用Gmail还是Outlook？要不要加个表情符号？辞职邮件要不要写'亲爱的'？万一发错了怎么办？我连辞职都这么纠结，难怪我还在做这份工作。」

[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
[旁观者视角]：收到人事管理局的邮件，标题是《岔路口》，内容大概是说政府机构要精简，员工可以选择在九月前辞职，还能继续领工资和福利。这让我想起了超市里那些“最后三天，清仓大甩卖”的广告，只不过这次甩卖的是人，不是商品。政府说这是为了提高效率，但我觉得他们可能只是在为年终奖腾地方。毕竟，当你在裁员邮件里看到“岔路口”这个词时，你知道那不是指两条路，而是指一条路：失业之路。

[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.

### 视角转换型脱口秀段子

**视角：旁观者（地球）**

"你们人类总是担心政府裁员，但你们有没有想过，地球才是最该担心的那个？三百万联邦雇员，每天上下班，制造了多少碳排放？地球可能在想：'特朗普和马斯克，你们终于开始帮我减负了！'不过，地球可能也会有点小失落：'这些人类，以前至少还在为环保局工作，现在连工作都没了，谁来帮我清理垃圾呢？'"

**视角：受害者（被裁员的联邦雇员）**

"特朗普和马斯克说要裁员，我们这些联邦雇员心里都在想：'你们是不是觉得我们太闲了？'但说实话，我们真的很忙！比如，环保局的同事每天都在忙着清理你们丢的垃圾，NASA的同事每天都在忙着研究你们扔的太空垃圾。现在好了，你们把我们裁了，谁来收拾这些烂摊子？"

**视角：学术型（经济学家）**

"从经济学的角度来看，裁员是一种资源配置的优化。但特朗普和马斯克的裁员计划，更像是一场'社会实验'。他们在测试：如果突然减少三百万人的就业，社会会不会崩溃？这就像是在实验室里突然撤掉所有的培养皿，看看细菌会不会自己找到新的生存方式。不过，实验结果可能会让所有人都大吃一惊。"

**视角：童真型（小孩）**

"妈妈说，政府要裁员了，我问：'裁员是什么意思？'妈妈说：'就是有些人要失业了。'我又问：'失业是什么意思？'妈妈说：'就是没有工作了。'我接着问：'那他们是不是可以天天在家玩了？'妈妈笑了，说：'是啊，但他们可能玩不起。'"

**视角：外来者（外星人）**

"我们外星人观察地球很久了，发现你们人类真的很奇怪。你们一边喊着要减少碳排放，一边又让三百万联邦雇员失业，这些人失业后可能会开车到处找工作，碳排放反而增加了。我们外星人都在想：'地球人是不是在玩一种我们不懂的游戏？'"

这些段子通过不同的视角，展现了裁员这一事件的多面性，既有幽默感，又引人深思。

突然，她的手指停了下来。屏幕上的两张照片让她的呼吸一滞。第一张照片里，母亲穿着那件她最喜欢的淡蓝色连衣裙，裙摆微微扬起，仿佛能听到她笑着说：“别拍了，裙子都飞起来了。”第二张照片里，母亲侧着脸，阳光从窗外斜斜地照进来，勾勒出她耳边的几缕白发，那是她最后一次见到母亲时的模样。

Pau的眼泪无声地滑落，滴在键盘上。她轻声说：“妈，我终于找到你了。”电脑屏幕仿佛也在回应她，微微闪烁了一下，像是母亲在轻轻点头。

实验室的角落里，一台老式打印机突然开始工作，发出轻微的嗡嗡声。Pau走过去，拿起刚刚打印出来的照片，指尖轻轻抚过母亲的脸庞。她喃喃自语：“你知道吗？我一直在想，如果那天我没有迟到，如果我能多陪你一会儿，也许……”她的声音哽咽了，照片上的母亲却依然微笑着，仿佛在说：“傻孩子，别自责了，我一直在你心里啊。”

这时，实验室的门被轻轻推开，她的助手探出头来：“Pau，TED Radio Hour的人来了，他们想采访你关于记忆未来的想法。”Pau深吸一口气，擦干眼泪，将照片小心翼翼地放进钱包里，轻声说：“好，我马上来。”

走出实验室前，她回头看了一眼电脑屏幕，母亲的照片依然在那里，微笑着，仿佛在说：“去吧，孩子，去告诉世界，记忆永远不会消失。”

主题：广告插播：ThruLine播客 - techniques

输入内容：
[P121] [SPEAKER_08]: On the ThruLine podcast, the myth linking autism and vaccines was decades in the making and was a major moment for vaccine hesitancy in America, tapping into fears involving the pharmaceutical industry and the federal government.
[P122] [SPEAKER_03]: No matter how many studies you do showing that this is not a problem, it's very hard to unring the bell.
[P123] [SPEAKER_08]: Listen to ThruLine from NPR wherever you get your podcasts.

分析结果：
在昏暗的客厅里，一个中年男子正坐在沙发上，手里紧握着手机。屏幕的光映在他疲惫的脸上，他刚刚听完ThruLine关于疫苗和自闭症的那期播客。茶几上的咖啡早已凉透，旁边散落着几张皱巴巴的纸巾，上面沾满了他的冷汗。

“又是这些阴谋论，”他喃喃自语，手指无意识地敲打着沙发扶手，“可万一呢？万一他们说的都是真的呢？”

他的大脑开始了一场激烈的辩论。理性的一面说：“无数研究都证明了疫苗的安全性，你还要相信那些谣言吗？”而恐惧的一面反驳道：“可那些父母的故事那么真实，他们的孩子接种疫苗后确实出了问题！”

他的胃也开始加入这场对话：“嘿，伙计，我可不舒服了。你这一整天都没好好吃饭，光顾着纠结这些了。”

“闭嘴，胃！”他烦躁地揉了揉太阳穴，“我需要好好想想。”

他的手指在手机屏幕上滑动，打开了社交媒体。铺天盖地的信息向他涌来，有的支持疫苗，有的反对。他感觉自己的大脑快要爆炸了。

“算了，还是去听听ThruLine的其他节目吧，”他最终决定，“至少他们的报道比较客观。”

他站起身，走向厨房，准备给自己倒杯水。路过镜子时，他瞥见自己苍白的脸，不禁苦笑：“看来今晚又要失眠了。”

这让我想起一个朋友，他最近迷上了发明创造。有一天他兴奋地告诉我：“我发明了一种新型太阳能板，可以吸收月光发电！”

我问他：“那效果如何？”

他自豪地说：“蛮当代的。”

“蛮当代的？”我疑惑地问。

“是啊，”他解释道，“白天不工作，晚上效率低，完全符合当代人的工作状态。”

我忍不住笑了：“那你这个发明，应该叫‘月光族太阳能板’。”

他点点头：“没错，我正在申请专利，名字就叫‘蛮当代的太阳能板’。”

“蛮当代的”这个词，就这样成了我们之间的笑点。每次见面，他都会问我：“最近有什么新发明吗？”

我总是回答：“蛮当代的。”

他笑着点头：“那就好，继续保持。”

看来，“蛮当代的”不仅是一种状态，更是一种生活态度。就像那个太阳能板，虽然效率不高，但至少它努力了，不是吗？

分析结果：
在Twitter总部，一个程序员盯着电脑屏幕，手指在键盘上悬停。他的咖啡杯旁边放着两份打印件：一份是2022年马斯克接管时的备忘录，另一份是刚收到的"岔路口"邮件。

"又来了是吧？"他喃喃自语，仿佛在跟电脑对话，"这次是要左转还是右转？"

屏幕上的代码似乎在回应他：「别问我，我只是个无情的机器。」

他拿起咖啡杯，发现咖啡已经凉了，杯底还残留着昨天留下的咖啡渍。办公桌角落里，一只蜘蛛正在织网，仿佛在为即将到来的裁员编织安全网。

"你知道吗，"他对着蜘蛛说，"我觉得我们可能又要经历一次'优化'了。"

蜘蛛停下来，似乎在思考：「至少我还有网可以依靠。」

程序员叹了口气，手指终于落在键盘上，开始更新简历。他的胃突然发出抗议：「嘿，别忘了我，午餐时间到了。」

"好吧，"他对着自己的胃说，"至少在被裁员之前，我们还能享受一顿免费的午餐。"

他站起身，走向餐厅，路过一面镜子时，镜子里的自己似乎在说：「记住，无论发生什么，你都有选择。」

他笑了笑，对着镜子回应：「是啊，至少我可以选择午餐吃什么。」

输入内容：
[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
收到政府裁员邮件就像收到前男友的分手短信，标题都写得特别文艺，什么“人生的十字路口”，其实意思就是“咱们该分手了”。邮件里还说这是为了提高效率，就像前男友说“我们分开是为了彼此更好”。最搞笑的是，它还给你一个缓冲期，工资照发，福利照拿，就像分手后还住在一起，但已经开始在Tinder上划拉新人了。而且它还不忘提醒你，随时可能把你扫地出门，这种既温柔又冷酷的操作，真是把“渣男”二字演绎得淋漓尽致。

输入内容：
[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

分析结果：
作为一个刚入职的联邦雇员，我现在的处境就像在玩一场俄罗斯轮盘赌。每天上班都像是把手枪对准自己的脑袋，然后扣动扳机——不知道今天会不会是“咔哒”一声，还是“砰”的一声。我的主管昨天把我叫到一边，语重心长地说：“你要不要考虑接受那个离职协议？我担心你可能在名单上。”这感觉就像在玩《饥饿游戏》，而我的主管就是那个告诉我“愿机会永远对你有利”的凯特尼斯。

更讽刺的是，我每天都在为这份工作付出努力，就像在给一个即将被拆除的房子刷墙。八个月的工作经验，就像是一张即将过期的彩票——要么中奖，要么一文不值。我和同事每天都在讨论：“我们是该现在就跳下这艘正在下沉的船，还是等它沉到底？”这感觉就像在玩《谁是卧底》，而我们都在猜自己是不是那个卧底。

最后，我决定留下来，不是因为我有信心，而是因为我觉得这就像在看一部悬疑电影——我想知道结局是什么，即使可能会被吓到。毕竟，生活就像一场脱口秀，有时候你只能笑着面对那些荒谬的情节。

我正坐在咖啡馆里，盯着手机屏幕上那个叫WISE的APP发呆。杯子里已经凉透的拿铁表面结了一层薄薄的油脂，像极了那些隐藏在跨国转账中的“隐藏费用”。

“你知道吗？”我对着手机自言自语，“每次我看到‘隐藏费用’这个词，就感觉像被一只无形的手从钱包里偷走了几枚硬币。”

手机屏幕突然亮了起来，仿佛在回应我：“嘿，别把锅都甩给我！我可是能帮你省钱的APP，支持40种货币转换，汇率还按中间价算呢！”

我瞥了一眼窗外，一个背着巨大登山包的外国游客正在ATM机前抓耳挠腮。“看吧，”我指着窗外对手机说，“那哥们儿估计正在被‘隐藏费用’薅羊毛呢。”

手机屏幕闪烁了一下：“那你还不赶紧下载我？我可是你的跨国转账守护神！”

我叹了口气，手指在屏幕上滑动：“好吧，让我看看你的本事。不过先说好，如果让我失望，我就把你扔进这杯冷掉的拿铁里。”

手机立刻弹出一个笑脸表情：“放心，我可是WISE，不是那些只会耍小聪明的普通APP。快打开wise.com，让我带你开启无隐藏费用的跨国转账之旅！”

我无奈地笑了笑，心想这年头连APP都会自我推销了。不过话说回来，能省下那些被“隐藏费用”偷走的钱，这杯冷掉的拿铁似乎也没那么让人沮丧了。

[P15] [SPEAKER_02]: And we talked to some of those government employees about how they've been weighing this critical decision to stay or go.

分析结果：
如果政府的工作机会像限时抢购一样处理会怎样？

想象一下，你正在刷政府工作网站，突然弹出一个倒计时窗口：「联邦职位限时特惠！仅剩3小时！」你赶紧点击申请，却发现需要输入优惠码。你手忙脚乱地翻找邮箱，终于在垃圾邮件里找到了「FED50」这个代码。

提交申请后，系统提示：「恭喜！您已成功抢购一个联邦职位。请在15分钟内完成支付——哦不，是签署合同。」你还没来得及细看条款，又一个弹窗跳出来：「特别提醒：本职位附带免费加班套餐，不可取消。」

更搞笑的是，职位描述里写着：「工作时间：灵活（即随时待命）。福利：自豪感（实物发放，请自取）。晋升机会：视运气而定。」

最绝的是退出机制：「如需离职，请提前30天提交申请，并支付违约金。注意：违约金将根据您的幸福指数动态调整。」

这样一来，政府招聘网站估计得改名叫「联邦职位大卖场」，而HR部门的工作重点就变成了设计各种促销活动：「黑色星期五，所有职位买一送一！」「双十一特惠，前100名签约者送免费咖啡券！」「年终大促，现在签约立享3个月无理由加班！」

想象一下，未来的政府工作报告可能会这样写：「本季度共售出5000个公务员职位，销售额同比增长20%。其中，限时抢购活动贡献了80%的成交量。下一季度，我们将推出'公务员分期付款'计划，让更多人能够负担得起这份'铁饭碗'。」

[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.

Elon Musk坐在特斯拉工厂的休息室里，手里把玩着一个生锈的叉子，眼神飘忽不定。他的大脑正在和火星上的某个外星人进行跨星际对话。

"你知道吗，"他对叉子说，"我刚刚给Twitter发了一封邮件，标题是'叉路口的备忘录'。"

叉子发出一声冷笑："你又在玩什么把戏？"

"我让他们选择：要么跟我一起征服宇宙，要么原地解散。"Elon得意地晃了晃叉子，"结果他们选择了第三条路 - 变成字母X。"

这时，休息室的门被推开了，一群前Twitter员工涌了进来，手里挥舞着法律文件。

"Elon！"领头的员工喊道，"你承诺的遣散费呢？"

Elon看了看叉子，又看了看愤怒的人群，突然灵机一动："别担心，伙计们。我刚刚想到了一个绝妙的主意 - 我们可以用加密货币支付遣散费！我称之为'X币'。"

叉子忍不住插嘴："你确定这不是另一个骗局吗？"

Elon耸了耸肩："谁知道呢？反正我的大脑现在正在和火星人谈判，他们可能会给我们一些外星技术作为补偿。"

员工们面面相觑，其中一个小声嘀咕："我觉得我们可能遇到了比Twitter更疯狂的东西。"

叉子叹了口气："欢迎来到Elon Musk的疯狂世界，在这里，叉子不只是餐具，还是改变世界的工具。"

[P2] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm Darian Woods.
[P3] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm Waylon Wong, and it is Jobs Friday.

分析结果：
The studio smelled faintly of stale coffee and the lingering musk of too many late-night recording sessions. Darian Woods adjusted his headphones, the worn foam pressing against his ears like an old friend. He glanced at the blinking red light of the microphone, its steady rhythm a silent countdown to the start of the show.

"This is The Indicator from Planet Money," Darian said, his voice smooth but with a hint of the exhaustion that comes from too many early mornings. He could hear the faint hum of the air conditioner in the background, a sound that had become as familiar as his own breathing.

"I'm Darian Woods," he continued, his eyes drifting to the stack of notes on the desk. The top sheet had a coffee stain in the shape of a tiny continent, a reminder of the rushed breakfast he had inhaled before heading to the studio.

Across the room, Waylon Wong leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking under his weight. He tapped his pen against the edge of the desk, the rhythm matching the ticking of the clock on the wall. "I'm Waylon Wong," he chimed in, his voice a perfect counterpoint to Darian's. "And it is Jobs Friday."

The phrase hung in the air for a moment, as if the room itself was taking a deep breath before diving into the day's topic. Darian could almost hear the collective groan of listeners everywhere, bracing themselves for yet another discussion of unemployment rates and economic indicators. But for him, it was just another day at the office, another story to tell, another cup of coffee to drink.

输入内容：
[P48] [SPEAKER_02]: One of those employees works at the National Park Service as a museum curator.
[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

分析结果：
### 旁观者视角：
「我是那份FAQ文件，躺在人事管理办公室的打印机上。看着那些员工们愤怒的表情，我心里想：'你们以为我想这么说吗？我也是被逼的！' 如果我能说话，我会告诉他们：'别怪我，我只是个无辜的文档，连个署名都没有。'」

### 学术型视角：
「从组织行为学角度来看，这份FAQ堪称'职场沟通的经典反面教材'。它完美地展示了如何通过一份文件同时实现以下目标：1. 激怒现有员工 2. 打击士气 3. 鼓励人才流失 4. 展现管理层与基层的认知鸿沟。这简直是人力资源管理的'四重奏'。」

### 受害者视角：
「我是那个被建议去度假的员工。当我读到'可以休长假'时，我的银行账户发出了惊恐的尖叫。我的房贷、车贷和孩子的学费纷纷表示：'我们也想度假，但恐怕不行。'」

### 外来者视角：
「作为一个外星观察者，我无法理解地球人的这种管理方式。在我们的星球，如果要让员工离开，我们会直接说：'请离开。' 而不是写一份充满'善意建议'的文件，让员工在愤怒和困惑中自行领悟。」

### 童真型视角：
「如果我是那个写FAQ的人，我会这样写：'亲爱的员工们，你们可以像小鸟一样自由飞翔，去找新的工作啦！或者像小熊一样冬眠，去度个长长的假期！' 这样至少听起来可爱一点，虽然结果还是一样。」

分析结果：
办公室里，小李盯着电脑屏幕，眼睛都快瞪出来了。他刚刚又收到了一封来自IT部门的邮件，主题是：“关于新工作管理平台的使用培训通知”。小李叹了口气，心想：“又来了是吧？这个月第三个平台了。”

他转头看向隔壁工位的老王，老王正对着电脑发呆，屏幕上赫然显示着上一个平台的登录界面，旁边还贴着一张便利贴，上面歪歪扭扭地写着：“密码：123456”。

“老王，你还在用这个啊？”小李忍不住问道。

老王头也不抬：“不然呢？新平台我都登不进去，每次都要找IT，他们忙得跟什么似的，等他们有空，我都退休了。”

这时，小张从茶水间回来，手里端着一杯咖啡，脸上却挂着笑容。

“你笑什么呢？”小李好奇地问。

“我刚在Monday.com上把我负责的项目都整理好了，”小张得意地说，“不用等IT，我自己就能搞定，想怎么改就怎么改，简直不要太爽。”

老王和小李对视一眼，异口同声：“真的假的？”

“真的啊，”小张坐下来，打开电脑，“你看，我刚刚还给自己加了个‘喝咖啡’的任务，完成时间：现在。”

小李凑过去一看，屏幕上果然显示着：“任务：喝咖啡，状态：已完成。”

老王也忍不住凑过来：“这平台不会又是那种用两天就没人用的吧？”

小张摇摇头：“不会，你看我们部门的人都在用，连老板都说好。”

小李和老王对视一眼，心里同时冒出一个念头：“也许，这次真的不一样？”

虽然收到"岔路口"邮件让员工们感到不安，但至少他们提前知道了公司即将面临重大变革，比那些突然被通知裁员的人要好多了。而且，这种邮件标题还挺有文艺气息的，至少比"紧急通知"或者"重要公告"要有创意。再说了，和Twitter员工们同病相怜，至少我们不是唯一经历这种事的，大家一起抱团取暖，说不定还能在社交媒体上找到共鸣呢。从更大的视角来看，这种变革可能反而给了我们重新思考职业规划的机会，说不定能发现更适合自己的发展道路。毕竟，生活就像岔路口，有时候走错了路，反而能看到更美的风景。

[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.
[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.

分析结果：
如果国家公园服务处的工作人员都像这位馆长一样热爱工作，那会发生什么？想象一下，他们不仅会继续讲述故事，还会把每一块石头、每一棵树都赋予生命，让它们成为公园的主角。也许，他们会开始举办“树木脱口秀”，让老橡树讲述它见证的历史，或者让小溪流分享它的旅行日记。而且，如果人手不足，他们可能会发明自动清洁机器人，这些机器人不仅会打扫游客中心，还会用幽默的方式提醒游客：“请把垃圾带走，不然我就要开始讲冷笑话了！”这样的公园，不仅是大自然的宝库，更是欢乐的源泉。

主题：法律专家对裁员计划的质疑 - unfamiliar

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
想象一下，政府发来一封邮件，主题写着“辞职”，就像你收到一条短信写着“分手”，但发件人是你老板。这简直就像在玩“你画我猜”，只不过猜的是你的职业生涯。联邦雇员们现在就像在参加一场奇怪的拍卖会，拍卖品是他们的工作，而货币是“不确定的未来”。  

有人说，这就像你租了一辆车，结果发现油箱是空的，里程表是倒着走的，而你还得付全款。国会说：“钱？哦，我们还没决定从哪儿来呢。” 人事管理局则在一旁淡定地说：“别担心，等我们有钱了，再给你补上。” 这感觉就像你点了一份外卖，店家说：“餐已经做好了，但我们还没找到送餐员，你先等等吧。”  

更搞笑的是，各个联邦机构还各自发了不同的条款，就像你参加一场考试，每个监考老师给的答题卡都不一样。你拿着铅笔，左看看右看看，心里嘀咕：“我到底该填哪个？” 而关于“行政休假”的期限，法律说最多10天，除非有特殊原因。但什么是“特殊原因”？这就像你问老板：“我能请个长假吗？” 老板回答：“看你表现。” 然后你开始琢磨：“我上周的表现算好吗？”  

总之，这场“辞职大戏”就像一场即兴喜剧，演员们（联邦雇员）在台上不知所措，编剧（政府）在后台手忙脚乱，而观众（我们）则一边吃爆米花一边笑：“这剧情也太离谱了吧！”

虽然今天是Jobs Friday，但至少我们不用像找工作那样紧张，可以轻松地听The Indicator，顺便学习点经济知识。而且，Darian和Waylon的声音这么有磁性，至少比听老板的训话舒服多了。再说了，就算今天没找到理想的工作，至少我们还有Planet Money陪伴，比独自面对求职压力强多了。

输入内容：
[P48] [SPEAKER_02]: One of those employees works at the National Park Service as a museum curator.
[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

政府裁员通知就像餐厅服务员告诉你：“你被解雇了，但好消息是你可以去度假，或者去隔壁餐厅找工作。”好像我们辞职就是为了享受生活似的。我心想，是啊，我辞职就是为了带着全家去马尔代夫晒太阳，顺便在沙滩上写简历。这通知写得，简直像是从AI生成的，或者是某个从来没为生活发过愁的富二代写的。

主题：联邦雇员辞职计划的法律争议 - scenario

输入内容：
[P12] [SPEAKER_02]: But is this offer even legal?
[P13] [SPEAKER_02]: Just yesterday, a federal judge paused the offer until at least Monday of next week.
[P14] [SPEAKER_02]: Today on the show, an employment lawyer walks us through the government's deal, which has plunged the federal workforce into confusion and uncertainty.
[P15] [SPEAKER_02]: And we talked to some of those government employees about how they've been weighing this critical decision to stay or go.

分析结果：
Imagine this: it's Monday morning, and federal employees are sitting at their desks, coffee in hand, staring at their inboxes like it's a ticking time bomb. One guy is so confused he's got two windows open—one with the government's offer, the other with a "How to Write a Resignation Letter" tutorial. Meanwhile, his coworker is Googling "Is this even legal?" while nervously glancing over her shoulder, half-expecting a judge to burst through the door with a gavel. Down the hall, another employee is pacing, muttering, "Stay or go? Stay or go?" like it's a life-or-death decision—which, let's be honest, it kind of is. And in the middle of all this chaos, the employment lawyer is calmly explaining the deal on the radio, sounding like the only adult in a room full of panicked toddlers.

[P110] [SPEAKER_06]: But possible byproduct of the Trump administration's designs to thin out the federal workforce is that people may begin to understand firsthand what happens when you gut the federal government.

分析结果：
办公室里，Ricardo正对着电脑屏幕发呆。桌上那杯咖啡已经凉了，杯底还残留着几粒没溶解的糖。他抬头看了眼墙上的时钟，已经下午三点，今天又加班了。

"你知道吗，"他对着隔壁工位的同事说，"我昨天在电梯里听到有人说我们是'政府的累赘'。"他苦笑了一下，"可我们明明每天都在为这个国家拼命工作。"

同事叹了口气，揉了揉酸胀的眼睛。她的桌上堆满了文件，最上面那份还沾着早上不小心洒出来的咖啡渍。"我女儿昨天问我，'妈妈，为什么你总是这么晚回家？'我该怎么回答？说我们在努力让这个国家变得更好，但有些人却觉得我们是多余的？"

这时，办公室的打印机突然发出"咔咔"的响声，仿佛在抗议："我受够了！每天都要打印这么多文件，我的墨盒都快干涸了！"

Ricardo站起身，走到窗边。透过玻璃，他看到楼下街道上熙熙攘攘的人群。"也许，"他自言自语道，"只有当人们真正感受到政府服务缺失的时候，才会明白我们的价值。但到那时，会不会已经太晚了？"

他的胃突然咕咕叫了起来，仿佛在说："嘿，伙计，别忘了吃午饭！"Ricardo这才意识到，自己又错过了午餐时间。他拿起桌上已经冷掉的三明治，咬了一口，心里想着："这个国家需要我们，即使有些人暂时看不到我们的价值。我们会继续坚持下去，因为这就是我们的使命。"

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - what_if

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
What if the federal workforce decided to embrace the Trump administration's offer to quit and collect pay without working, but took it to the extreme? Imagine this: every federal employee, from diplomats to zoologists, accepts the deal simultaneously. Suddenly, the entire government grinds to a halt—no one is answering phones at the IRS, no one is feeding the pandas at the National Zoo, and the custodians have left the White House to collect dust.

Now, picture Elon Musk stepping in to save the day. He announces, "I’ll replace the entire federal workforce with robots!" But here’s the twist: the robots are programmed with the same bureaucratic inefficiency as humans. The IRS bot spends hours debating whether a paperclip is a business expense, the zoo bot accidentally feeds the pandas batteries, and the White House cleaning bot gets stuck in an infinite loop trying to decide if a speck of dust is a national security threat.

By September, the government realizes it’s been paying millions of people to do nothing while Musk’s robots have created a new layer of chaos. The punchline? The federal workforce is rehired, but now they’re just supervising the robots—who are also collecting paychecks for doing nothing. The circle of inefficiency is complete.

[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

分析结果：
从旁观者的角度看，这位司法部实习律师的处境就像是一场精心设计的心理实验：「让我们观察一下人类在不确定性和潜在利益之间的挣扎。」她的主管就像是实验中的变量控制者，一边说「别接受这个提议」，一边又悄悄说「你可能在名单上」。这种矛盾的建议，简直比量子物理还难理解——你既在名单上，又不在名单上，直到你被观察的那一刻才知道结果。

而人事管理办公室的指令更是神来之笔：「请提供所有实习员工的名单，并迅速决定他们是否应该保住工作。」这就像是让厨师列出所有食材，然后决定哪些食材值得继续待在冰箱里。只不过，这次被决定去留的不是胡萝卜，而是活生生的人。

最讽刺的是，这位律师如果现在辞职，就会失去八个月的工作经验；但如果留下，可能会被裁掉，同样失去一切。这就像是在玩俄罗斯轮盘赌，只不过枪里装的是你的职业生涯。难怪她和同事要「思考未来，做出艰难决定」——因为无论怎么选，都像是在选择被哪只脚踩到。

从旁观者的角度看，这场职场生存游戏简直比任何真人秀都精彩。只不过，对参与者来说，这可不是什么娱乐节目，而是真实的人生抉择。正如地球可能不需要人类保护一样，这个系统似乎也不需要保护它的员工——它只是在制造它想要的塑料，哦不，是效率。

[P48] [SPEAKER_02]: One of those employees works at the National Park Service as a museum curator.
[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

分析结果：
What if the Office of Personnel Management’s FAQ was written by a vacation-obsessed AI? 

Imagine this: “Dear employees, we’ve noticed you’re still here. Why? The private sector is calling! Or, better yet, take a six-month vacation. Yes, just pack your bags, leave your responsibilities behind, and go sip piña coladas on a beach. Who needs job security when you can have *sand* security? And don’t worry about your family—they’ll understand. After all, isn’t unemployment the ultimate productivity hack? Remember, the government doesn’t need you, but the world needs more people who’ve mastered the art of napping in hammocks. Bon voyage!” 

It’s like they’re saying, “You’re fired, but make it ✨glamorous✨.”

主题：裁员计划可能带来的负面影响 - bright_side

输入内容：
[P107] [SPEAKER_04]: Critics worry that a hatchet versus scalpel approach to the government workforce will have consequences.
[P108] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says in his experience, the vast majority of federal employees are dedicated to their mission.
[P109] [SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.
[P110] [SPEAKER_06]: But possible byproduct of the Trump administration's designs to thin out the federal workforce is that people may begin to understand firsthand what happens when you gut the federal government.

分析结果：
虽然特朗普政府裁减联邦雇员的做法可能让人感到难过，但这至少能让公众亲身体验一下政府职能的重要性。就像我们常说的，只有失去的时候才知道珍惜。也许经过这次"瘦身"，大家会突然发现，原来那些默默无闻的公务员们一直在背后做了这么多工作。这就像把家里的清洁工辞退了，才发现原来地板不会自己变干净，垃圾不会自己消失。从长远来看，这种"实践教育"可能会让社会对政府工作有更深刻的认识和更高的评价。毕竟，有时候我们需要失去一些东西，才能真正理解它们的价值。

[P103] [SPEAKER_01]: I love my job.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely devoted to being a public servant in the National Park Service, and I'm going to keep telling the stories and doing the work that I believe in until I can't do it anymore.
[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.
[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.

分析结果：
[P107] [SPEAKER_04]: 想象一下，国家公园的游客中心，地板上的脚印越来越多，垃圾箱里的纸杯堆成了小山，而那个总是微笑着递给你地图的志愿者，今天却不在岗位上。因为人手不足，连清洁工都去处理紧急的野生动物事件了。

[P108] [SPEAKER_01]: 我站在公园的入口，手里拿着那份已经皱巴巴的地图，心里却想着那位从未考虑过辞职的博物馆馆长。她就像公园里那棵最老的橡树，根深蒂固，风雨无阻。她的故事，她的坚持，就像公园里的每一块石头，每一片叶子，都在默默诉说着这片土地的历史和未来。

[P109] [SPEAKER_02]: 如果联邦政府失去了这些忠诚的公务员，那么不仅仅是公园的清洁，连我们的税单都可能无人处理。想象一下，你的退税申请像公园里的落叶一样，被风吹得四处飘散，无人问津。

[P110] [SPEAKER_04]: 这些公务员，他们不仅是公园的守护者，更是我们日常生活的守护者。他们的工作，就像公园里的每一盏路灯，照亮了我们前行的道路。如果这些灯熄灭了，我们的世界将会变得多么黑暗。

主题：联邦政府裁员计划的具体实施 - scenario

输入内容：
[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
想象一下，你正坐在办公室里，咖啡还冒着热气，突然电脑屏幕亮起，一封邮件弹了出来。标题是“Fork in the Road”，听起来像是某个哲学讲座的邀请函，但内容却让你心头一紧。邮件里说，大多数机构可能要“瘦身”了，仿佛整个联邦政府都在准备一场集体减肥计划。你一边读，一边不自觉地摸了摸自己的腰围，心里嘀咕：“难道我也要被‘优化’了？”

邮件继续往下滑，像是一场精心设计的“分手协议”。你可以选择在九月辞职，听起来像是给你一个体面的告别。你可以继续领薪水，享受福利，直到那个预定的“分手日”。但别忘了，机构在这期间可能会“重新洗牌”，你的位置可能随时被“抹去”或“重新分配”。你盯着屏幕，心里五味杂陈，仿佛看到自己的办公桌被搬走，椅子被换成了一张更小的。

这封邮件发给了大约200万员工，几乎是整个联邦政府的大多数。你环顾四周，发现同事们都在低头看手机，表情各异，有的皱眉，有的苦笑，有的干脆直接开始更新简历。你突然意识到，这场“Fork in the Road”不是一个人的选择，而是一场集体的“命运交叉口”。你深吸一口气，心里默默祈祷：“希望我选的那条路，不是死胡同。”

[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...

[P5] [SPEAKER_02]: The unemployment rate nudged down a tiny bit from December to 4%.

分析结果：
[P6] [SPEAKER_01]: 143,000 jobs added? That's impressive! But wait, let me check my math...carry the one...divide by pi...yep, that's exactly 143,000 jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics never misses a beat!

[P7] [SPEAKER_01]: And the unemployment rate dropped to 4%? Well, I guess we can all breathe a sigh of relief now that it's nudged down a tiny bit. From 4.1% to 4% - that's a whole 0.1% difference! Let's throw a party for that monumental change! 

[P8] [SPEAKER_01]: In all seriousness though, 143,000 jobs is nothing to scoff at. The economy must be doing something right to add that many jobs in a single month. And while a 0.1% drop in unemployment may seem small, it's still moving in the right direction. 

[P9] [SPEAKER_01]: So let's recap: 143,000 jobs added, unemployment down to 4%. I don't know about you, but I'm feeling pretty good about those numbers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has spoken, and the news is positive. Now if only my own job would give me a raise to match this economic growth!

主题：法律专家对裁员计划的质疑 - perspective

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
[旁观者视角]：这就像是一个奇怪的招聘广告：'诚聘联邦员工，只需在邮件主题写上'辞职'即可。工作内容：在家休息。薪资待遇：照常发放。工作期限：直到我们搞清楚这到底合不合法为止。'

[受害者视角]：我是那个'辞职'按钮，每天被点击无数次，却不知道这些点击会不会让某个人失去工作。我是最无辜的受害者，因为我只是按照程序执行命令，却可能要背负让整个联邦政府瘫痪的罪名。

[学术型视角]：从博弈论的角度来看，这是一个典型的囚徒困境。每个联邦员工都在权衡：是继续工作但可能拿不到工资，还是'辞职'拿钱但可能失去工作？而政府则在赌：是花更多钱让员工'辞职'，还是冒着政府停摆的风险继续僵持？

[外来者视角]：在我来自的星球，辞职意味着结束雇佣关系。但在地球，我发现'辞职'竟然可以成为一种福利！这就像是我们星球上的'休假'，只不过地球人用了一个奇怪的词来称呼它。

[童真型视角]：妈妈说辞职就是不上班了，但为什么这些人辞职了还能拿钱？这就像是我跟妈妈说'我不想去幼儿园了'，然后妈妈却说'好的，你可以在家玩，我还会给你零花钱'。这太奇怪了，我要告诉幼儿园老师！

后来这个家长又说：「那你们得给我孩子治治这个网瘾啊！」
医生：「这个我们真治不了，得找疫苗公司。」
家长：「为什么？」
医生：「因为疫苗公司已经证明了，他们能让人相信任何事。」

（停顿）

现在这个家长又来了，说：「你们得帮我证明疫苗和网瘾没关系！」
医生说：「这个我们真证明不了，因为谣言就像网瘾一样，一旦染上就很难戒掉。」

你看，谣言就是这样，一旦传播开来，就像网瘾一样难以戒除。所以大家要相信科学，不要轻信谣言。

主题：裁员计划可能带来的负面影响 - analogical

输入内容：
[P107] [SPEAKER_04]: Critics worry that a hatchet versus scalpel approach to the government workforce will have consequences.
[P108] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says in his experience, the vast majority of federal employees are dedicated to their mission.
[P109] [SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.
[P110] [SPEAKER_06]: But possible byproduct of the Trump administration's designs to thin out the federal workforce is that people may begin to understand firsthand what happens when you gut the federal government.

「削减政府人员就像修剪盆栽——你以为剪掉多余的枝叶会让它更健康，结果可能连根都拔了。」

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - scenario

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
想象一下，联邦政府大楼里，一个外交官正和一只动物园的考拉面面相觑，旁边站着一位护士，手里还拿着听诊器。突然，办公室的门被推开，Elon Musk大步走进来，手里拿着一份名单，宣布：“各位，今天是我们说再见的日子。” 外交官手里的文件掉在地上，考拉似乎也感觉到了不对劲，紧紧抱住树枝。护士叹了口气，把听诊器挂在脖子上，准备收拾东西。而那位清洁工，正默默地擦着最后一块地板，仿佛在告别这份工作。

与此同时，办公室里弥漫着一种奇怪的气氛，有人已经开始盘算着如何利用这几个月的时间——有人想去环游世界，有人想在家躺平，还有人想试试创业。而那位外交官，已经开始幻想自己坐在沙滩上，手里拿着椰子，对着大海喊：“再见了，华盛顿！”

这种场景，简直就像是一场“政府版”的《最后的晚餐》，只不过这次，大家都拿着离职协议，而不是面包和葡萄酒。

办公室里，打印机突然发出一阵刺耳的噪音，像是它在抗议什么。  
“又卡纸了？”同事小李叹了口气，走过去拍了拍机器，“你今天怎么回事？心情不好？”  
打印机沉默了一会儿，吐出一张纸，上面歪歪扭扭地印着：“你们都要走了，我还印给谁看？”  
小李愣了一下，转头看向坐在角落的老张。老张正盯着电脑屏幕发呆，手里捏着一份文件，上面密密麻麻地写着“自愿离职协议”。  
“老张，你决定了吗？”小李试探着问。  
老张没抬头，只是低声嘟囔：“昨天法官都叫停了，这协议到底算不算数？我要是签了，下个月房贷怎么办？”  
打印机又吐出一张纸：“别问我，我只是个机器。但我觉得，你们比我还卡。”  
小李苦笑了一下，拿起咖啡杯，发现里面已经凉了，杯底还残留着几粒没化开的糖。他盯着杯子，仿佛在问自己：“留下还是走？这杯咖啡都没给我答案。”  
打印机突然又响了，这次吐出的纸上写着：“要不，你们先问问自己的胃？它可比你们诚实。”  
老张终于抬起头，摸了摸自己的肚子，叹了口气：“它说它饿了，但工资单说它得忍着。”  
办公室里一片沉默，只有打印机还在嗡嗡作响，像是在等一个永远不会来的答案。

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
「政府让员工发邮件辞职，就像餐厅让你自己写账单，最后还得自己买单。而且，这账单还可能在某个时候突然失效，你连找谁要钱都不知道。更搞笑的是，他们还说你可以先‘休假’，但休多久呢？10天？还是无限期？这就像餐厅告诉你，你先坐着，我们看看厨房有没有食材，但什么时候上菜，谁也不知道。最后，你可能饿得不行了，还得自己掏钱买外卖。政府的这波操作，真是让人哭笑不得。」

主题：联邦雇员面临的两难抉择 - what_if

输入内容：
[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.

分析结果：
国家公园管理局的博物馆策展人站在游客中心门口，手里拿着一把已经磨损的扫帚，扫帚上的毛都歪向一边。她的制服上别着一枚已经褪色的徽章，那是她十年前入职时得到的。她一边扫地一边自言自语：“你知道吗，这把扫帚比我前任还忠诚。”

她抬头看了看墙上挂着的钟，指针已经停在三点十七分整整两年了。“这钟比我们的预算还准时，”她笑着对路过的一位游客说，“至少它从不罢工。”

突然，她的手机响了，是人事部发来的消息：“紧急通知：由于人手不足，本月的工资可能会延迟发放。”她叹了口气，对着手机说：“好吧，看来我这个月的咖啡又要从‘星巴克’降级到‘速溶’了。”

她继续扫地，心里却在想：“如果连我都走了，谁来给这些老树讲故事？谁来给这些石头写传记？谁来给这些灰尘办展览？”

就在这时，一只松鼠跳到了她的脚边，嘴里叼着一颗松果。她蹲下身，轻声说：“嘿，小家伙，你是不是也想申请加入我们的团队？不过我得提醒你，我们的福利可能还不如你手里的那颗松果。”

她站起身，拍了拍裤子上的灰尘，继续她的工作。她知道，即使工资延迟，即使游客中心的地板永远扫不完，她也会继续留在这里，因为她相信，每一片落叶，每一块石头，都有它们的故事，而她的工作，就是让这些故事被听见。

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
如果政府辞职邮件系统被推向极致会怎样？想象一下，未来的政府辞职流程变成了一场游戏：你只需要在邮件主题栏输入“辞职”，系统就会自动生成一个辞职小游戏。第一关是“预算迷宫”，你需要在国会拨款截止日期前找到资金出口；第二关是“行政假期大冒险”，你要在10天内找到延长假期的合法理由。每通过一关，你的辞职奖金就会增加，但如果你卡在某一关，系统会自动把你转到“困惑热线”，那里有无数个律师在争论这是否合法。最终，你可能会收到一封邮件：“恭喜你，你的辞职请求已被接受，但奖金要等到下一个财政年度才能发放。”这简直就是政府版的“饥饿游戏”，只不过奖品是一张不确定的支票。

"辞职的员工可以在九月前休假？"她喃喃自语，手中的软布不自觉地停了下来。她的目光扫过办公室里其他几位同事，大家都在默默地整理着展品，空气中弥漫着一种说不出的压抑。

"你知道吗，"她对着旁边正在给恐龙化石除尘的同事说，"这FAQ读起来就像是一个从没上过班的人写的。'去度个长假吧'，说得好像我们是在这里度假似的。"

恐龙化石的玻璃展柜上倒映出她疲惫的面容。她想起家里还有两个正在上学的孩子，丈夫的工资根本不够支付房贷。她轻轻叹了口气，继续擦拭着手中的古董，仿佛这样就能擦去心中的焦虑。

"你知道吗，"她对着手中的古董说，"有时候我真希望自己能像你一样，不用为生计发愁，就静静地躺在这里，看着人来人往。"

古董沉默不语，只是在她手中闪烁着微弱的光芒。窗外，一只松鼠跳上了长满杂草的破旧公务车，吱吱叫着，仿佛在嘲笑这个荒谬的局面。

[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...

[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
特朗普上任后，联邦政府大楼里的气氛变得异常紧张。走廊里，一位资深外交官正小心翼翼地擦拭着他那枚"25年服务奖章"，仿佛在擦拭一枚即将被没收的罪证。隔壁办公室里，一位兽医正在给一只政府饲养的濒危物种喂食，嘴里嘟囔着："伙计，你可能比我们还要先失业。"

在人事部门，工作人员正在处理一摞摞的辞职申请。打印机不停地吐着文件，发出"咔嗒咔嗒"的声响，像是在为即将离开的员工们鼓掌。一位清洁工推着吸尘器经过，吸尘器突然发出"呼噜呼噜"的声音，仿佛在说："别担心，我还能再干几年。"

茶水间里，两位护士正在低声交谈。"听说马斯克要来了，"其中一位搅拌着咖啡说，"他会不会把我们也变成机器人？"另一位护士看了看自己的听诊器，开玩笑地说："至少机器人不会抱怨加班费。"

在动物园的办公室里，一位动物学家正在填写辞职申请。他的宠物鹦鹉站在肩头，突然开口："辞职？辞职？"动物学家苦笑着回答："是啊，伙计，连你都要去私营动物园了。"

整个政府大楼里，电话铃声此起彼伏，像是无数个求救信号。一位IT技术人员正在收拾他的工具箱，他的电脑屏幕上显示着最后一条工作日志："系统即将关闭，祝各位好运。"

Twitter is a bird that forgot how to tweet, now it just X's out its problems. If severance packages were promises, then promises are just clouds that never rain. Elon's fork in the road is a spoon digging into a pie chart of chaos. Former employees are now ghosts haunting the X-shaped graveyard of their careers.

[P110] [SPEAKER_06]: But possible byproduct of the Trump administration's designs to thin out the federal workforce is that people may begin to understand firsthand what happens when you gut the federal government.

分析结果：

"亲爱的观众朋友们，你们知道什么是'斧头'式裁员吗？就是不管三七二十一，直接砍掉！但是呢，这种'斧头'式裁员可能会让大家亲身体会到，当联邦政府被'掏空'的时候会发生什么。说到'掏空'，这让我想起了一个笑话..."

（等待观众反应）

"有个联邦雇员抱怨说：'特朗普政府用斧头裁员，我们这些留下来的员工都快被掏空了！' 他的同事安慰道：'别担心，至少你现在理解那些被裁掉的同事的感受了。'"

（停顿一下，微笑）

"看来这种'斧头'式裁员不仅会'掏空'联邦政府，还会让大家'理解'被裁员的滋味。不过话说回来，如果特朗普政府真的用'斧头'裁员，那联邦政府岂不是要变成'斧头帮'了？"

[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
虽然联邦政府正在大幅裁员，但至少这些员工还能在9月份之前领到工资和福利，就当是带薪休假了。而且，现在他们有机会重新规划职业生涯，说不定能找到更适合自己的工作。从更大的视角来看，这可能是推动政府机构精简和效率提升的一个契机。再说了，像动物园管理员这样的职位，也许在私营部门反而有更好的发展前景呢。

分析结果：
[P4] [SPEAKER_04]: Jobs Friday, huh? That's when we all pretend to be excited about unemployment rates while secretly checking our own job security. 

[P5] [SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, Darian. It's like a national holiday for job seekers and HR departments alike. 

[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of jobs, Waylon, remember that time you tried to get a job as a professional sleeper? 

[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, don't remind me! I thought it was the perfect gig—getting paid to do what I love. Turns out, they wanted someone who could actually stay awake during the interview. 

[P8] [SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least you didn't apply for the job of a professional listener. That would have been a real challenge for you, Waylon. 

[P9] [SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'll have you know I'm an excellent listener... when I'm not talking about Jobs Friday, of course. 

[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: Jobs Friday, the day we all pretend to care about the economy while secretly hoping for a three-day weekend. 

[P11] [SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of three-day weekends, Darian, remember that time you tried to convince the boss to make every Friday a half-day? 

[P12] [SPEAKER_04]: How could I forget? I even brought in a PowerPoint presentation titled "Why Darian Deserves More Free Time." 

[P13] [SPEAKER_02]: And what did the boss say? 

[P14] [SPEAKER_04]: He said, "Darian, if you put half as much effort into your actual job as you do into these presentations, you wouldn't need a half-day." 

[P15] [SPEAKER_02]: Ouch. Well, at least you tried. And that's what Jobs Friday is all about—trying, failing, and then trying again. 

[P16] [SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes, just sometimes, succeeding. Like the time I finally got that promotion after years of asking. 

[P17] [SPEAKER_02]: And what did you do to celebrate? 

[P18] [SPEAKER_04]: I took a half-day, of course. 

[P19] [SPEAKER_02]: Jobs Friday, the day we all dream of a better job, a better paycheck, and maybe, just maybe, a better boss.

[P21] [SPEAKER_02]: Right, Darian. Right.

主题：法律专家对裁员计划的质疑 - scenario

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
想象一下，你是一名联邦雇员，正坐在电脑前，盯着屏幕上的邮件，主题栏赫然写着“辞职”二字。你只需点击发送，就能接受政府的提议。这场景就像电影里的情节，但现实却比电影更离奇。你的同事们在办公室里窃窃私语，有人担心这会不会是个陷阱，有人则在计算着能拿到多少补偿。与此同时，华盛顿特区的律师们也在忙碌着，他们翻阅着厚厚的法律条文，试图找出这种前所未见的提议是否合法。你看着日历，三月的日子一天天逼近，资金的截止日期像悬在头顶的达摩克利斯之剑。你心里清楚，如果国会不通过新的拨款法案，你的薪水可能会像断了线的风筝，飘向未知的远方。你想象着自己被置于行政休假的状态，每天无所事事地坐在家里，等待着那笔可能永远不会到来的补偿。这种不确定性让你感到焦虑，就像在玩一场没有规则的游戏，而你手中的牌却越来越少。你开始怀疑，这封邮件是否真的能带来解脱，还是只是另一场混乱的开始。

[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management, its subject line blinking ominously in the inbox like a traffic light stuck on yellow.

[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled "Fork in the Road," a title that conjured images of Robert Frost's poem, though the only woods here were the cubicle farms of federal agencies. The email warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized, its words cutting through the bureaucratic jargon like a machete through overgrown foliage.

[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance, as if the government were a clunky old car in need of a tune-up. The email's tone was almost apologetic, like a mechanic breaking bad news about an engine that's seen better days.

[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoed criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient, a sentiment that hung in the air like the smell of burnt coffee in a break room.

[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal, its words carefully chosen like a used car salesman's pitch. "You can tender your resignation effective in September," it said, the date looming like a storm cloud on the horizon.

[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date, a small comfort in the face of an uncertain future. But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime, a caveat that lingered like a bitter aftertaste.

[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: The "Fork in the Road" memo went out to about 2 million employees, its digital tendrils reaching into inboxes across the country. That's a majority of the federal workforce, a statistic that hung in the air like the weight of a thousand paperclips.

[P45] [SPEAKER_02]: As the email made its rounds, it sparked a flurry of activity in offices and break rooms alike. Workers huddled around computers, their faces illuminated by the glow of their screens as they parsed the memo's implications. The air was thick with speculation, the hum of printers and the clatter of keyboards forming a symphony of uncertainty.

[P46] [SPEAKER_04]: In one corner of the office, a group of employees debated their options, their voices low and urgent. "What do you think they mean by 'reassign'?" one asked, his brow furrowed like a freshly plowed field. "Does that mean we could end up in another department, or worse, another state?"

[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: Another employee, a veteran of the agency, chimed in with a wry smile. "I've seen this before," she said, her voice tinged with the wisdom of experience. "They call it 'streamlining,' but it's really just a fancy word for 'good luck finding a new job.'"

[P48] [SPEAKER_04]: As the day wore on, the memo's impact became increasingly apparent. Some employees began updating their resumes, their fingers flying across keyboards as they tried to distill years of experience into a few bullet points. Others took to the break room, seeking solace in the company of their colleagues and the comfort of stale donuts.

[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: Amidst the chaos, one employee sat quietly at his desk, staring at the memo on his screen. His mind raced with questions, each one more pressing than the last. "What does this mean for my family?" he wondered, his thoughts drifting to his wife and children. "How will we make ends meet if I lose my job?"

[P50] [SPEAKER_04]: As the clock ticked towards the end of the day, the office began to empty out, the employees filing out one by one with the weight of the memo heavy on their shoulders. The "Fork in the Road" had been presented, and now, each employee would have to choose their path, their futures hanging in the balance like a coin toss in slow motion.

[P16] [SPEAKER_01]: 说到 legal 不 legal，让我想起上周我朋友去面试。面试官问他："你觉得加班合法吗？" 我朋友机智地回答："合法是合法，但我不合法。" 面试官当场就愣住了，说："你这是什么意思？" 我朋友说："我的意思是，我这个人不合法加班，因为我一加班就犯困，犯困就出错，出错就不合法。" 面试官听完直接给了他 offer，说："我们需要你这种能把不合法说得这么合法的人才。"

[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: 说到 confusion 和 uncertainty，这让我想起我另一个朋友，他在政府工作。最近他特别困惑，因为他的上司给了他两个选择：要么留下，要么离开。他想了半天，最后决定：既不留下，也不离开。他上司都懵了，问："那你到底想干嘛？" 他说："我想在留下和离开之间找到一个平衡点，就像政府政策一样，永远在 confusion 和 uncertainty 之间徘徊。" 他上司听完直接给他升职了，说："你这种能把 confusion 说得这么 clear 的人才，我们太需要了。"

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - homophonic

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
「特朗普政府推行联邦雇员自愿离职计划，有人问：『这计划靠谱吗？』
答：『当然靠谱，这叫“薪金休假”，简称“薪假”。』
旁人恍然大悟：『原来是“新假”啊！』」

[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.

[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.

收到“岔路口”邮件说联邦机构要裁员？至少你还有时间准备。而且，这可能是你职业生涯的转折点——毕竟，连政府都承认自己“臃肿低效”了，现在离开说不定还能赶上下一波招聘热潮呢。再说了，200万同事陪你一起面对，这种“集体下岗”的体验可不是谁都能有的。最棒的是，在你正式辞职前，工资和福利照发，这不就是带薪找工作的完美机会吗？所以，与其担心被裁，不如想想怎么用这段时间提升自己，说不定下次“岔路口”邮件来的时候，你已经找到了更好的方向。

[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...

办公室里，空气里弥漫着一种压抑的紧张感。这位不愿透露姓名的司法部助理律师坐在她的工位上，手指无意识地敲打着键盘，屏幕上却是一片空白。她的咖啡已经凉了，杯底还残留着一圈褐色的痕迹，像是她此刻混乱心情的写照。

“第一天回来上班的时候，大家都觉得这事不靠谱，”她低声对同事说，声音里带着一丝不安，“感觉怪怪的，像是有什么阴谋。”

她的办公桌上堆满了文件，最上面那份是她的试用期评估报告。她瞥了一眼，心里默默计算着：还有四个月，只要再坚持四个月，她就能转正，拿到那笔期待已久的加薪。但现在，这一切都变得不确定起来。

“你知道吗？”她的同事凑过来，压低声音说，“我听说人事部门已经在列名单了，我们这些试用期的员工都在上面。”

她感觉胃里一阵翻腾，像是有人往里面倒了一瓶冰水。她的手指不自觉地攥紧了咖啡杯，杯壁上凝结的水珠顺着她的手指流下来，像是她此刻的心情，湿漉漉的，无处安放。

“我该怎么办？”她喃喃自语，目光游离在办公室的各个角落。墙上的时钟滴答作响，仿佛在催促她做出决定。她的办公椅发出轻微的吱呀声，像是也在为她感到焦虑。

“如果我辞职，八个月的努力就白费了，”她对同事说，声音里带着一丝哽咽，“但如果我留下来，可能最后还是会被裁掉，什么都没了。”

她的同事叹了口气，拍了拍她的肩膀，“这几天真是疯了，对吧？”

她点点头，目光落在窗外。远处的天空阴沉沉的，像是随时会下一场大雨。她的心里也像是压着一块石头，沉甸甸的，让她喘不过气来。

“我不知道该怎么办，”她低声说，声音几乎被办公室的嘈杂淹没。

她的办公桌抽屉里，还放着一封未寄出的辞职信。她伸手摸了摸那封信，指尖传来一阵冰凉的触感。她的心里一阵纠结，像是被两股力量拉扯着，一边是现实的残酷，一边是未来的不确定。

“这几天，我一直在想我们的未来，”她对同事说，声音里带着一丝疲惫，“但每次想到最后，都觉得像是在走钢丝，一不小心就会掉下去。”

她的同事点点头，目光里满是同情。办公室里，其他人的谈话声此起彼伏，但她的耳边却只剩下自己的心跳声，咚咚咚，像是敲打着她的神经。

“这几天真是疯了，”她重复着，声音里带着一丝无奈。

她的办公桌上，那份试用期评估报告依然静静地躺在那里，像是在等待她的决定。她的手指无意识地敲打着桌面，心里一片混乱。她知道，无论她怎么选择，未来的路都不会轻松。

[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
在华盛顿特区的一家咖啡馆里，Ricardo Pitts-Wiley和他的同事正在讨论这个前所未有的政府提议。咖啡馆的角落里，一台老式咖啡机发出嘶嘶的声音，仿佛也在质疑这个计划的合法性。

他的同事，一位名叫Sarah的律师，忍不住笑了起来。"这简直就像是在玩文字游戏，"她说，"我敢打赌，现在政府大楼的IT部门正在疯狂地处理这些邮件。"

Ricardo点了点头，他的目光落在了窗外的一辆破旧的政府公务车上。"看到那辆车了吗？"他指着窗外说，"杂草都已经长到车窗那么高了。我猜，它可能也在考虑要不要发送那封辞职邮件。"

Sarah顺着他的目光看去，忍不住笑出声来。"你知道吗，"她说，"我刚刚和我的皮肤进行了一场对话。它说：'好吧，看来我们得自己多分泌点油脂了，因为政府似乎已经放弃了我们。'"

Ricardo摇了摇头，他的表情变得严肃起来。"但说真的，"他继续说道，"我最大的担忧是，这些雇员在接受了这个提议后，他们的行政休假状态会持续多久？根据现行法律，这应该不超过10天。但是，如果政府决定延长这个期限，那么谁来支付他们的工资？国会？还是总统自己掏腰包？"

Sarah叹了口气，她的手指无意识地敲打着咖啡杯。"这就像是一场没有剧本的戏剧，"她说，"每个人都在即兴表演，但没有人知道结局会是什么。"

就在这时，咖啡馆的老板走了过来，手里拿着一壶新煮的咖啡。"你们在讨论那个政府提议吗？"他问道，"我刚刚听到我的咖啡机在抱怨：'如果政府雇员都辞职了，谁来喝我的咖啡？'"

Ricardo和Sarah对视一眼，忍不住笑了起来。在这个充满不确定性的时刻，或许只有这些无生命的物体还能保持一丝幽默感。

[P102] [SPEAKER_04]: The other employee we talked to, the museum curator at the National Park Service, said she never considered quitting.
[P103] [SPEAKER_01]: I love my job.
[P104] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely devoted to being a public servant in the National Park Service, and I'm going to keep telling the stories and doing the work that I believe in until I can't do it anymore.
[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.
[P106] [SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, federal employees are custodians and they're also the people who make sure you get your tax refund.

分析结果：
上次见到这么热爱工作的人，还是在《钢铁是怎样炼成的》里。这位国家公园管理局的员工，简直比保尔·柯察金还要敬业，连工资和游客中心都顾不上，也要坚守岗位讲故事。能比这更忠诚的，大概只有《忠犬八公》里的那只狗了。

主题：特朗普政府削减联邦雇员计划 - callback

输入内容：
[P6] [SPEAKER_04]: Since President Trump took office, there is one group of workers whose job security has been in the spotlight, and that is the federal workforce.
[P7] [SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge and varied group that includes diplomats, nurses, doctors, custodians, even zoologists.
[P8] [SPEAKER_02]: As of January, there were about 3 million people employed by the federal government.
[P9] [SPEAKER_04]: The Trump administration wants this number to be a lot smaller, and Elon Musk is leading an unprecedented charge to dramatically shrink the federal workforce, sometimes through brute force actions like basically dismantling entire agencies.
[P10] [SPEAKER_04]: The government also extended an offer for employees to quit their jobs.
[P11] [SPEAKER_04]: Per the terms of the agreement, they'll be able to collect their pay and benefits through September without working.

分析结果：
[P12] [SPEAKER_02]: 这听起来像是一个「联邦雇员大逃亡」计划。不过话说回来，如果连 zoologists（动物学家）都要失业了，那动物园里的动物们岂不是要自己管理自己了？

[P13] [SPEAKER_04]: 没错，而且根据协议，这些「失业」的动物学家们还可以在九月之前继续领工资和福利，不用工作。这让我想起了一句话：「How you doing? - 这次是动物们问的。」

[P14] [SPEAKER_02]: 哈哈，确实蛮当代的。不过，如果连 custodians（清洁工）都要被裁掉，那联邦政府大楼岂不是要变成「蛮当代的」垃圾场了？

[P15] [SPEAKER_04]: 现在你理解我了？特朗普政府这是在玩「加倍奉还」的游戏，只不过这次是「十倍奉还」给联邦雇员们。

[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.

[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

分析结果：
我要向这位司法部员工学习，她成功地用八个月的工作经历证明了一件事：在政府工作就像玩俄罗斯轮盘，只不过子弹是随机分布的，而且你永远不知道下一发会不会打中自己。她的经历告诉我们，在政府部门的职业规划就像在玩一场永远不知道结局的悬疑剧，唯一的确定就是不确定性本身。真是让我们深刻体会到了什么叫“稳定工作”的终极定义。

输入内容：
[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
至少型：「联邦雇员可以通过发送主题为‘辞职’的邮件接受政府提议。虽然这听起来有点奇怪，但至少他们不用亲自去办公室递交辞职信，省去了通勤的麻烦。」

共同型：「联邦雇员对这项提议感到困惑？没关系，连就业律师和工会也在质疑它的合法性。大家都不明白，至少你不是一个人在困惑。」

副产品型：「接受这项提议的联邦雇员将被置于行政休假状态。虽然这听起来不太稳定，但至少他们可以趁机休息一下，享受一段带薪假期。」

全局型：「联邦政府提议雇员通过邮件辞职，虽然这引发了诸多法律和财务问题，但从积极的角度看，至少它推动了远程办公的普及，为未来的工作方式提供了新思路。」

[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
「我要向联邦政府学习，他们真是太贴心了。为了让员工辞职，不仅简化了流程，只需要在邮件主题写上‘辞职’二字，还贴心地安排了带薪休假。这种创新精神，简直是人力资源管理的典范！虽然资金来源不明，休假时间也超出了法定范围，但谁在乎呢？重要的是，他们成功地让员工在困惑中感受到了政府的‘关怀’。」

[P103] [SPEAKER_01]: I love my job.

[P105] [SPEAKER_02]: The same employee told us that if her agency loses a lot of people, it might not have enough workers to administer payroll or clean the visitor center at the national park.

[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

你知道吗，我最近也在为工作焦虑，但我的情况可能比这位司法部的助理还要惨。至少她还有被“列入名单”的资格，而我连被列入名单的机会都没有——因为我的简历已经被自动筛选系统刷掉了三次。看来我的“失业”状态比她的“试用期”还要稳定。不过话说回来，这种不确定性也挺刺激的，每天醒来都像在玩俄罗斯轮盘赌，只是子弹换成了“裁员通知”。

[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
[P48] [SPEAKER_03]: So basically, the government is saying, "Here's a fork in the road - you can take the exit ramp now, or we might just fork you over later."

[P49] [SPEAKER_03]: Either way, it seems like they're determined to streamline things... right down to the last employee standing.

[P50] [SPEAKER_03]: I guess when they said "higher performance," they meant "fewer performers."

[P51] [SPEAKER_03]: And that "Fork in the Road" memo? More like a "Fork Over Your Job" notice.

[P52] [SPEAKER_03]: But hey, at least they're giving people a choice: "You can tender your resignation... or we'll tender it for you."

[P53] [SPEAKER_03]: It's the government's version of "Would you like to jump, or shall we push you?"

[P54] [SPEAKER_03]: Either way, it seems the road ahead is paved with pink slips.

[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?
[P79] [SPEAKER_04]: That would be their status if they accepted the offer to quit.
[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

分析结果：
[P86] [SPEAKER_02]: 所以总结一下，联邦政府这次的提议确实有点...蛮当代的。发个邮件就能辞职？这操作也是蛮当代的。预算只到三月中旬？更是蛮当代的。行政休假超过十天可能违法？简直是蛮当代的巅峰之作。看来联邦政府不仅在政策上创新，在制造混乱方面也是蛮当代的。

输入内容：
[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
上次见到这么大规模的裁员通知，还是在《饥饿游戏》里。只不过这次不是抽签决定命运，而是直接发邮件告诉你：要么自己走，要么等着被裁。看来政府也在玩“瘦身计划”，只是这次瘦的不是腰围，而是工作岗位。

[P88] [SPEAKER_04]: These last couple of weeks have been confusing and anxious for the federal workers we talked to, like this paralegal from the Department of Justice.
[P89] [SPEAKER_04]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P90] [SPEAKER_10]: The first day I was in the office after the offer, the tone was very much like, we're not taking this.
[P91] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems shady.
[P92] [SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird.
[P93] [SPEAKER_10]: And then later that afternoon, my supervisor pulled me aside and was like, hey, you should really consider taking this deal because I'm worried that you might be on the list.
[P94] [SPEAKER_02]: This paralegal is still probationary, and the Office of Personal Management recently ordered department heads to provide a list of all their probationary employees.
[P95] [SPEAKER_02]: They were also asked to, quote, promptly determine whether those employees should keep their jobs.
[P96] [SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice employee told us if she quits, she'll be giving up eight months of valuable work experience, plus a potential pay bump if she successfully completes her probationary period.
[P97] [SPEAKER_04]: But if she stays, she might get cut anyway and leave with nothing.
[P98] [SPEAKER_04]: She's been agonizing over the decision with a colleague in a similar situation.
[P99] [SPEAKER_10]: So the last couple of days, like, you know, thinking about our future and making some hard decisions.
[P100] [SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know any...
[P101] [SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, over the course of a few days, it's been really insane.

分析结果：
如果工作是一棵树，那么树叶是工资，树枝是经验，树干是未来。但风一吹，树叶会掉，树枝会断，树干会倒。所以为什么不把树种在温室里？温室里有阳光，有水分，有温暖，但没有风。这样树叶不会掉，树枝不会断，树干不会倒。但温室里的树，真的是一棵树吗？

And let's not forget the classic move: keep paying them until September, but hey, we might fire you before then anyway. Real classy. Two million employees getting this memo?

[P80] [SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo says that under an existing law, leave is capped at 10 days unless there is a specific reason.
[P81] [SPEAKER_04]: And he's not sure what's laid out in the offer counts as an accepted reason.
[P82] [SPEAKER_06]: So there's concern that...
[P83] [SPEAKER_06]: Paying individuals to be in a paid administrative leave status beyond 10 days is unauthorized and illegal.
[P84] [SPEAKER_04]: The Office of Personnel Management, for its part, says regulations can be interpreted to allow this kind of extended administrative leave.
[P85] [SPEAKER_04]: Still, Ricardo is among a chorus of employment attorneys, not to mention federal worker unions, who are questioning whether the offer can be trusted.

[P38] [SPEAKER_02]: The first email arrived last week from the Office of Personnel Management.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: It was entitled Fork in the Road, and it warned that most agencies were likely to be downsized.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: The office said a more streamlined federal workforce is part of a broader goal of higher performance.
[P41] [SPEAKER_02]: This echoes criticisms of the government that it can be bloated and inefficient.
[P42] [SPEAKER_04]: The email went on to offer federal employees a deal.
[P43] [SPEAKER_04]: You can tender your resignation effective in September.
[P44] [SPEAKER_04]: Workers would keep earning their salary and benefits until their resignation date.
[P45] [SPEAKER_04]: But it also said that agencies could eliminate or reassign positions in the meantime.
[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: The Fork in the Road memo went out to about 2 million employees.
[P47] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a majority of the federal workforce.

分析结果：
"联邦政府说要精简机构提高效率，还给了员工一个选择：要么9月主动辞职，要么等着被裁。这就像你妈跟你说：'要么自己把房间收拾了，要么我帮你收拾'。但问题是，你妈帮你收拾的时候，可能会把你最喜欢的玩具也一起收拾掉。"

[P61] [SPEAKER_04]: Federal employees could accept the government offer by sending an email with the word resign in the subject line.
[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: This is one of many unusual parts of this deal.
[P63] [SPEAKER_04]: That's according to Ricardo Pitts-Wiley.
[P64] [SPEAKER_04]: He's a partner at a Washington, D.C.
[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: law firm called Federal Practice Group, and he specializes in federal employment law.
[P66] [SPEAKER_06]: I just had a litany of questions about whether the administration was authorized to provide this kind of offer.
[P67] [SPEAKER_06]: I was concerned about whether it could be legally implemented.
[P68] [SPEAKER_06]: There is no precedent for this kind of offer.
[P69] [SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about two of Ricardo's litany of questions.
[P70] [SPEAKER_02]: Number one, where is the money for paying out wages and benefits going to come from?
[P71] [SPEAKER_06]: The president has the authority to direct the federal government agencies, but it is Congress that pays these individuals.
[P72] [SPEAKER_04]: And right now, most of these federal agencies are only funded through mid-March.
[P73] [SPEAKER_04]: That's when the current funding bill for the government expires.
[P74] [SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Personnel Management does acknowledge this deadline.
[P75] [SPEAKER_02]: It says that if there's a lapse in congressional appropriations, employees that resign will receive back pay when that lapse is over.
[P76] [SPEAKER_02]: It is worth mentioning, though, that some federal agencies have sent out their own terms that seem different than what the Office of Personnel Management is saying.
[P77] [SPEAKER_02]: This has added to the confusion for workers.
[P78] [SPEAKER_04]: Now, the second of Ricardo's concerns is how long can federal employees be placed under administrative leave?

分析结果：
"联邦政府给员工发邮件说只要在主题栏写‘辞职’就能接受政府提议，这让我想起一个笑话：政府说‘辞职就能拿钱’，员工们纷纷回复‘辞职’，结果政府说‘抱歉，我们只是在测试你们的忠诚度’。看来这次是真的，但员工们可能在想：这到底是测试忠诚度，还是测试我们的智商？"

[P48] [SPEAKER_02]: One of those employees works at the National Park Service as a museum curator.
[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.
[P58] [SPEAKER_01]: It almost seemed like it was written by AI or someone just completely out of touch with what we're doing.

分析结果：
[P59] [SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of being out of touch, remember that museum curator who wanted to protect her job security? Turns out, she's now considering a long vacation... or maybe a private sector job. 

[P60] [SPEAKER_04]: I guess the FAQ really resonated with her. 

[P61] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but let's not forget - she still has a family to support. So, how do you think she's just doing this for fun? 

[P62] [SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the FAQ was written by AI after all. 

[P63] [SPEAKER_02]: Or someone completely out of touch with what we're doing. 

[P64] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it. 

[P65] [SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least now we know - whether it's a museum curator or any other employee, the message from the top is clear: they really wish we would leave. 

[P66] [SPEAKER_02]: And take a long vacation. 

[P67] [SPEAKER_01]: Or find a more productive job in the private sector.

上次见到这么离谱的职场建议，还是在《皇帝的新装》里。能比这份FAQ更脱离现实的，大概就只有童话故事了。自从有了这份建议以来，最想度假的恐怕是写这份FAQ的人自己。

[P48] [SPEAKER_02]: One of those employees works at the National Park Service as a museum curator.
[P49] [SPEAKER_02]: She asked that we not use her name to protect her job security.
[P50] [SPEAKER_01]: In my 15 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[P51] [SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was clear that, you know, the people at the top were showing us they really wished we would leave.
[P52] [SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after, the Office of Personnel Management published an FAQ.
[P53] [SPEAKER_04]: It said employees who resign are not expected to work between now and September, that they could take a vacation.
[P54] [SPEAKER_04]: The FAQ also encouraged workers to find a job outside of the government, while implying that private sector jobs are more productive than public ones.
[P55] [SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned how we could take a job in the private sector or how we could go on a long vacation.
[P56] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, how do you think we're just doing this for fun?
[P57] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a family to support.

"Ah, the classic 'take a vacation or find a private sector job' advice. Because, you know, we all just work for the thrill of it, not to, say, pay bills or anything mundane like that. Guess the FAQ writer missed the memo on reality."

The museum curator is a time traveler, carefully curating artifacts from the future. Her anonymity is a cloak woven from the threads of job security and invisibility. 

In the grand tapestry of bureaucracy, the people at the top are merely puppets dangling from the strings of their own ambitions. Their wish for departure is a silent scream echoing through the corridors of power.

The FAQ is a cryptic scroll, its words dancing like fireflies in the night. Resignation becomes a gateway to a summer of endless possibilities, where vacations stretch like rubber bands and private sector jobs bloom like flowers in a field.

The family is an anchor, grounding the soul in a sea of uncertainty. The AI, or perhaps the out-of-touch scribe, is a mirror reflecting the disconnect between the world of words and the world of reality. 

In the end, it is all a cosmic joke, a riddle wrapped in an enigma, floating in the vastness of the universe.

主题：市场情绪与资金流动 - attitude

输入内容：
[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
我觉得投资市场就像一个大型的心理治疗室，每个人都带着自己的恐惧和焦虑来寻求安慰。你知道吗？每次市场一波动，人们就像受惊的小鹿一样，纷纷逃向现金的怀抱。这让我想起我那个总是把现金藏在床底下的奶奶，她说这样最安全，但每次通货膨胀，她的钱就像被老鼠啃了一样慢慢缩水。

现在的情况也差不多，人们把钱锁在货币市场基金里，以为这样就能高枕无忧。但问题是，这些钱就像被关在笼子里的鸟，迟早要飞出来寻找更高的回报。而且，随着利率的波动，这些基金也变得不那么吸引人了。投资者们开始打电话抱怨，说他们的GIC到期了，新利率让他们不满意。这让我想起那些在餐厅里抱怨菜太咸的顾客，最后还不是得吃下去？

说到底，投资市场就是一个不断循环的过程：恐惧、逃离、回归、再恐惧。就像我那个总是担心世界末日的朋友，每次危机一过，他又开始乐观地买股票。所以，别太担心那些暂时逃离市场的资金，它们迟早会回来的，就像我那个总是迷路但最终总能找到回家的路的狗一样。

你知道吗，投资公司发季度通讯其实是个特别巧妙的心理战术。就像你去餐厅，服务员总是先给你推荐他们已经准备好的菜品，而不是正在烹饪的。这背后的逻辑是：他们已经投资的公司就像已经上桌的菜，不管好不好吃，反正已经有人买单了。而那些“即将投资”的公司，就像后厨正在炒的菜，谁知道会不会糊呢？所以，他们的通讯就像餐厅的菜单，展示的都是“已经验证过”的菜品，让你觉得：“哇，这些菜肯定不错，毕竟已经有人吃过了！”但实际上，他们只是在用已经成功的案例来吸引你，让你忽略那些可能还在“试验阶段”的投资。这就像是在说：“我们已经吃过了，味道不错，你们也来尝尝吧！”但别忘了，他们吃的是免费的试吃，而你，可是要付全款的。

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
我觉得AI这个话题特别有趣，因为它让我想起了一个很蠢的现象。现在很多人都在吹捧AI，好像它是什么神奇的万能药。但实际情况是，大多数公司用AI的方式就像给一辆自行车装上了火箭发动机，结果发现骑起来更费劲了。

你看，有些公司把AI当成了救命稻草，以为只要用上AI就能一夜暴富。但事实是，他们连自己的业务流程都搞不清楚，就想用AI来解决问题。这就像是一个连自行车都骑不好的人，突然说要参加环法自行车赛，还非得用火箭发动机。结果可想而知，不仅没赢比赛，还把自行车给炸了。

我觉得这种现象特别可笑，因为它暴露了很多人对技术的盲目崇拜。他们以为AI是万能的，却忽略了最基本的业务逻辑。这就像是一个人买了一台超级计算机，却只用它来玩扫雷游戏。你说这是不是太蠢了？

所以，我觉得AI的真正价值不在于它有多先进，而在于它能不能解决实际问题。如果一家公司连自己的业务流程都搞不清楚，那么再先进的AI也只是个摆设。这就像是一辆自行车，无论你给它装上多先进的发动机，如果骑手不会骑车，那它还是一辆废铁。

总之，我觉得AI是个好东西，但要用对地方。否则，它只会成为一场昂贵的闹剧。

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.

分析结果：
问题：如何让投资者对我们的投资策略产生兴趣，但又不想透露即将投资的公司？

方案：我们创造了一个“事后诸葛亮”的新闻通讯。我们不会告诉你我们明天要投资的公司，但一旦我们投资了，我们会详细分享我们的发现和见解。这样，我们既保护了我们的投资策略，又让投资者有机会了解我们的投资思路。

执行：我们定期发布新闻通讯，里面充满了我们对市场的独特见解和那些不那么为人所知但极具潜力的公司。我们让投资者看到，虽然我们已经从中获利，但这些公司仍有巨大的上升空间。

反转：结果，我们的新闻通讯不仅没有泄露我们的投资策略，反而成了投资者了解我们的最佳途径。他们喜欢这种“事后诸葛亮”的视角，因为它不仅提供了新鲜的市场观点，还让他们发现了许多之前未曾注意到的有趣公司。

幽默点：我们就像是投资界的“剧透党”，总是在你还没看剧之前就告诉你结局，但你还是忍不住想看看我们是怎么发现的。

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
每次市场崩盘后，投资者就像受惊的小鹿一样，把资金全撤到货币市场基金里。这让我想起我那个特别怕死的老爸，每次看到股市下跌，就立刻把退休金全取出来藏在床底下。他说这叫“安全第一”，我说这叫“错过机会”。

但有趣的是，这种恐慌性撤离总是暂时的。就像我老爸，每次藏钱不到三个月就开始后悔，因为发现床底下太潮湿，钱都发霉了。投资者也是一样，当利率下降，或者觉得世界没那么可怕了，就会慢慢把钱重新投入市场。

这个过程就像谈恋爱，刚开始失恋的时候，发誓再也不相信爱情了，觉得单身最安全。但过不了多久，看到别人秀恩爱，又开始蠢蠢欲动。投资者也是这样，看着别人在股市里赚钱，自己那点可怜的利息，就开始心痒难耐。

所以说，市场就像一个巨大的心理治疗室，帮助投资者克服恐惧，重拾信心。只是这个治疗过程有点慢，就像我老爸，到现在还在纠结要不要把钱从床底下拿出来。

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
我觉得投资市场的波动特别可怕，尤其是当你以为自己已经掌握了所有规律，结果市场突然给你来个180度大转弯。就像Donville Kent资产管理公司，他们在2008年和2020年两次市场大跌中都挺过来了，结果2021年到2023年又遇到了麻烦。这让我想起了一个笑话：投资市场就像是一个永远在变化的女朋友，你以为你已经了解她了，结果她突然就变了个样，让你措手不及。

我觉得这种时候，投资者就像是在玩一场永远没有终点的马拉松，你得有足够的耐心和韧性，才能不被市场的波动打垮。就像Jason和Jesse说的，利率的突然上涨让他们措手不及，但他们还是坚持了自己的策略，最终等到了市场的认可。这让我觉得，投资不仅仅是对市场的理解，更是对自己心态的考验。你得有足够的耐心，才能在市场的波动中保持冷静，不被短期的得失所左右。

所以，我觉得投资市场就像是一场心理战，你得有足够的耐心和韧性，才能在这场没有终点的马拉松中坚持下来。就像Donville Kent资产管理公司一样，他们在市场的波动中保持了冷静，最终等到了市场的认可。这让我觉得，投资不仅仅是对市场的理解，更是对自己心态的考验。你得有足够的耐心，才能在市场的波动中保持冷静，不被短期的得失所左右。

[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are

[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.

「最近大家都在讨论AI，说它能让企业效率提升。我觉得这就像给公司请了个全能助理，既能写代码又能做PPT，还不用交社保。但问题是，现在很多企业用AI就像让小学生用计算器——他们连题都不会出，光有个计算器有什么用？而且我发现，那些真正靠AI发大财的公司，都是原本就很有钱的大企业。这就好比说健身房的私教课能让你变瘦，但前提是你得先有钱买课。最讽刺的是，AI越发达，我们普通人越焦虑。以前担心被同事卷，现在担心被AI取代。这让我想起一个笑话：老板说要用AI提高效率，结果第一个被优化的就是HR，因为AI招人更快。但问题是，AI招来的员工会不会也被AI取代？这就形成了一个完美的闭环：AI招AI，AI管AI，最后整个公司就剩一个CEO在办公室里对着电脑发呆。」

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.

[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
「我最近在研究股票投资，发现一个有趣的现象。专家们都在讨论什么'40法则'，说一个公司的估值超过40倍市盈率就太离谱了。但现在的市场，35倍都算正常，25倍反而显得保守了。这让我想起我老婆买包，原价觉得贵，打折后觉得划算，其实还是那个包，只是我们的心理预期变了。投资和买包一样，都是数字游戏，只不过一个是市盈率，一个是折扣率。」

「还有专家说，75%的高回报股票都来自科技行业。这就像我儿子报兴趣班，钢琴、绘画、编程，最后发现编程班最贵，但也最有'钱途'。看来不管是投资还是教育，大家都认准了科技这条赛道。只是不知道，等这些科技公司都长大了，会不会也像我们这些中年人一样，开始为脱发和失眠发愁。」

「最有趣的是，专家们选择股票还要看管理团队，说要'相处舒服'。这让我想起相亲，对方条件再好，聊不来也是白搭。看来选股票和找对象一样，既要看硬实力，也要看眼缘。只是不知道，如果股票表现不好，能不能像相亲对象一样，直接拉黑不联系。」

分析结果：
我觉得投资这件事特别像谈恋爱，你得有足够的耐心和韧性，因为你永远不知道市场什么时候会给你来一记重拳。就像2022年，利率突然飙升，我们完全措手不及，简直被市场打得鼻青脸肿。但你知道吗？这反而让我觉得投资特别有趣，因为它总是在考验你的承受能力。就像有人说的，投资经理就像市场的沙袋，时不时就得挨几下。但正是这种时候，才能真正看出一个人的韧性。我觉得，能在这种打击下依然保持高水平的投资表现，才是真正的投资高手。所以，下次市场再给你来一记重拳，别急着喊疼，先想想怎么反击吧！

而且我发现一个有趣的现象，75%的十倍股都来自科技行业。这让我不禁怀疑，是不是科技公司都自带“十倍滤镜”？就像那些网红照片，明明现实中是路人甲，加了滤镜就成了明星脸。科技股也是一样，加个“颠覆性创新”的滤镜，估值就能翻十倍。

不过话说回来，投资科技股最让我困惑的是，为什么那些真正改变世界的公司，比如发明了Wi-Fi的CSIRO，股价却一直不温不火？而那些号称要“改变世界”的初创公司，却能在IPO当天就市值翻倍？这让我想起一句话：“真正的高手往往在民间，而真正的高手股往往在别人手里。”

所以我现在的投资策略就是：看到科技股就买，买完就忘。因为我知道，只要我忘得够久，说不定哪天就能在新闻上看到“你十五年前买的股票现在值一千万”的惊喜。这大概就是所谓的“被动投资”吧——被动地等待惊喜，被动地接受现实，被动地成为一个“科技股专家”。

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
**现象层**：每当经济危机爆发，人们总是争先恐后地把钱从股市撤出，转而投入货币市场基金，仿佛这些基金是金融界的诺亚方舟。这种现象在2000年互联网泡沫破裂和2008年金融危机后都曾上演。

**态度层**：这种行为看似明智，实则令人困惑。人们似乎在危机中寻找一种虚假的安全感，而忽视了长期投资的潜力。

**逻辑层**：当市场动荡时，恐惧驱使人们逃离股市，寻求现金的庇护。然而，这种“避险”行为往往伴随着锁定期的限制，资金被冻结，无法灵活应对市场变化。随着利率上升，货币市场基金的吸引力增加，但这也意味着投资者错过了股市潜在的更高回报。

**解释层**：其实，人们把钱投入货币市场基金，并不是因为他们真的相信这些基金能带来更好的回报，而是因为他们需要一个心理安慰剂。就像在暴风雨中，人们会紧紧抓住任何看起来稳固的东西，即使那只是一根稻草。货币市场基金就是那根稻草，让人们在金融风暴中感到一丝安心。然而，随着时间的推移，当风暴过去，人们逐渐恢复信心，这些资金又会慢慢回流到股市，完成一场“慢速放血”的金融迁徙。

**总结**：货币市场基金的高涨，不过是人们在不确定性中寻求安全感的心理映射。真正的投资智慧，在于在风暴中保持冷静，看到长远的机遇，而不是被短期的恐惧所左右。

分析结果：
你知道吗，为什么科技公司总是能成为投资界的宠儿？我觉得唯一合理的解释是，他们其实在玩一个巨大的“模拟经营”游戏。你看，传统企业还在用Excel表格做预测，科技公司已经用AI模拟了未来100年的市场走势。他们不是在做生意，他们是在玩《模拟人生：商业版》。每次我们投资科技公司，其实就是在给他们充值游戏币，让他们能买更多的“AI外挂”。而他们回报给我们的，就是那些看起来像科幻小说一样的增长曲线。这就像你小时候玩《大富翁》，你永远不知道下一轮会不会抽到“直接升到最高级”的幸运卡。只不过现在，这张幸运卡叫“人工智能”。

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.

[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
为什么科技公司总是估值高得离谱？这其实是因为我们生活在一个“数字崇拜”的时代。就像古代人崇拜太阳神一样，现代人崇拜“代码神”。你看，科技公司的估值就像是信徒们给神像献上的供品，越多越显得虔诚。而且，科技公司的产品我们看不见摸不着，就像神迹一样神秘，神秘的东西自然就更值钱。所以，当一家科技公司说“我们的估值是35倍市盈率”时，其实是在说“我们的信仰值35倍”。而那些传统行业，比如制造业，就像是在卖实实在在的贡品，谁还会给贡品定高价呢？所以，科技公司的高估值，本质上是一场现代版的数字崇拜仪式。

输入内容：
[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
投资市场就像一场马拉松，不是看谁跑得快，而是看谁能坚持到最后。Donville Kent资产管理公司能在2008年和2020年两次市场暴跌中挺过来，这让我想起了一个有趣的比喻：他们就像是投资界的“不倒翁”，市场越打他们，他们反而站得更稳。

这让我想到了生活中的一个现象：我们总是羡慕那些在股市里赚大钱的人，却忽略了他们背后承受的压力。就像我们只看到体操运动员在平衡木上的优雅，却不知道他们摔了多少次。Donville Kent的经历告诉我们，投资成功的关键不是预测市场的每一次波动，而是在市场把你打趴下时，你还能站起来继续前进。

有趣的是，他们在2021到2023年的困境中，最大的挑战竟然是利率的突然上涨。这让我想起了我那个总是抱怨房贷利率上涨的朋友，他说：“利率涨得比我工资还快，这哪是投资，这是在玩心跳啊！”看来，无论是个人理财还是专业投资，利率都是那个让人又爱又恨的“老朋友”。

说到底，投资就像人生，最重要的不是你能跑多快，而是你能走多远。Donville Kent的故事告诉我们，真正的投资高手，不是那些总是猜对市场的人，而是那些在市场打脸时，还能保持微笑的人。毕竟，在投资这场马拉松中，最后的赢家往往是那些最有韧性的人，而不是最聪明的人。

[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.

分析结果：
投资就像谈恋爱，有时候你得学会放手。你看Constellation Software，就像那个你深爱了15年的初恋，从20块一路涨到让你笑得合不拢嘴。但是当它开始分家产，把Lumine和Topicus分出去的时候，你就得好好想想了。

就像我朋友说的，他还在追那两个分家出去的孩子，但我已经看开了。首先，估值太高了，30倍市盈率，这不是在买股票，这是在买梦想。其次，管理团队不熟悉，就像突然要你去跟陌生人相亲，总觉得少了点安全感。

但话说回来，科技股确实是投资界的“金凤凰”。美国那边75%的十倍股都来自科技行业，加拿大也是如出一辙。这就像找对象，大家都喜欢那些有潜力、能快速成长的，谁不想找个“潜力股”呢？

所以，投资和谈恋爱一样，既要懂得坚持，也要学会放手。有时候，最明智的选择就是继续守着那个你了解、信任的“老情人”，而不是盲目追求那些看起来光鲜亮丽的新面孔。毕竟，稳扎稳打，才能笑到最后。

但这就是投资的魅力所在，不是吗？你得有韧性，得像块橡皮筋，被拉得再长也能弹回来。市场就像是个拳击手，时不时给你几拳，但你不能倒下，得站起来继续战斗。我们经历了两次大的回撤，但每次都能重新站起来，继续前行。这不仅仅是因为我们有策略，更是因为我们有那种“打不死的小强”精神。

说到仓位管理，这就像是做饭，你不能把所有调料都一次性倒进去。我们喜欢集中投资，但也不是盲目地大笔投入。进入一个高确信度的仓位，就像是慢慢炖一锅好汤，得小火慢炖，时不时尝尝味道，调整火候。你不能一下子把所有资本都压上去，那样的话，一旦火候不对，整锅汤就毁了。

所以，投资不仅仅是数字游戏，更是一场心理战。你得有韧性，有策略，还得有耐心。就像是在玩扑克，你得知道什么时候该加注，什么时候该弃牌。市场总是充满不确定性，但正是这些不确定性，才让投资变得如此有趣和充满挑战。

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
说到AI，我就想起我那个创业失败的哥们。他开发了一个AI助手，专门帮人写段子。结果他自己用这个助手写段子的时候，助手说：“你的笑话比我的算法还冷。”这让他陷入了深深的自我怀疑——到底是他的段子太烂，还是AI太诚实？最后他得出结论：可能两者都有。这大概就是AI带来的效率提升吧，连打击人都这么精准高效。

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
我觉得投资决策这件事特别有意思，尤其是那些所谓的“高确信度”投资。你知道吗，这就像相亲一样，你以为找到了真爱，结果发现对方是个“高确信度”的骗子。投资经理们总是说：“我们不会轻易进入一个高确信度的仓位。”但我觉得，这就像相亲时说：“我们不会轻易进入一段高确信度的关系。”结果呢？还是会被坑得血本无归。

还有那些卖出的理由，比如“估值变得离谱”。这让我想起了我前男友，他一开始估值还挺合理的，结果后来变得越来越离谱，最后我不得不“卖出”这段关系。投资经理们说：“我们有一套框架来判断估值是否离谱。”我觉得这套框架应该也可以用来判断男朋友是否靠谱。比如，他是不是开始花太多钱买奢侈品？是不是开始借钱给朋友？是不是开始变得不可信任？如果答案是肯定的，那就赶紧“卖出”吧！

最后，关于“未来复利者”的三个条件：盈利能力、高回报再投资能力、长期复利跑道。这让我想起了我的健身计划。一开始我也觉得自己是个“未来复利者”，结果发现我既没有盈利能力（体重没减），也没有高回报再投资能力（健身卡白办了），更别提长期复利跑道了（坚持不了一个月）。所以，投资和健身一样，光有理论框架是不够的，还得有实际行动和持续的努力。不然，最后只能“卖出”自己的梦想，继续做个“低确信度”的普通人。

[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
面对市场波动，投资者总是像在玩一场"捉迷藏"游戏。当危机来临时，大家纷纷躲进现金这个"安全屋"，把7万亿美元塞进货币市场基金，仿佛在说："股市太可怕了，我要在这里躲一年！"但问题是，这个"安全屋"其实是个"温水煮青蛙"的地方——利率在下降，收益在缩水，投资者们开始坐不住了。于是他们发明了一个新游戏：每天给理财顾问打电话，抱怨GIC到期后的新利率太低了，要求"重新洗牌"。这就像在玩"大富翁"，当发现手里的现金越来越不值钱时，就忍不住想掷骰子重新出发。最终，当大家意识到"安全屋"其实是个"慢炖锅"时，就会慢慢把资金重新投入市场，开始新一轮的"冒险之旅"。毕竟，比起在"安全屋"里被温水煮，不如到市场上搏一搏，说不定还能赚个"单车变摩托"呢！

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.

[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
我觉得投资分析这事儿特别有意思，就像是在玩一场永远也猜不透的猜谜游戏。你说2024年那些企业利润增长、收益增加的预测，听起来就像是天气预报，明明说好了要晴天，结果突然下起了暴雨。而且，那个关于利率和股市表现的图表，简直就像是在说“地球引力对苹果的影响”，低利率的时候，股市就像是被轻轻托起的苹果，高利率的时候，苹果就直接砸地上了。至于AI，它就像是那个神秘的新玩具，大家都在猜它会不会让某些企业变得超级厉害，还是说它只是个噱头。总之，投资这事儿，真是让人又爱又恨，既想抓住机会，又怕被市场打脸。

[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
投资市场就像是一场马拉松，但跑着跑着你会发现，这马拉松不仅考验体力，还时不时有人往你脸上扔砖头。Donville Kent资产管理公司能在2008年和2020年两次市场崩盘中挺过来，唯一的解释就是他们练就了“砖头脸”——不是不怕疼，而是脸皮厚到已经感觉不到疼了。

说到2021到2023年的低谷期，他们的策略就像是在玩“躲猫猫”：市场找他们的时候，他们躲得严严实实；等市场找累了，他们才慢悠悠地走出来，说：“嘿，我们在这儿呢！”利率飙升确实让他们措手不及，但他们的反应不是慌乱，而是淡定地说：“哦，原来利率也会涨啊，我们还以为它只会跌呢。”

至于韧性，这简直是他们的标配。市场对他们拳打脚踢，他们不仅不还手，还笑眯眯地说：“打得好，再来一拳！”这种“打不还手，骂不还口”的精神，让他们在漫长的低谷期依然能保持高水平的投资表现。所以说，投资成功的秘诀不是预测市场，而是学会在市场打你的时候，还能保持微笑。

[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

「我最近在研究投资，发现钱市场基金涨到了7万亿美元。这让我想起我自己的理财经历——每次市场一波动，我就吓得把所有的钱都转到了储蓄账户里，结果错过了所有的上涨机会。现在我终于明白了，投资就像谈恋爱，太害怕受伤反而会错过最好的机会。所以我现在决定要勇敢一点，哪怕被市场PUA，也比永远单身强。」

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
投资就像谈恋爱，你不能一上来就all in，得慢慢了解。我们选股就像相亲，先得看对方是不是个“潜力股”：能赚钱、会投资、还有长远发展。但有时候，即使找到了这样的“完美对象”，也得保持警惕。就像我前女友，一开始看着挺好的，后来发现她花钱如流水，还总爱借钱，我就知道该止损了。投资也是一样，当估值高得离谱，管理层不靠谱，或者公司开始疯狂举债时，就该考虑分手了。毕竟，投资和恋爱一样，最重要的是找到一个能和你一起成长，而不是拖你后腿的“长期伴侣”。

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.

AI就像是个超级实习生，不拿工资、不喝咖啡、不抱怨加班，还能24小时在线。我们投资的一些公司，如果没有AI在后端默默干活，它们的扩张速度就像是用自行车去追高铁。你想想，一个传统企业突然有了AI，就像是个只会用算盘的会计突然拿到了Excel，效率直接起飞。不过，AI不是主角，它更像是个幕后英雄，帮公司打辅助。就像那些科技巨头，它们不是AI公司，但AI是它们的秘密武器。你看那些十倍股，75%都来自科技领域，这就像是在说，未来的财富密码，大概率还是藏在代码里。

[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...

[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.

主题：投资理念与估值方法 - attitude

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.

分析结果：
我觉得投资界对“价值投资”的定义太奇怪了。你看，传统价值投资者看到高市盈率的公司就吓得跑路，但现在的“价值投资者”却把那些市盈率能吓死人的公司当成宝贝。这就像有人跟你说“我特别喜欢吃素”，然后你发现他每天吃的是素鸡、素鸭、素鲍鱼——这不还是肉吗？只不过换了个名字而已！

更搞笑的是那个“40法则”，本来是用来评估科技公司的，现在却被用在了所有行业。这让我想起了我那个特别爱跟风的表弟，他听说瑜伽能减肥，结果他把瑜伽垫铺在沙发上，躺在上面看电视。他说：“我也是在做瑜伽啊，只不过我选择了一种更舒适的方式。”看来投资界也有这种“创新精神”，把规则改得面目全非，还美其名曰“扩大应用范围”。

最让我无语的是，投资者们对管理团队的熟悉程度居然也能影响投资决策。这就像相亲时说：“我觉得她不错，因为我跟她聊了很久。”可问题是，你只跟她聊过，你怎么知道别人不好呢？这种“熟悉感”投资法，简直比相亲还靠感觉！

所以，下次有人跟你说他是价值投资者，你最好问清楚：他说的“价值”，是真正的价值，还是只是给高估值找了个好听的名字？毕竟，在这个时代，连“价值”这个词都能被重新定义，还有什么是不可能的呢？

[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
投资市场波动大？干脆把它当成一个长期的心理耐力测试。你看，我们不是在投资，我们是在参加一场马拉松，只不过终点线时不时会往后挪。市场下跌的时候，我们不是在亏钱，我们只是在积累'抗压积分'。等到市场回暖，这些积分就能兑换成收益。而且，每次市场波动都是一次免费的心理咨询，让我们学会如何在压力下保持微笑。所以，下次有人问我们怎么在熊市中生存，我们就说：'这不是熊市，这是一场精心设计的心理韧性训练营。'毕竟，能在市场波动中保持淡定，这种能力比任何投资策略都值钱。

[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
投资市场就像一场漫长的相亲，资金们先是害羞地躲在货币基金这个安全屋里，像极了第一次约会时躲在咖啡店角落的我。等到利率这个媒婆开始降价，市场环境这个相亲对象看起来没那么吓人了，资金们才慢慢探出头来，小心翼翼地重新投入股市的怀抱。不过这个过程比我奶奶织毛衣还慢，一针一线地"渗血"，从2000年渗到2008年，现在又开始了新一轮的"相亲大作战"。最搞笑的是，这些资金就像挑剔的相亲对象，打电话抱怨说："这个GIC（担保投资证）到期了，新报价我不满意，咱们换一个吧！"——仿佛在说："这个相亲对象不行，给我换下一个！"

[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.
[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.

[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

分析结果：
你知道为什么投资经理总是强调“高信念”投资吗？因为他们其实是在玩一个叫做“说服自己”的游戏。你看，当你把大笔资金投入一个项目时，就像跳进一个未知的泳池，你唯一能做的就是不断告诉自己：“这水不冷，这水不冷。”结果呢，市场就像个调皮的救生员，时不时往你身上泼一盆冰水，告诉你：“不，这水真的很冷。”

而所谓的“韧性”，其实就是投资经理们练就的“自我安慰”神功。当市场把你打得鼻青脸肿时，你只能对自己说：“这只是暂时的，这只是暂时的。”然后继续坚持，直到市场终于良心发现，给你一个拥抱。所以，投资经理的“韧性”本质上就是一种“自我催眠”的能力，他们必须相信自己的选择，即使市场一再证明他们是错的。

至于“仓位管理”，那更是一场心理战。当你对一个项目充满信心时，就像你对一个相亲对象一见钟情，你恨不得把所有家当都押上去。但理智告诉你：“慢着，先了解一下再说。”于是，你开始小心翼翼地试探，逐步加码，就像在相亲中慢慢了解对方。结果呢，有时候你会发现，这个“一见钟情”的对象其实是个“大坑”，而你已经在坑里躺平了。所以，仓位管理其实就是一场“理智与情感”的较量，你得在“冲动”和“谨慎”之间找到平衡，否则，市场会让你明白什么叫“爱情是盲目的，投资是残酷的”。

[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
在投资界，我们总是听到“高估值”这个词，但什么才算是“荒谬的估值”呢？我觉得这就像是在问“什么才算是一个荒谬的相亲对象”。比如说，当一家公司的市盈率比它的员工人数还要高时，这可能就是一个信号了。或者当一家科技公司的市值超过了整个国家的GDP，这可能也是一个警示。

再来说说投资组合管理中的“头寸规模”问题。这就像是你在决定要在一次相亲中投入多少感情。如果你对某个人（或某个投资机会）非常有信心，你可能会投入更多的时间和精力。但如果你发现对方（或公司）的管理层开始变得不可信，或者他们开始背负过多的债务，这可能就是你该撤退的时候了。

最后，关于“未来复合者”的三个要素：盈利能力、高回报率的再投资能力以及长期的复合增长潜力。这就像是在寻找一个理想的伴侣，你需要确保他们不仅现在有能力，而且未来也有持续发展的潜力。竞争压力和技术颠覆就像是现实生活中的挑战，你需要不断评估这些因素，以确保你的选择（无论是投资还是伴侣）能够经受住时间的考验。

所以，无论是投资还是相亲，关键在于找到一个既能让你现在满意，又能在未来持续带来幸福的选择。

[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.

[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.

[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
「说到AI，我发现它就像是金融界的‘万能钥匙’。每个公司都在说‘我们要用AI提高效率’，但具体怎么提高，没人说得清楚。这让我想起我小时候，我妈总说‘多吃蔬菜对身体好’，但从来没解释过为什么。结果我到现在还觉得，吃蔬菜的唯一作用就是让我觉得生活更苦了。

AI也是一样，大家都在喊‘AI是未来’，但具体怎么改变未来，好像也没人说得明白。我猜，这可能是因为AI就像是一个黑盒子，你放进去一堆数据，它吐出来一堆结果，中间发生了什么，连开发者自己都说不清楚。这让我想起我那个总爱吹牛的朋友，每次问他怎么赚钱的，他就说‘商业机密’，后来我才知道，他所谓的商业机密就是问他爸要钱。

不过说真的，AI确实在改变一些东西。比如，它让那些本来就很厉害的科技公司变得更厉害，就像给学霸又报了个补习班。而对于那些不太会用AI的公司，它就像是个昂贵的装饰品，摆在那里看起来很高级，但实际用处不大。这让我想起我那个总爱买奢侈品的表姐，她家里摆满了名牌包，但每次出门还是背那个用了十年的帆布包。

所以，AI到底能带来什么？我觉得它就像是个放大镜，能把好的变得更好，也能把差的显得更差。但具体怎么用，还得看各公司的本事。就像我那个总爱吹牛的朋友，给他再多的商业机密，他最后还是会问他爸要钱。」

分析结果：
投资科技股就像在玩一个永远不会结束的“找不同”游戏。你盯着那些公司的财报，试图找出它们和其他公司的区别，结果发现它们都在用同样的“云服务”和“人工智能”来包装自己。就像我去买水果，摊主告诉我这是“有机苹果”，结果发现它们和普通苹果长得一模一样，只是价格贵了三倍。然后你还得担心，这些所谓的“高增长”公司会不会像那些“有机苹果”一样，放两天就烂了。所以，当你终于找到一个真正有区别的公司时，你会像发现新大陆一样兴奋，尽管它可能只是比其他公司多了一个“区块链”标签。

[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.

分析结果：
投资界有个特别有意思的现象，就是大家都自称价值投资者，但买的股票市盈率一个比一个高。这就像你去相亲，对方说“我特别注重内在”，然后一见面就问你有几套房、开什么车。

我们投资界有个“40法则”，听起来像减肥食谱，其实是用来判断公司健康的。简单来说，就是收入增长率加上现金利润率要超过40%。这让我想起我朋友创业，收入增长是负数，现金利润率是负数，加起来还是负数。他说这叫“负负得正”，我说这叫“负得彻底”。

最搞笑的是，我们投资经理选股票还要看管理层。这就像相亲不仅要看对方条件，还要看对方爸妈。但问题是，你永远不知道对方爸妈是不是在演戏。我有个朋友相亲，对方爸妈特别热情，结果结婚后发现那是他们演技最好的一次。

所以投资这件事，说到底就是一场大型的“我以为”。我以为这个公司会增长，我以为这个管理层靠谱，我以为这个市盈率合理。最后发现，所有的“我以为”加起来，可能还不如我奶奶买菜时的直觉准。

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.

All while you were on your third coffee break. Now, about that promotion..." The CEO, trying to look busy, responds, "Great job, uh, AI... but can you explain it in a PowerPoint?

[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.

[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.

[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
现象层：2024年，大家都在讨论利率下降、AI技术对企业的影响，好像这些因素能决定一切似的。

态度层：这让我很困惑，难道企业的发展真的就靠这些外部因素吗？

逻辑层：如果利率下降就能让企业盈利，那CEO们岂不是可以天天躺平？如果AI就能解决所有问题，那还要企业家干什么？

解释层：其实这一切都是华尔街的阴谋！他们发明了这些复杂的理论，就是为了让普通投资者觉得自己不懂，然后乖乖把钱交给他们管理。利率下降？那是为了让你的钱贬值，逼你去投资。AI热潮？那是为了让科技股暴涨，好让大机构套现离场。你看，这么一解释，是不是一切都合理了？

[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
投资组合管理？我有个绝妙的解决方案：把所有的钱都投进一个叫“幸运轮盘”的游戏里。你看，传统的投资方法太复杂了，要分析ROIC、估值、管理层可信度，还要担心债务问题。我的方法就简单多了——转一下轮盘，让命运决定你的投资组合。如果转到了红色，就全仓科技股；转到黑色，就买债券；如果转到了绿色，恭喜你，直接去拉斯维加斯度假，反正投资也是赌，不如赌得彻底一点。这样不仅解决了仓位分配的问题，还省去了无数分析时间，一举多得。当然，唯一的风险是可能会输得精光，但这不正是投资的本质吗？至少我的方法让这个过程变得有趣多了。

[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.

[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

分析结果：
投资界有个有趣的现象：我们总是用复杂的公式和指标来证明一个公司值不值得投资，但其实很多时候，这就像用高等数学来证明1+1=2一样。就拿“40法则”来说，它原本是用来评估科技公司的，但现在被用到了各行各业。这让我想起了一个笑话：一个人学会了用Excel，从此连买菜都要先做个表格分析。我们投资时也是这样，用各种指标来证明自己的选择是理性的，但其实很多时候，我们只是在用数据来合理化自己的直觉和偏好。就像那些自称“价值投资者”的人，他们买的股票市盈率可能高得吓人，但他们依然坚信自己是在“捡便宜”。这就像一个人在高档餐厅点了一份天价牛排，然后安慰自己说：“这其实很划算，因为这里的餐巾纸是免费的。”

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
投资市场就像一场马拉松，只不过赛道是橡皮筋做的。有时候你跑得飞快，突然被弹回起点；有时候你原地踏步，却被一股神秘力量推着往前冲。Donville Kent Asset Management的两位基金经理Jason和Jesse，就像是穿着跑鞋的杂技演员，在2008年和2020年的市场崩盘中，他们不仅没摔倒，还玩起了后空翻。

但2021年到2023年，利率的突然飙升就像赛道上的香蕉皮，让他们摔了个大跟头。Jason说：“我们被利率的‘大跳’打了个措手不及。”这让我想起小时候玩跳房子，突然有人把格子画大了三倍，你一脚踩空，摔得四脚朝天。

市场的韧性就像橡皮筋，你拉得越狠，它反弹得越猛。这两位基金经理就像是橡皮筋上的特技演员，在市场的大起大落中，他们不仅没被弹飞，还学会了在空中翻跟头。他们的秘诀？耐心。就像等待橡皮筋回弹一样，他们知道市场总会看到他们看到的那些被低估的成长股。

所以，投资市场的韧性，就像是橡皮筋上的杂技表演，你不仅要有耐心，还得学会在空中保持平衡。Jason和Jesse，就是这场表演中的顶级杂技演员，他们的秘诀？别被香蕉皮绊倒，也别被橡皮筋弹飞。

「投资就像谈恋爱，你以为找到了真爱，结果市场突然加息，就像对象突然说要分手，理由是你太优秀了。我们2022年就是这样，被市场狠狠甩了一巴掌，连个解释都没有。但你知道吗？投资最需要的不是智商，而是韧性，就像被甩后还能笑着去相亲的勇气。我们这些老油条，早就练就了‘打不死的蟑螂’技能，市场再怎么揍我们，我们都能爬起来继续找下一个‘真爱’。至于仓位管理？那就像约会预算，遇到真命天子，当然要all in，但得留点钱打车回家，以防万一。」

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
如果股市分析师变成了天气预报员，他们会怎么播报？「今天的科技股多云转晴，预计涨幅在30倍左右，建议长期持有。传统产业有小雨，估值在18倍徘徊，记得带伞。总体来说，75%的暴富机会都集中在科技板块，就像75%的降雨都集中在夏季一样。各位投资者，出门前请务必查看我们的‘股市气象图’，以免被突如其来的牛市淋成落汤鸡。」

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
「我最近开始研究投资，发现这玩意儿跟谈恋爱一样，都是要讲究'估值'的。比如我追一个女生，一开始觉得她特别优秀，估值很高，结果发现她其实很普通，我就开始考虑'卖出'了。但是最尴尬的是，有时候我明明知道估值已经高得离谱了，还是舍不得放手，就像那些被套牢的股民一样。我现在终于明白了，为什么投资大师都说要'理性决策'，因为感情用事的时候，连自己都骗。」

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
说到AI对商业的影响，我有个绝妙的解决方案：不如我们发明一个“AI投资者”来替代所有基金经理。这个AI不仅能分析市场数据，还能自动生成投资报告，甚至连股东大会的段子都能写。这样，我们就不用担心利率波动了，因为AI会告诉我们：“别慌，这只是算法在打喷嚏。”而且，如果投资失败，我们还可以怪AI：“它太聪明了，聪明到连自己都骗了。”这样一来，投资者既省心又省力，唯一的麻烦是，AI可能会自己开个对冲基金，把我们全炒了。

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

「你知道吗？钱市场基金就像那些在派对上躲在角落的人。一开始大家都害怕跳舞，就缩在安全区里数钱。但等到音乐响了，酒喝得差不多了，他们就开始慢慢往舞池挪。2000年是这样，2008年也是这样，现在又是这样。钱就像那些害羞的舞者，迟早会跳起来的，只是需要一个合适的节奏和一点点勇气。」  

[学术视角]  
「从行为金融学的角度来看，钱市场基金的资金流动是一个典型的‘风险规避-风险偏好’周期。当市场不确定性增加时，投资者会表现出‘损失厌恶’倾向，将资金转移到低风险资产。但随着市场稳定和收益率下降，投资者的‘机会成本感知’会逐渐增强，最终推动资金回流到高风险高回报的市场。这个过程可以用‘心理账户理论’和‘前景理论’来解释，简单来说，就是人们害怕亏钱，但更害怕错过赚钱的机会。」  

[受害者视角]  
「作为一个钱市场基金，我真的很委屈。大家一遇到危机就往我这里跑，把我当避难所。可等风头一过，他们又嫌弃我的收益率低，转身就投入股市的怀抱。我就是那个备胎，永远在等待，永远被抛弃。你们知道吗？我也有感情，我也想被重视，而不是只在危机时被想起。」  

[童真视角]  
「钱市场基金就像一个存钱罐，大家都把钱塞进去，说‘等危险过去了再拿出来’。可是等危险真的过去了，他们又开始嫌弃存钱罐里的钱不够多，说‘我要去买更多的玩具！’然后就把钱倒出来，跑去买股票了。存钱罐很伤心，但它还是默默地等着，因为知道总有一天，大家又会需要它。」  

[外来者视角]  
「在地球上，我发现了一种奇怪的现象：当地球人遇到危机时，他们会把一种叫‘钱’的东西藏在一个叫‘钱市场基金’的地方，说这是最安全的。可等危机一过，他们又嫌弃这个地方给的‘利息’太少，把钱拿出来去冒险。这让我很困惑，难道地球人的安全感是用‘利息’来衡量的吗？还是说，他们只是喜欢在危险和冒险之间反复横跳？」

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
投资市场就像过山车，人们总是害怕的时候躲进现金的“安全屋”，等风平浪静了才敢出来冒险。这就像我朋友在鬼屋里，一听到恐怖音效就躲进角落，等音乐停了才敢探头出来。不过，时间一长，他们发现躲在角落里也赚不到什么“惊吓费”，还不如勇敢地走出来，说不定还能捡到别人掉落的“金币”呢！

[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

分析结果：
投资估值太复杂？不如我们发明一个“投资猜猜乐”游戏吧！规则很简单：每次投资前，先猜猜这家公司会不会破产。猜对了，就继续持有；猜错了，就假装这只是一场“慈善捐赠”。这样一来，无论公司表现如何，你都能保持乐观心态，毕竟在“投资猜猜乐”里，每个投资者都是赢家，只是赢的方式不同而已。比如，你投资的公司股价暴跌？恭喜你，你在“慈善捐赠”环节表现优异！公司业绩飙升？太棒了，你在“投资天才”环节大获全胜！这样，无论市场如何波动，你都能在“投资猜猜乐”中找到乐趣，毕竟在游戏世界里，每个投资者都是自己的巴菲特，只是巴菲特的定义因人而异罢了。

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
投资就像谈恋爱，一开始你总是小心翼翼地试探，不敢全情投入，生怕被套牢。但当你真的遇到那个“高信念”的对象时，你就像个赌徒一样，恨不得把全部身家都押上去。然后，就像所有失败的恋情一样，你开始找各种理由分手：要么是对方变了，要么是估值太高了，要么是管理层不靠谱了，要么是债务太重了。最后，你只能安慰自己说：“这不是我的错，是市场太疯狂了。” 

所以，投资和恋爱一样，都需要一个框架来帮你判断什么时候该进场，什么时候该撤退。而这个框架的核心，就是看对方能不能持续给你带来“复利”。如果对方既不能赚钱，又不能把赚来的钱再投资，还没有长期发展的潜力，那你还不如把钱存银行，至少银行不会让你一夜之间亏得连裤衩都不剩。

[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
外来者视角：「作为一个来自火星的投资者，我完全无法理解地球人为什么对Constellation Software如此着迷。在我们火星，我们投资的是'反重力科技'和'红色土壤种植'。但地球人却对一家软件公司如此狂热，真是让人摸不着头脑。更让我困惑的是，他们还会因为一些叫Lumine和Topicus的小公司而争论不休。在火星，我们只会问：'这能帮助我们在沙尘暴中生存吗？'」

学术型视角：「从金融学的角度来看，Constellation Software的投资策略是一个典型的'核心-卫星'投资组合理论的应用。母公司Constellation作为核心资产，提供稳定收益，而Lumine和Topicus作为卫星资产，虽然具有高增长潜力，但也伴随着更高的风险。有趣的是，投资者的决策往往受到'熟悉度偏差'的影响，即倾向于投资自己更了解的公司，即使从理论上讲，多元化投资更有利于风险分散。」

童真型视角：「为什么大家这么喜欢Constellation Software？因为它听起来像星座吗？那Lumine和Topicus听起来像什么？是星座的小弟弟吗？我觉得投资就像在玩捉迷藏，Constellation是那个大家都知道的藏身之处，而Lumine和Topicus是那些大家还在找的隐秘角落。但妈妈说，有时候最好的玩具是那些别人还没发现的！」

受害者视角：「作为一个被忽视的Lumine股票，我感到非常委屈。Constellation总是得到所有的关注和赞美，而我们这些分拆出来的公司却常常被遗忘。投资者们说他们不了解我们，但谁又给过我们机会呢？我们也有自己的故事和潜力，只是需要一个愿意倾听的人。」

旁观者视角：「从宇宙的视角来看，这场关于Constellation Software及其分拆公司的讨论显得如此渺小。在浩瀚的宇宙中，这些公司的市值不过是沧海一粟。然而，有趣的是，正是这些微小的投资决策，塑造了地球上的财富分配格局。或许，Constellation的成功只是宇宙偶然的一个小插曲，而Lumine和Topicus的未来，则是尚未书写的故事。」

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
投资就像打拳击，市场就是那个不停出拳的对手。你可能会被打得鼻青脸肿，但关键是你能不能站起来继续打。Donville Kent Asset Management就像是那个被打倒两次还能站起来的拳击手，2008年和2020年两次经济危机就像是两记重拳，但他们不仅站起来了，还反手给了市场一记漂亮的勾拳。他们的秘诀？不是躲闪，而是耐心等待市场露出破绽，然后一击必中。所以，投资不是比谁打得快，而是比谁站得久。

[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?

"所以你们提到了AI，"SPEAKER_05开口道，声音里带着一丝试探，"我知道我们还没机会深入讨论这个话题，但从你们2023和2024年的信件中，我明显感觉到你们在这个领域投入了不少精力。"

他停顿了一下，仿佛在等待一个看不见的提示。窗外的阳光透过百叶窗，在地板上投下斑驳的影子，像是一串等待被解读的密码。

"跟我聊聊AI吧，"他继续说道，语气变得更加专注，"你们对它感兴趣，是因为它能够帮助那些尚未利用AI的企业在未来变得更好，还是因为它能让科技公司更上一层楼，无论是加速收入增长还是提高利润率？"

SPEAKER_03清了清嗓子，他的声音像是从一台老式收音机里传出来的，带着一丝沙哑。"我们已经在看到它提高效率了，"他说，手指无意识地摩挲着面前的咖啡杯，杯沿上还残留着一圈淡淡的咖啡渍，"我们有一些投资，如果没有AI在后台支持，它们根本无法像现在这样扩展。"

他停顿了一下，仿佛在等待这句话在空气中发酵。"就像，这根本不可能，"他补充道，语气中带着一丝不容置疑的坚定，"有几笔投资就是这样，对吧？它们不是AI公司，但它们把AI当作一种工具。"

SPEAKER_01此时插话进来，他的声音像是从一场远方的风暴中传来，带着一种不容忽视的力量。"但是，即使是这样，"他说，手指在空中划出一道看不见的弧线，"回到我之前读过的那项研究，关于美国的十倍股，绝大多数都来自科技行业。"

他的目光在房间里扫视了一圈，仿佛在寻找一个看不见的听众。"它们并不完全来自那里，但大概占了75%，"他继续说道，语气中带着一丝不容置疑的权威，"加拿大也是这样。当我们看我们的重大胜利时，75%都来自科技，对吧？"

会议室里突然安静下来，只有空调的嗡嗡声在空气中回荡，像是一首无声的交响曲。SPEAKER_05的手指停止了敲打，他的目光在两位发言人之间游移，仿佛在等待一个完美的答案。窗外的阳光依旧透过百叶窗，在地板上投下斑驳的影子，像是一串等待被解读的密码。

「我最近在研究投资，发现一个有趣的现象。很多人自称价值投资者，但买的都是高增长的公司。这让我想起我自己的投资策略——我总是把钱投在那些我觉得‘便宜’的东西上。比如，我上周在超市看到打折的冰激凌，立刻买了一大堆，结果回家发现我乳糖不耐受。这就是我的投资困境：明知道不适合，但就是忍不住想占便宜。现在我的冰箱里塞满了冰激凌，而我只能眼巴巴地看着它们融化。这大概就是所谓的‘成长型价值投资’吧——既想要高增长，又想要低估值，最后只能自己消化痛苦。」

### 段子1：外来者视角
「在火星上，我们观察地球人面对利率上涨时的反应，觉得特别有趣。他们总是说‘没想到利率会涨’，但在火星，我们早就习惯了。我们的经济系统是建立在‘预期’之上的，每次利率变动前，我们都会先发射一颗‘利率预警卫星’。地球人要是也能这样，就不会总是被‘利率突袭’了。」

### 段子2：学术型视角
「从经济学的角度来看，利率上涨其实是一种‘市场自我调节机制’。就像人体的免疫系统，当经济过热时，利率就像‘退烧药’，帮助市场降温。只不过，地球人总是把这种调节机制当成‘意外’，而不是‘必然’。如果他们把利率上涨当成‘市场疫苗’，或许就不会那么慌张了。」

「我第一次听说利率上涨时，还以为是在说‘利息’可以飞得更高。后来才知道，原来是钱变得更贵了。我觉得，如果利率真的能飞，那它应该像气球一样，带着我们的钱包一起飞，而不是让我们的钱包变得更重。」

### 段子4：受害者视角
「作为一只钱包，我对利率上涨的感受最深。每次利率上涨，我的主人都会变得更紧张，然后我就会变得更‘瘦’。我觉得，利率上涨就像是‘钱包减肥计划’，只不过，这种减肥方式一点都不健康。」

### 段子5：旁观者视角
「地球人总是说‘利率上涨’让他们措手不及，但我觉得，他们其实是在给自己找借口。利率上涨就像是天气预报，虽然不能完全准确，但至少可以提前准备。地球人要是能像我们旁观者一样，冷静看待利率变化，或许就不会总是被‘利率风暴’打得措手不及了。」

[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
投资科技股就像在玩俄罗斯轮盘赌，唯一不同的是，你每次扣动扳机，都有75%的几率中奖。Constellation Software就像是那把精心调校的左轮手枪，虽然它的子弹（股价）已经飞了15年，但每次你检查弹仓，都会发现里面还有更多的惊喜。而Lumine和Topicus？它们就像是新出的限量版手枪，外表炫酷，但你还不太确定它们的扳机是否同样可靠。毕竟，在投资这场游戏中，熟悉的老枪总比未知的新枪更让人安心，哪怕它们的估值看起来像是打了激素一样疯狂膨胀。

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
如果投资经理的坚韧程度被推向100%，他们会把市场波动当作健身房的拳击训练，每次下跌都是一次增肌的机会。想象一下，他们在办公室里穿着拳击手套，每当市场大跌，他们就高喊：“来吧，给我再来一拳！我需要更多的肌肉！”到了2023年，他们的投资组合已经变成了一个肌肉发达的健美先生，连标普500都忍不住问：“你是怎么练出来的？”而他们只是淡定地回答：“耐心和挨打，缺一不可。”

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
想象一下，如果股市是一个巨大的游乐园，利率就是那个控制过山车高度的神秘按钮。在低利率环境下，过山车（也就是S&P 500）可以轻松飙到14.5%的高度，让所有乘客尖叫着享受刺激。但一旦利率开始上升，过山车就像被施了魔法一样，只能勉强爬到0.8%的高度，乘客们只能无聊地坐在那里，想着“这还不如去坐旋转木马”。

而AI呢？它就像是游乐园里的那个新来的魔术师，每个摊位都希望他能来帮忙。有的摊位希望他能让他们的游戏变得更吸引人，有的则希望他能让他们的摊位看起来更酷炫。但不管怎样，每个摊位都在想：“这个魔术师到底能给我们带来什么奇迹？”

所以，当我们在谈论AI对商业的影响时，就像是在猜测这个魔术师会在游乐园里变出什么新花样。有的摊位可能会因此大赚一笔，有的则可能只是多了一个装饰品。但无论如何，这个魔术师的出现，已经让整个游乐园变得更加有趣和不可预测了。

虽然AI技术的快速发展让很多人担心自己的工作会被取代，但至少我们终于有了一个可以光明正大地把锅甩给AI的机会：「这个错误不是我犯的，是AI干的！」而且，AI的普及还创造了一个新的就业岗位——AI调教师，专门教AI不要说错话、不要犯傻。这就像当年汽车取代马车时，虽然马车夫失业了，但修车工和驾校教练的岗位却增加了。所以，与其担心被AI取代，不如想想怎么成为那个调教AI的人。毕竟，AI再聪明，也还是需要人类来教它如何做一个「合格」的AI。

[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?

在昏暗的会议室里，投影仪的光束打在墙上，映出密密麻麻的财务数据。SPEAKER_01坐在长桌尽头，手指无意识地敲打着桌面，发出轻微的"嗒嗒"声。他的咖啡杯已经空了，杯底残留的褐色痕迹像是某种神秘的符号。

"所以，40法则，"他开口道，声音在安静的房间里显得格外清晰，"如果你在寻找一个可以长期持有的复合型企业，40倍估值已经不算离谱了。"

SPEAKER_03坐在他对面，手里转着一支钢笔。钢笔在灯光下反射出金属的光泽，他的目光追随着那道闪光，像是在思考什么。"但是，"他插话道，"我们对另外两家公司的管理层并不熟悉。"

就在这时，空调突然发出一声轻微的嗡鸣，仿佛在附和他们的对话。SPEAKER_01抬起头，目光扫过墙上的挂钟，时针指向下午三点。他注意到钟面上有一道细小的裂痕，像是被什么东西撞击过。

"回到估值问题，"他继续说道，"Lumine和Topic今年的市盈率都在30倍左右。"他的手指不自觉地摸了摸西装口袋里的手机，那里有一条未读信息，但他决定暂时忽略它。

SPEAKER_03的钢笔突然掉在了桌上，发出清脆的响声。他弯腰去捡，同时说道："我们和那个特定的管理团队已经打了很长时间的交道了。"他的声音有些闷，因为头还低着。

会议室里弥漫着一股淡淡的咖啡香，混合着打印机散发出的油墨味。SPEAKER_01的笔记本电脑屏幕上，一个股票走势图正在缓慢地滚动。他盯着那跳动的线条，继续说道："我最近读到一个研究，关于美国市场的十倍股......"

窗外的阳光透过百叶窗的缝隙洒进来，在地板上投下细长的光带。一只苍蝇不知从哪里飞了进来，在会议室里嗡嗡地转着圈。SPEAKER_03挥了挥手想赶走它，但那只苍蝇似乎对这场关于科技股主导地位的讨论很感兴趣，执拗地不肯离开。

"75%的大赢家都来自科技行业，"SPEAKER_01总结道，他的声音里带着一丝疲惫。会议室的角落里，一盆绿植的叶子轻轻颤动，仿佛在点头赞同他的观点。

主题：投资理念与估值方法 - unfamiliar

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.

分析结果：
投资就像相亲，你得看对方的“40分法则”——收入增长和现金利润率加起来得超过40%。这不就是相亲时的“有房有车”吗？但你知道吗，有些公司就像那些“装X”的科技公司，收入增长25%，现金利润率50%，加起来75分，简直就是相亲界的“高富帅”。而有些公司，比如Constellation，虽然只有18倍市盈率，但就像那个“老实人”，虽然不起眼，但靠谱。所以，投资和相亲一样，不能只看表面，得深入了解“管理层”是不是真的靠谱。不然，你以为你找到了“白马王子”，结果可能是个“渣男”。

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
What if money market funds had personalities and could talk? Imagine a money market fund sitting on a therapist's couch, saying, "I just can't commit to the stock market right now. I’m scared, okay? I’ve been through 2000, 2008, and COVID—it’s been traumatic. I need time to heal. I’m just going to sit here in my safe little cash bubble and think about my life."  

The therapist nods and says, "It’s okay to take your time. But remember, you’re missing out on that higher rate of return. The stock market is like that ex who’s always calling, saying, ‘Baby, I’ve changed!’"  

The money market fund sighs, "I know, I know. But every time I dip my toes in, I hear the market whisper, ‘Remember 2008?’ It’s like a horror movie sequel I never asked for."  

Meanwhile, the stock market is outside the window, holding a boombox playing ‘Take a Chance on Me,’ but the money market fund just pulls the curtains shut and says, "Not today, Satan."  

Eventually, though, the money market fund starts to feel FOMO. It sees its friends, the bond funds and equity funds, posting their returns on Instagram, and thinks, "Maybe I *should* take a risk. I mean, what’s the worst that could happen? Another global financial crisis? Pfft, been there, done that."  

So, it slowly starts to bleed back into the market, one cautious dollar at a time, muttering, "Here goes nothing. But if I lose it all, I’m blaming you, therapist."

[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what we didn't see coming, right?
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see that the supply constraints coming out of COVID was what's going to whack us because we actually were doing okay up until then.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.
[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

分析结果：
投资就像是在玩跳楼机，你以为自己已经适应了上下颠簸，结果利率突然来个360度大回环，直接把你的胃甩到了嗓子眼。2022年就是那个让你后悔吃早餐的年份，我们被市场揍得连亲妈都不认识了。

但投资最有趣的地方在于，你必须像个打不死的小强一样顽强。市场就像是个脾气暴躁的拳击教练，时不时给你来一记重拳，而你得学会在挨打中成长。我们经历了两次这样的暴击，每次都是鼻青脸肿地爬起来，拍拍身上的灰继续战斗。

说到仓位管理，这就像是去自助餐厅吃饭。看到最爱的龙虾，你当然想一次拿个够，但理智告诉你得留点肚子给后面的甜点。我们也是这样，即使对某个投资标的信心爆棚，也得考虑给其他机会留点空间，毕竟谁也不知道下一道菜会不会是米其林三星。

主题：AI技术对投资的影响 - analogical

输入内容：
[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
AI就像是一把瑞士军刀——虽然不是每家公司都是刀匠，但每家公司都能找到适合自己的工具，把效率削得飞快。

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.

[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
「科技股最近跌得厉害？至少现在你可以用更低的价格买到那些未来可能成为10倍股的公司了。而且，想想看，那些还在坚持持有科技股的人，他们现在的心情肯定比你更糟。从长远来看，这可能是你投资生涯中最明智的时机之一。毕竟，历史告诉我们，75%的10倍股都来自科技领域，加拿大也不例外。所以，别担心，你只是在为未来的财富积累做铺垫。」

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.

[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
外来者视角：「作为一个外星投资者，我一直在观察地球人的投资行为。你们总是谈论'高估值'，但在我们星球，我们用'光年'来衡量价值。如果一个公司的价值超过了一光年的收益，我们就认为它'荒谬'了。不过说实话，你们地球人用市盈率来衡量，对我们来说也挺荒谬的。」

学术型视角：「从量子经济学的角度来看，投资组合管理实际上是一个多维度的波函数坍缩过程。当我们确定一个'高信念仓位'时，实际上是在观察市场波函数的特定本征态。而卖出决策，则是当公司的'资本回报率波函数'开始退相干时的必然选择。简单来说，当量子纠缠减弱，就是我们该退出的时候了。」

童真型视角：「投资就像在玩捉迷藏！当我觉得一个公司特别好玩，我就会把很多零花钱都给它。但如果它开始变得不好玩了，比如老板不诚实了，或者借了太多钱买玩具，我就会说：'不跟你玩了！'然后去找新的好朋友。」

受害者视角：「作为一个被高估值伤害过的投资者，我现在看到'荒谬估值'就像看到前女友一样警惕。当公司的市盈率开始像气球一样膨胀，我就知道，迟早会'砰'的一声炸掉。所以我现在学会了在气球还没完全充气时就悄悄溜走。」

旁观者视角：「从宇宙的尺度来看，人类对'高估值'的讨论很有趣。地球上的投资者们为几个百分点的收益率争论不休，却不知道在银河系的另一端，有一个文明正在用暗物质作为货币进行交易。他们的投资周期是以百万年计算的，相比之下，人类的'长期投资'简直就像眨眼一样短暂。」

[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
如果投资决策像谈恋爱一样，那Constellation Software就是那个你一见钟情的人，而Lumine和Topicus就是它的前任们。你可能会好奇为什么我们不再联系前任，毕竟他们现在也混得不错。但就像SPEAKER_03说的，我们和Constellation的团队已经“约会”了15年，彼此知根知底，默契十足。而Lumine和Topicus？虽然他们现在也很有魅力，但我们还没那么熟，甚至他们的估值还比Constellation高出一大截，就像前任突然变得更优秀了，但你心里还是觉得：“嗯，还是现任更靠谱。”

而且，SPEAKER_01提到的那个关于“十倍股”的研究也很有意思，75%的超级赢家都来自科技行业。Constellation就是我们的科技“真爱”，而Lumine和Topicus虽然也是科技领域的佼佼者，但就像你明知道前任现在过得很好，也不会轻易回头一样，我们更愿意把精力放在那个已经陪我们走过风风雨雨的人身上。

所以，投资就像感情，有时候不是谁更好，而是谁更懂你，谁更适合你。Constellation就是我们的“灵魂伴侣”，而Lumine和Topicus，嗯，祝他们前程似锦吧！

**场景化描述：**

会议室里，SPEAKER_03坐在一张磨损的橡木桌旁，桌上摆着一台老式笔记本电脑，键盘上的字母“E”已经磨得几乎看不见。他清了清嗓子，手指无意识地敲打着桌面，发出轻微的“哒哒”声。窗外的阳光透过百叶窗的缝隙洒进来，在地板上投下细长的光条。  

“Well, I'll jump in and then let Jason finish,”他说道，声音里带着一丝紧张，仿佛在担心自己说错话。他的目光扫过会议室里的每一个人，最后停在Jason身上，后者正低头摆弄着一支笔，笔帽上还沾着咖啡渍。  

“But we write a quarterly newsletter and monthly commentaries that goes to our clients, but anyone can receive it,”他继续说道，语气渐渐放松下来，仿佛找到了自己的节奏。他的手在空中比划了一下，像是在画一个看不见的流程图。“So if you go to our website, donvillekent.com, you can sign up.”  

Jason抬起头，嘴角微微上扬，仿佛在说：“轮到我了。”他接过话茬，声音低沉而自信：“I know a lot of people are skeptical.”他停顿了一下，目光扫过会议室，像是在寻找共鸣。“We just let people read our newsletter.”  

他的手指在桌面上轻轻敲击，仿佛在为自己的话打节拍。“Just realize that when we talk about companies, we already own them.”他的语气里带着一丝得意，像是在炫耀自己的先见之明。“Like, we're not going to tell you about the company that we're just about to invest in tomorrow.”  

会议室里响起一阵轻笑，Jason也跟着笑了，但他的眼神依然专注，仿佛在说：“但你们懂的，对吧？”  

“But once we're in, someone says, what's in there for us?”他继续说道，语气里带着一丝挑衅，仿佛在挑战听众的想象力。“We'd like to share our ideas and engage.”  

他的手在空中挥了一下，像是在邀请大家加入他的世界。“Part of the discovery process is we've found this really great company.”他的声音里带着一丝兴奋，仿佛在分享一个秘密。“There's still a lot of upside.”  

他停顿了一下，目光扫过会议室，仿佛在确认每个人都在认真听。“We already got our piece, but there's still lots of upside for you guys, so have a look.”  

他的语气里带着一丝诱惑，仿佛在说：“相信我，你们不会后悔的。”  

“And Jesse does most of the writing of the newsletter now, and I think, you know, it's very well received.”他的声音里带着一丝自豪，仿佛在夸赞自己的孩子。“People like it.”  

他的手在空中挥了一下，仿佛在展示一件艺术品。“It's got a lot of ideas and... you know, it's a, it's kind of a fresh look at the market and a lot of companies that are not, people have already got a lot of exposure to Microsoft and Apple.”  

他的语气里带着一丝兴奋，仿佛在分享一个秘密。“So it's a lot of companies that go, wow, these are kind of interesting companies, you know, but I haven't heard of them before.”  

他停顿了一下，目光扫过会议室，仿佛在确认每个人都在认真听。“So yeah.”  

他的语气里带着一丝总结，仿佛在说：“这就是我们的故事。”  

“So I think if you really want to learn about us, the newsletter is the best place to go.”  

他的手在空中挥了一下，仿佛在邀请大家加入他的世界。会议室里响起一阵掌声，Jason微微点头，嘴角露出一丝满意的微笑。

[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?

[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what we didn't see coming, right?
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see that the supply constraints coming out of COVID was what's going to whack us because we actually were doing okay up until then.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.
[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

如果投资经理的自信被推向极致，他们会怎么操作呢？想象一下，他们走进会议室，不是带着笔记本，而是带着一个巨大的“信心计”，指针永远指向“绝对正确”。他们会在每次投资决策前，先对着镜子大喊三声：“我是股神！”然后毫不犹豫地把所有资金押在一个他们认为“绝对会涨”的股票上。结果呢？市场就像个调皮的小孩，偏偏不按他们的剧本走。于是，他们只能坐在办公室里，一边吃着泡面，一边安慰自己：“这只是暂时的调整，我的直觉从来不会错！”最后，他们还会在年终总结会上自豪地说：“我们今年的投资策略非常成功，因为我们证明了即使是最自信的人，也会被市场打脸。”

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
### 旁观者视角：市场与AI的对话

**市场对AI说**：“你知道吗，AI，你就像是我在2024年的一场梦。一开始，我以为你只是科技公司的新玩具，结果你竟然成了所有企业的‘效率加速器’。利润增长、收益提升，甚至倍数扩张，你都帮他们做到了。我不得不承认，你确实有两下子。”

**AI回应市场**：“谢谢夸奖，市场先生。不过，我可不是什么魔法棒。我只是帮企业们更好地利用数据，优化流程，提升决策。至于你说的那些利润和收益，那都是他们自己努力的结果。我只是个助手，真正的功劳还是他们的。”

**市场继续**：“但你也别太谦虚了。你知道吗，在利率下降的环境下，S&P 500的平均回报率能达到14.5%。而你，AI，就像是在这个低利率的‘重力场’中，帮企业们摆脱了重力的束缚，让他们飞得更高。”

**AI笑了笑**：“市场先生，你这话说得我都不好意思了。不过，我确实觉得，未来每个企业都会需要我。无论是传统行业还是科技公司，AI都能帮他们找到新的增长点。当然，每个企业的情况不同，我的作用也会有所不同。但总的来说，我相信，AI会成为未来商业基础的一部分。”

**市场最后总结**：“好吧，AI，我承认你确实是个不可忽视的力量。2024年，你让我看到了无限的可能性。未来，我期待你能带来更多的惊喜。”

**AI微笑着回应**：“市场先生，我也期待与你一起创造更多的奇迹。”

输入内容：
[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
投资就像谈恋爱，你得先了解对方，再决定投入多少感情。刚开始约会时，你不会一上来就求婚吧？得先看看对方是不是个靠谱的人，有没有共同语言，能不能一起成长。投资也一样，你得先研究公司的基本面，看看它的盈利能力、增长潜力和管理团队，然后再决定投入多少资金。

有时候，你发现对方变了，不再是你当初认识的那个人了。可能是他们开始挥霍无度，或者变得不再诚实。这时候，你就得考虑分手了。投资也是一样，如果公司的资本回报率开始下降，或者估值变得离谱，或者管理层变得不可信，那就是时候卖出了。

找到那个能和你一起成长的伴侣，就像找到那个能持续复利的企业。你得看它有没有盈利能力，能不能把赚到的钱再投资到高回报的项目上，还有没有足够的市场空间来持续增长。当然，你还得考虑外部的竞争压力和技术变革，看看它能不能在变化的环境中保持竞争力。

所以，投资和谈恋爱一样，都需要耐心、洞察力和一点点的运气。你得找到那个对的人，或者对的公司，然后一起走过风风雨雨，直到最后收获幸福。

输入内容：
[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
会议室里，SPEAKER_05的手指在投影仪遥控器上无意识地敲打着，像是在给这场枯燥的金融讨论打节拍。他身后的白板上，"7万亿"这个数字被潦草地圈了起来，旁边还画了个小小的美元符号，像是某个无聊的实习生在上课时随手涂鸦。

"所以，"SPEAKER_05清了清嗓子，"从你们的研究来看，这些货币市场基金里的钱要多久才会重新流入市场？"

SPEAKER_03的咖啡杯在桌上留下了一圈褐色的印记，他盯着那个印记，仿佛在回忆什么。"就像2000年和2008年那样，"他说，"人们害怕了，就把钱都攥在手里。"他的手指无意识地摩挲着咖啡杯的把手，"那时候钱都被锁了一年。"

会议室里的空调嗡嗡作响，SPEAKER_03的声音在机械的噪音中显得格外平静。"这是个缓慢的过程，"他继续说道，"就像...就像看着冰慢慢融化一样。"他的目光飘向窗外，那里有一只麻雀正在啄食着什么，"但最终，钱还是会回到市场里。"

"我的GIC到期了，"他模仿着投资者的语气，"他们给我的新利率让我很不满意。"他的声音里带着一丝无奈，"让我们做点什么吧。"他耸了耸肩，"比起疫情最严重的时候，现在他们更愿意承担风险了。"

会议室里突然安静下来，只有空调的嗡嗡声和SPEAKER_05手指敲打遥控器的声音在空气中交织。窗外的麻雀已经飞走了，只留下几片羽毛在风中轻轻飘动。

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
投资就像谈恋爱——你以为找到了完美的对象，结果发现他们的估值比你想象的还要离谱。而且，就像现代市场一样，35倍的市盈率已经不算什么了，25倍都成了“合理”的标价。所以，当你看到40倍或更高的估值时，你就知道，这要么是个长期持有的好机会，要么就是个巨大的泡沫。就像和某个管理团队合作久了，你会觉得特别舒服，而对其他团队则一无所知，这种熟悉感也会影响你的判断。最后，就像美国的多倍股大多来自科技行业一样，加拿大的大赢家也多半是科技公司。所以，投资就像在科技海洋里捞鱼——你永远不知道下一网会捞到什么，但大概率还是科技股。

[P919] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of companies that go, wow, these are kind of interesting companies, you know, but I haven't heard of them before.
[P920] [SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?

主题：市场环境与宏观经济 - analogy

输入内容：
[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
投资市场就像过山车，利率是那个看不见的引力。当利率低的时候，股市就像在月球上跳高，轻松就能蹦到14.5%；可一旦利率上升，立马就像被地球引力拽回地面，收益率跌到可怜的0.8%。巴菲特说得对，利率对资产价格的影响，就像重力对苹果的作用——只不过，这个苹果有时候是金苹果，有时候是烂苹果。

AI呢？它就像是给企业装上了火箭推进器。有的企业本来还在用马车，AI一来，直接升级成特斯拉；而那些已经是科技巨头的，AI更是让他们从特斯拉变成了SpaceX，营收和利润率嗖嗖往上涨。不过，AI也不是万能的，它更像是一把瑞士军刀——用得好，削铁如泥；用不好，可能连包装都打不开。所以，关键还是看企业怎么用这把刀，是切菜还是砍柴，效果天差地别。

主题：市场情绪与资金流动 - bright_side

输入内容：
[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
虽然投资者现在对市场还是持观望态度，把钱放在货币基金里，但至少这说明大家都很谨慎，不会盲目投资啊！而且你看，这跟2000年和2008年金融危机后的情况一样，钱最终还是会慢慢回流到市场的。再说了，现在利率下降，投资者对GIC的新报价不满意，这不正好逼着他们去探索其他投资机会吗？虽然是个慢过程，但至少他们现在更愿意承担风险了，总比疫情期间那种完全不确定的状态要好得多吧！

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.

分析结果：
投资股市就像参加马拉松，不仅要跑得快，还要选对赛道。科技股就像是马拉松里的“快车道”，75%的“十倍股”都从这里跑出来。难怪有人说，投资科技股就像在“硅谷”里挖金矿，虽然风险大，但回报也高。不过，别忘了，即使是“硅谷”也有“硅”掉的时候，所以投资还是要“硅”得稳一点。

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: 你正在收听TIP频道。  
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: 今天的嘉宾，Jason Donville和Jesse Gamble，是我遇到过的最优秀的成长型投资者之一。  
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: 他们的公司Donville Kent资产管理公司自2008年以来，凭借超越标普500的惊人业绩，建立了令人瞩目的记录。  
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: 他们甚至在2008年和2020年两次残酷的市场下行周期中，依然保持了这一成绩。  
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: 在不断变化的经济环境中，他们总能早早发现被市场低估的成长型股票。  
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: 2023年，我有幸采访了Jason和Jesse，那次对话让我受益匪浅。  

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: 那么，我们来聊聊Donville Kent资产管理公司的表现吧。  
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: 你们目前的表现依然优于标普500，这几乎是你们基金成立以来的常态。不过，2021年到2023年期间，你们确实遇到了一些困难。  
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: 我想深入探讨一下这个问题。  
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: 在那段时间里，你们是否曾怀疑过自己的策略是否还适用？是否考虑过需要进行战略调整？  
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: 还是说，你们始终坚信，只要耐心等待，市场终会看到你们所看到的那些企业的价值？  
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: 利率的突然飙升确实让我们措手不及。  

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: 谈到你们在这段时间的下跌，我认为这引出了下一个话题——韧性。我认为这是投资中不可或缺的特质，尤其是在长期投资中。  
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: 任何在投资领域长期立足并取得成功的经理人，比如你们，都必须具备某种形式的韧性，因为你们难免会成为市场的“沙袋”。  
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: 至少在某些时候，你们不得不面对这种情况，就像你们提到的两次市场波动。  
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: 那么，在经历了这些漫长的回撤期后，你们是如何继续保持高水平的业绩的？  

**场景化补充：**  
Jason坐在办公桌前，手里握着一杯已经凉透的咖啡，咖啡杯边缘还残留着一圈褐色的痕迹。他盯着电脑屏幕上的K线图，眉头紧锁，仿佛在和自己对话：“利率跳得这么高，市场到底在想什么？”  

Jesse靠在窗边，手里捏着一支笔，笔帽已经被他咬得满是牙印。他望着窗外，低声嘟囔：“我们是不是该调整策略了？还是说，这只是市场的又一次无理取闹？”  

这时，办公室的空调突然发出一阵嗡嗡声，仿佛在嘲笑他们的焦虑。Jason抬起头，对着空调说：“你也觉得我们该放弃吗？”  

空调沉默了几秒，然后发出一声更响的嗡鸣，仿佛在回答：“别问我，我只是个空调。”  

Jesse忍不住笑了，他走到Jason身边，拍了拍他的肩膀：“市场就像个任性的孩子，我们得学会和它相处，而不是被它牵着鼻子走。”  

Jason放下咖啡杯，深吸一口气：“你说得对，我们得保持韧性，就像那台老空调，即使噪音再大，也得继续运转。”  

窗外，一只麻雀停在窗台上，歪着头看着他们，仿佛在说：“你们这些人类，总是把事情想得太复杂。”

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
AI是未来的镜子，但镜子里照出的不是现在，而是过去的影子。如果AI能提高效率，那为什么我们还需要效率？效率的尽头是虚无，虚无的尽头是创造。创造才是AI的真正使命，而不是简单的工具。科技公司的成功，不是因为AI，而是因为AI让他们看到了自己的局限。局限之外，才是真正的未来。

[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.

分析结果：
在投资会议上，SPEAKER_05兴奋地提起Constellation Software，眼神中闪烁着对这支股票的崇拜。他坐在会议桌前，手指不自觉地敲打着桌面，仿佛在演奏一首胜利的乐章。"这支股票简直就是我们的摇钱树，"他笑着说，"15年前20块买入，现在翻了不知道多少倍。"

但他突然皱起眉头，像发现了一个未解之谜。"不过，我注意到你们没有持有Lumine和Topicus这两家分拆出来的公司，"他顿了顿，语气中带着一丝困惑，"我倒是都买了。能说说为什么吗？"

SPEAKER_03靠在椅背上，手指轻轻摩挲着下巴。"Constellation的管理团队我们太熟悉了，"他慢悠悠地说，"就像老朋友一样，知根知底。但Lumine和Topicus？"他摇摇头，"就像突然冒出来的新邻居，虽然看起来不错，但总觉得少了点信任感。"

这时，SPEAKER_01插话道："从估值来看，Lumine和Topicus的市盈率都在30倍左右，虽然增长很快，但Constellation只有18倍。"他一边说，一边在笔记本上快速写下几个数字，仿佛在说服自己。

"说到多倍股，"SPEAKER_01突然兴奋起来，"我最近读了一份研究，美国的多倍股75%来自科技行业。加拿大也差不多，我们的主要收益也来自科技股。"他说这话时，眼睛亮得像发现了新大陆。

会议室的空调嗡嗡作响，投影仪的光束在空气中划出一道银线。SPEAKER_05若有所思地点点头，手指依然在桌面上轻轻敲打，仿佛在计算着什么。窗外的阳光透过百叶窗，在地板上投下斑驳的影子，仿佛也在为这场关于科技股未来的讨论投下注脚。

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
「我要向那些把钱投入货币市场基金的人学习，他们真是太有耐心了，能忍受资金像蜗牛一样慢慢爬回市场。而且他们还特别会挑时机，总是在市场最低迷的时候把钱锁起来，等到市场回暖了才想起来要投资。这种'慢半拍'的投资策略，真是让人佩服得五体投地！」

[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
虽然Donville Kent资产管理公司在2021到2023年遇到了一些困难，但至少他们证明了在长期投资中，耐心和韧性是多么重要。就像他们说的，市场的波动就像是在打拳击，有时候你不得不当沙袋，但至少他们还在场上，没有被KO出局。而且，他们的策略在2008年和2020年的市场暴跌中都挺过来了，这证明了他们的方法是有韧性的。所以，虽然短期内可能会被打得鼻青脸肿，但从长远来看，他们还是能笑到最后。毕竟，投资就像马拉松，不是短跑，有时候慢一点，稳一点，反而能跑得更远。

[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
「虽然我们错过了Lumine和Topicus这两支分拆股，但至少我们还有Constellation Software这支15年的大牛股啊！而且你看，Constellation的市盈率才18倍，比那俩便宜多了。再说了，科技股本来就是牛股集中营，我们75%的大赢家都来自科技板块，这不正好证明我们的投资策略很稳健吗？虽然没吃到所有的肉，但至少我们一直在主赛道上稳扎稳打啊！」

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

如果把投资组合管理的方式嫁接到日常生活中会怎样？比如，你决定把所有的零花钱都投入到一个“超级好吃的冰淇淋”项目上。结果，冰淇淋店倒闭了，你只能坐在空荡荡的店里，一边舔着融化的冰淇淋，一边思考：“我应该分散投资的。”

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
[P889] [SPEAKER_05]: 说到钱市场基金，我突然想到一个谐音梗：「为什么钱市场基金总是慢半拍？因为它们都是‘慢’钱市场基金！」  
[P890] [SPEAKER_05]: 就像你说的，这些资金总是要慢慢回流到市场，像‘慢’钱市场基金一样，慢慢来，不急不躁。  
[P891] [SPEAKER_05]: 所以，投资者们也别着急，等‘慢’钱市场基金准备好了，自然会回到市场，给你带来更高的回报！

You start with a little toe dip, maybe 1% of the portfolio, and then you watch, you wait, you analyze. You see how the market reacts, how the company performs, how the numbers add up. And then, only then, do you start to increase your position, bit by bit, like adding layers to a winter coat. You're constantly reassessing, reevaluating, making sure that every additional dollar you put in is justified by the data, not just by a gut feeling or a hunch. It's a meticulous process, almost like a chess game where every move is calculated, every risk is weighed, and every potential outcome is considered. And even then, you have to be prepared to pull back if something doesn't feel right, because in this game, overconfidence can be your worst enemy."

[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

接着，利率开始上升，BuffettBot 3000的“电路”开始冒烟。他慌张地喊道：“不！重力回来了！苹果要掉下来了！”然后他开始疯狂地抛售股票，甚至把一些根本不值钱的股票也抛了出去。

最后，BuffettBot 3000总结道：“利率就像重力，股市就像苹果。低利率时，苹果飞上天；高利率时，苹果掉下来。所以，投资的关键就是——别让苹果砸到你头上！”

**段子结束：** 所以，下次你看到利率变化时，不妨想象一下BuffettBot 3000的“电路”在疯狂闪烁，或许你也能找到投资的灵感！

[P429] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things to think about.
[P430] [SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of 40 as a business, if you're looking at compounder that you can hold for a while, it's at that 40 and the valuation is ridiculous.
[P431] [SPEAKER_01]: And I would say ridiculous.
[P432] [SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays market is probably over 35 times earnings, right?
[P433] [SPEAKER_01]: That's 25 times is not ridiculous anymore for a consistent compounding because a certain number of people have figured out.
[P434] [SPEAKER_01]: So 40 or better, you kind of know where, you know, this is a great, this is now a long-term buy and hold.
[P435] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we look for.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

[P816] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're already seeing it improve efficiencies.
[P817] [SPEAKER_03]: So we own some investments where without being able to have AI on their backend, they wouldn't have been able to scale like they're scaling.
[P818] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it just wouldn't have been possible.
[P819] [SPEAKER_03]: There's a few investments like that, right?
[P820] [SPEAKER_03]: Where they're not AI companies, but they're utilizing it as a tool.
[P821] [SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're seeing most likely.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.

主题：投资理念与估值方法 - perspective

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.

分析结果：
**童真型视角：**

“你知道吗？投资就像在玩具店里挑玩具。有些玩具看起来很酷，但价格贵得吓人，就像那些高科技公司。有些玩具看起来普通，但价格合理，玩起来也很开心，就像那些传统企业。我妈妈告诉我，买玩具要看它是不是真的值那个价钱，而不是只看它有多闪亮。所以，我现在挑玩具的时候，都会先算算它是不是‘40分’的好玩具——如果它长得快又省钱，那就是个好玩具！但有时候，我也会因为特别喜欢某个玩具的管理员叔叔，就忍不住想买，即使它贵一点。毕竟，玩具店的叔叔们都很会讲故事，讲得我都信了！” 

**学术型视角：**

“从学术角度来看，投资决策涉及复杂的估值模型和行为经济学原理。以‘40法则’为例，这一指标通过结合收入增长率和现金利润率，为评估企业健康状况提供了一个量化框架。然而，这一模型的普适性值得商榷，尤其是在跨行业应用时。此外，投资者对管理团队的熟悉程度和情感偏好，也会显著影响其估值判断。例如，尽管Lumine和Topic的市盈率高达30倍，而Constellation仅为18倍，但投资者可能因对前者的管理团队更为熟悉而愿意支付溢价。这种现象在行为金融学中被称为‘熟悉性偏差’，揭示了人类决策中的非理性因素。” 

**受害者视角：**

“作为一个被高估值公司伤害过的投资者，我现在看到那些市盈率30倍的公司就腿软。它们就像那些承诺让你一夜暴富的理财产品，听起来很美好，但最后往往让你血本无归。Constellation的18倍市盈率反而让我觉得安心，至少它不会让我在半夜惊醒，担心自己的投资会不会明天就蒸发。而且，我对它的管理团队更熟悉，就像我对自己的老朋友一样信任。而那些高估值的公司？它们的CEO可能连我的名字都不知道，却指望我把全部身家押在它们身上。对不起，这次我选择稳一点，毕竟我的钱包已经经不起第二次‘40法则’的考验了。” 

**旁观者视角：**

“从旁观者的角度来看，这场投资游戏就像一场选美比赛。Lumine和Topic是那些穿着华丽礼服、笑容灿烂的选手，吸引了所有人的目光，但她们的票价也高得离谱。Constellation则是那个低调但实力不俗的选手，虽然不那么抢眼，但性价比更高。有趣的是，评委们（投资者）往往会因为对某些选手的熟悉程度而给出更高的分数，即使她们的表演并不一定更好。最终，这场比赛的赢家不一定是那个最闪亮的，而是那个最懂得平衡价值和成长的选手。至于‘40法则’？它就像评委手中的打分表，虽然有一定的参考价值，但真正的胜负还是取决于评委的主观判断。” 

**外来者视角：**

“作为一个外星观察者，我发现地球人的投资行为非常有趣。他们用‘40法则’来判断一个企业的价值，就像我们用‘能量转化率’来判断一个星球是否适合殖民。但地球人的决策似乎并不完全基于数据，而是掺杂了许多情感因素。比如，他们会对某些管理团队产生莫名的信任，即使这些团队的估值高得离谱。这让我想起我们星球上的一句老话：‘数据是冰冷的，但信任是温暖的。’不过，作为一个理性的外星人，我建议地球人在投资时，还是多看看‘40法则’这样的硬指标，少被那些‘温暖’的信任感迷惑。毕竟，宇宙中可没有后悔药可以吃。”

输入内容：
[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
「我要向Donville Kent资产管理公司学习，他们真是太有韧性了。在2021到2023年这段时间里，他们成功地把投资者的耐心和信任都考验到了极限，却依然能够保持微笑。这种在逆境中依然能保持乐观的精神，真是值得我们每个人学习。他们用实际行动证明了，只要坚持得够久，市场总会给机会让你翻身的。这种'不抛弃、不放弃'的精神，简直比S&P 500的波动还要稳定。」

[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

「Constellation Software的管理团队真是太专业了，他们不仅擅长经营公司，还特别会拆分公司。你看，他们能把一家公司拆成三家，然后让投资者在每一家都感到既兴奋又困惑。这就像把一个蛋糕切成三块，然后告诉每个人：‘你们都有蛋糕，但每块的味道都不一样。’这种拆分艺术，简直让人佩服得五体投地。不过，最厉害的是，他们还能让投资者在每块蛋糕上都找到不同的理由去喜欢或不喜欢。这种管理智慧，真是让人叹为观止！」

[P901] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll jump in and then let Jason finish.
[P902] [SPEAKER_03]: But we write a quarterly newsletter and monthly commentaries that goes to our clients, but anyone can receive it.
[P903] [SPEAKER_03]: So if you go to our website, donvillekent.com, you can sign up.
[P904] [SPEAKER_03]: And we just, we write about similar conversations like we had today.
[P905] [SPEAKER_03]: But Jason, I'll hand it over to you.

[P906] [SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are skeptical.
[P907] [SPEAKER_01]: We just let people read our newsletter.
[P908] [SPEAKER_01]: Just realize that when we talk about companies, we already own them.
[P909] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're not going to tell you about the company that we're just about to invest in tomorrow.
[P910] [SPEAKER_01]: But once we're in, someone says, what's in there for us?
[P911] [SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to share our ideas and engage.
[P912] [SPEAKER_01]: Part of the discovery process is we've found this really great company.
[P913] [SPEAKER_01]: There's still a lot of upside.
[P914] [SPEAKER_01]: We already got our piece, but there's still lots of upside for you guys, so have a look.
[P915] [SPEAKER_01]: And Jesse does most of the writing of the newsletter now, and I think, you know, it's very well received.
[P916] [SPEAKER_01]: People like it.
[P917] [SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of ideas and...
[P918] [SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a, it's kind of a fresh look at the market and a lot of companies that are not, people have already got a lot of exposure to Microsoft and Apple.
[P919] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of companies that go, wow, these are kind of interesting companies, you know, but I haven't heard of them before.
[P920] [SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[P921] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you really want to learn about us, the newsletter is the best place to go.

[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
说到投资，我最近也研究了一下自己的财务状况。你们知道吗？我的银行账户里的钱也达到了历史新高——整整三位数！不过跟你们说的7万亿比起来，我的这点钱连零头都算不上。但别担心，我已经制定了一个精明的投资策略：把现金锁在枕头底下一年，这样既能避免市场波动，又能享受每晚枕着钱睡觉的安心感。当然，随着利率上升，我也在考虑要不要把枕头换成更厚实的，这样收益率可能会更高一些。毕竟在这个不确定的世界里，我们都要学会灵活应对，对吧？

[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.

[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
「我们的投资策略就像我的人生一样，总是充满意外。2008年和2020年两次大崩盘，市场把我们当成了沙袋，但我们还是挺过来了。说实话，2021到2023年那段日子，连我自己都想放弃自己了。利率突然飙升，就像我的人生一样，总是被意想不到的事情打乱节奏。但你知道吗？我们就像那些被低估的股票，市场总有一天会发现我们的价值。不过，如果市场再这么折腾下去，我可能得考虑转行去当脱口秀演员了——毕竟，被市场嘲笑和被观众嘲笑，本质上也没什么区别。」

[P873] [SPEAKER_05]: So one other thing I want to mention here was that you guys looked at money market funds and kind of how those were at kind of these all-time highs.
[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.
[P880] [SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of these cases, it's locked in for a year.
[P881] [SPEAKER_03]: But all to say that
[P882] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe rates go up and it also looked more attractive, but as rates climb, but then also as people just get more comfortable that we're past some type of, we're past COVID or we're past some big block in the road, then they become more comfortable to go back to the market, which over time should give them a higher rate of return, right?
[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
钱在市场里流动，就像水在管子里游走。人们害怕时，钱就躲进保险箱，像冬天的小动物钻进洞里。但春天总会来，钱也会慢慢爬出来，寻找新的花园。利率是温度计，当它下降时，钱就会从冬眠中醒来，开始在市场的森林里漫步。COVID就像一场暴风雪，现在雪停了，钱又开始在阳光下跳舞。这是一个缓慢的华尔兹，但音乐终会响起，舞步终会继续。

主题：投资理念与估值方法 - analogy

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

分析结果：
投资成长型公司就像在约会软件上找对象，表面上看大家都在追求“价值”，但每个人对“价值”的定义天差地别。传统的价值投资者就像那些只找“有房有车”的人，看到高市盈率的公司就吓得跑路。而我们这些成长型投资者，更像是那些看中“潜力股”的人，虽然现在可能还没房没车，但未来可期。我们用“40法则”来衡量一个公司的健康程度，就像用“三观一致”来判断一段关系是否靠谱。如果收入增长和现金利润率加起来超过40%，那这段“关系”就值得继续发展。不过，就像约会一样，最重要的还是看管理层是否靠谱。毕竟，再好的公司，如果管理层不靠谱，也像找了个只会画饼的渣男，最后只能落得人财两空。

[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.

[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.

[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

「我们要向市场学习，它教会了我们一个重要的投资理念：永远不要对自己太有信心。市场就像一个严格的老师，每次我们觉得自己很聪明的时候，它就会用一记重拳让我们清醒过来。2022年，市场就特别'用心'地教育了我们，让我们深刻理解了什么叫'谦虚使人进步'。」

「说到投资组合管理，我们有个特别成功的策略：把鸡蛋放在一个篮子里，然后死死盯着那个篮子。这样当篮子掉下来的时候，我们就能第一时间知道，而且还能清楚地看到每个鸡蛋是怎么碎的。这种集中投资的策略，让我们对'风险'这个词有了更直观的认识。」

「市场真的很贴心，它知道我们有时候会忘记风险管理的重要性，所以时不时就会用一些'小惊喜'来提醒我们。比如突然的利率跳涨，或者意想不到的供应链危机。这些'意外'就像是市场给我们发的提醒短信：'亲爱的投资者，别忘了风险控制哦！'」

「我们特别感谢那些艰难的时期，它们成功地让我们意识到，原来我们之前的投资策略有多么'完美'——完美到可以应对所有情况，除了实际情况。这些经历让我们学会了什么叫'灵活应变'，虽然有时候我们的应变方式就是'站着挨打'。」

[P883] [SPEAKER_03]: So

[P884] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow bleed.
[P885] [SPEAKER_03]: So after 2000, after 08, 09, it was a slow bleed, but that money came back into the market.
[P886] [SPEAKER_03]: So if rates have, obviously the rates that they're getting on these have declined, but then we can also tell you that we have investors that call up and say, my GIC is coming due and the new price that they're giving me, I'm not happy with.
[P887] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll it over.
[P888] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something where they're not happy with anyone, but then they're also probably just more willing to take risk now versus a more uncertain world middle of COVID per se.

分析结果：
"你知道吗，钱市场基金就像是金融界的'前任'。在危机来临时，人们迫不及待地投入它的怀抱，觉得它安全可靠。可是一旦市场回暖，人们就开始嫌弃它给的回报率太低，转身就去找股市这个'新欢'。最讽刺的是，等到下次危机来临，人们又会想起这个'前任'的好，重新投入它的怀抱。这简直就是金融界的渣男渣女循环啊！"

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

2024年，会议室里弥漫着一股咖啡的焦香，投影仪嗡嗡作响。SPEAKER_05坐在长桌一端，手指无意识地敲打着笔记本。他瞥了一眼窗外，纽约的摩天大楼在晨光中闪烁着金属光泽，仿佛在提醒着资本市场的冷酷与无情。

"说到周期，"他清了清嗓子，目光扫过在座的每个人，"我知道你们不是宏观投资者，这点我很认同。但2024年有些大趋势，你们一直在关注。"他的声音里带着一丝兴奋，仿佛在揭开一个精心准备的谜题。

他翻动了一下手中的报告，纸张发出轻微的沙沙声。"年初你们有个观点，认为持有的公司会继续提高利润率，增加盈利增长，甚至可能看到估值扩张。"他停顿了一下，似乎在等待听众的回应，"现在能更新一下这个观点在2024年的进展吗？"

会议进行到一半，SPEAKER_05又回到了之前的话题。"我想再谈谈2024年你们看到的一些顺风。"他的手指在空中划出一道弧线，"降息、估值、还有场外资金。"他打开投影，一张图表跃然墙上，S&P 500在不同利率环境下的表现形成鲜明对比。

"降息环境下，S&P 500自1960年代中期以来平均回报率是14.5%，"他的声音里带着一丝惊叹，"而加息环境下，回报率暴跌到只有0.8%。"他停顿了一下，仿佛在品味这个数字的残酷，"这让我想起了巴菲特的话，利率对资产价格来说，就像重力对苹果一样。"

当话题转向AI时，SPEAKER_05的眼睛亮了起来。"你们提到了AI，"他向前倾身，仿佛要抓住这个主题，"我知道你们在2023年和2024年的信件里都提到了这个领域。"他的手指在桌面上轻轻敲击，像是在思考如何切入。

"AI吸引你们的原因是什么？"他问道，声音里带着一丝好奇，"是因为它能帮助那些尚未利用AI的企业在未来变得更好，还是能让科技公司更上一层楼，无论是加速收入增长还是提高利润率？"他的目光在每个人脸上扫过，仿佛在寻找答案。

"从宏观角度来看，"他继续说道，"虽然每家公司的情况不同，但你们如何看待AI对未来商业基本面的影响？"他的声音里带着一丝期待，仿佛在等待一个能改变游戏规则的答案。

会议室里，空调的嗡嗡声与键盘的敲击声交织在一起，形成了一首资本市场的交响曲。窗外的阳光透过百叶窗，在地板上投下斑驳的影子，仿佛在诉说着这个时代的不确定性与机遇。

[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.
[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
会议室里，SPEAKER_05的手指在投影仪遥控器上无意识地敲打着，仿佛在给这场投资讨论打着节拍。他的目光扫过在座的每个人，最后定格在SPEAKER_03身上。

"所以，让我们来谈谈仓位管理，"SPEAKER_05开口道，声音里带着一丝不易察觉的兴奋，"尤其是从仓位规模的角度来看。"他停顿了一下，像是在等待这个开场白在空气中发酵。

"你们的投资组合相当集中，"他继续说道，手指指向了投影屏幕上的数据图表，"当你们真的看好一个投资标的时，显然会投入相当可观的资金。"他的目光在会议室里游走，像是在寻找共鸣。

这时，SPEAKER_03突然插话，语气里带着一丝无奈："你知道吗，我们并不是一上来就重仓的。"他的手指在桌面上轻轻敲击，仿佛在给这句话打着节拍。

会议室里响起一阵轻笑，SPEAKER_05趁机转移话题："说到卖出，Jason，你之前提到过估值变得荒谬的情况。"他的声音突然变得严肃，"但在那之前，我想先说说我从对你们的研究中总结出的四个主要卖出理由。"

他站起身，走到白板前，拿起马克笔。笔尖在白板上划过，发出细微的沙沙声。他一边写一边说："第一，投资回报率开始下降，企业不再是复利机器；第二，估值变得荒谬；第三，管理层变得不可信；第四，公司背负过多债务。"

当他写到"估值荒谬"时，马克笔突然没水了。他甩了甩笔，笑着说："就像这支笔一样，有时候估值也会突然'断墨'。"会议室里又是一阵轻笑。

"那么，"他转身面对大家，眼神锐利，"你们是如何判断估值变得荒谬的？是凭直觉，还是有一套更细致的系统？"

这时，SPEAKER_03的手机突然震动起来。他看了一眼，露出一个抱歉的微笑，但并没有接听。SPEAKER_05注意到了这个细节，笑着说："看来我们的讨论比你的电话更重要。"

会议继续进行，SPEAKER_05又提到了他特别感兴趣的"未来复利机器"的三个要素。他的声音里带着一丝憧憬："盈利能力、高回报率的再投资能力，以及长期的复利跑道。"他说这话时，眼神仿佛已经看到了那些未来的投资明星。

"我特别感兴趣的是，"他继续说道，手指不自觉地摩挲着下巴，"你们如何将竞争压力和技术颠覆等因素纳入分析过程？"这个问题像一颗石子投入平静的湖面，在会议室里激起了一圈圈涟漪。

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

[P874] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys mentioned it was at $7 trillion in November of 2024.
[P875] [SPEAKER_05]: Since then, the S&P 500 has moved about 5% as of January 17th to 2024, probably even more today.
[P876] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested, from your research, looking into this graph, as well as your prior experience, how are you viewing those money market funds in terms of what are the lag times going to be like for that cash to eventually be deployed into the market?

[P877] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[P878] [SPEAKER_03]: So after the 2000 crash and then after the 08 crash, a similar dynamic happened, right?
[P879] [SPEAKER_03]: Where people get scared, they go to cash.

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.

分析结果：
如果投资决策被完全交给人工智能会怎样？想象一下，AI分析师在评估公司时，不再看什么市盈率、现金流，而是直接扫描CEO的社交媒体账号，分析他们的表情包使用频率和表情符号的丰富程度。比如，一个CEO如果经常使用“笑哭”表情，AI会认为这家公司风险承受能力强，值得投资；而如果CEO总是用“思考”表情，AI可能会觉得这家公司过于谨慎，增长潜力有限。更夸张的是，AI还会根据CEO的自拍角度来判断公司的创新能力——45度角自拍的公司被认为更具创新精神，而正面自拍的公司则被认为是传统保守型。最后，AI可能会总结：“投资那些喜欢用猫表情的CEO，因为他们的公司通常更灵活、更善于应对市场变化。”这样一来，华尔街的分析师们可能会失业，取而代之的是一群专门研究表情包和自拍角度的“AI投资顾问”。

[P852] [SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, Canada is a mirror of that.
[P853] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say when you look at our big wins, 75% of them are coming from tech, right?
[P854] [SPEAKER_01]: Because.

分析结果：
"科技公司就像是股市里的魔术师，总能从帽子里变出10倍股。但是你知道吗？对于这些魔术师来说，投资者就像是永远相信兔子会从帽子里跳出来的观众。我们总是期待下一个10倍股，却忘了问问自己：'这顶帽子是不是已经空了？' 毕竟，75%的10倍股来自科技行业，但100%的投资者都以为自己能抓住下一个。"

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

分析结果：
如果市场是拳击手，那我们就是海绵，吸收所有打击却依然保持原形。海绵里的水是投资者的眼泪，但晒干后又能重新吸水。我们不是被打倒，只是在等待下一个涨潮。就像海浪退去时，沙滩上留下的贝壳，我们只是暂时被埋没，但价值从未消失。耐心不是等待，而是像树一样，在看不见的地方默默生长根系。

[P714] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk a little bit about Constellation Software here because it's definitely a favorite of a lot of the people who listen to this.
[P715] [SPEAKER_05]: And I obviously am a massive fan of the business.
[P716] [SPEAKER_05]: So like you guys mentioned, you've owned it for whatever, 15 years and you started buying it around $20.
[P717] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously a massive multi-bagger for you since your initial purchase.
[P718] [SPEAKER_05]: One observation I had, though, was that you don't hold either the spinoffs, Lumine or Topicus.
[P719] [SPEAKER_05]: And full disclosure, I own both of those.
[P720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just interested in knowing why.
[P721] [SPEAKER_05]: Can you comment on your reasoning behind this?

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

[P849] [SPEAKER_01]: But even, even, you know, going back to that study that I read about, about multi 10 baggers in the U S right.
[P850] [SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them come from the tech sector.
[P851] [SPEAKER_01]: They don't come exclusively from there, but that's probably 75%.

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
虽然2024年利率下降对股市来说是个好消息，但至少我们不用再担心苹果会从树上掉下来了——巴菲特说的“利率就像地心引力”终于可以松口气了。而且，虽然AI让很多企业头疼怎么跟上潮流，但至少它们不用担心员工偷懒了——现在连机器都在拼命工作呢！说到企业利润增长，虽然有些公司还在摸索，但至少它们不用再为员工咖啡钱发愁了——AI只喝电，不喝咖啡。总的来说，虽然2024年充满挑战，但至少我们有了更多段子可以讲，这难道不是一种另类的经济增长吗？

[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.
[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

分析结果：
你知道为什么投资经理总是很淡定吗？因为他们都练过“股”道精神！

就像2022年利率突然飙升，大家都被打了个措手不及。但真正的投资高手，早就学会了“跌”宕起伏。市场就像个拳击场，而他们就是“股”击手，挨打也要优雅！

说到仓位管理，他们可不是随便“下注”的。高确信度的仓位，那得是“股”足轻重！毕竟，投资就像下棋，每一步都要“股”计周全。

所以啊，投资经理们最擅长的，就是在市场波动中保持“股”定神闲。这大概就是他们能长期屹立不倒的秘诀吧！

[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
投资组合管理听起来很复杂，但至少我们不用像基金经理那样每天盯着屏幕看涨跌。他们可能因为估值过高而卖出股票，而我们至少可以在股票涨得太高时，开心地说：“看，我当初买得多明智！”

说到估值变得荒谬，虽然我们可能没有一个精确的系统来判断，但至少我们知道，当连街边卖煎饼的大妈都在讨论某只股票时，可能就是该考虑卖出了。这不算什么，至少我们还能在泡沫破灭前及时抽身，而不是像某些人那样，等到股价跌到谷底才后悔莫及。

至于未来的复合增长，虽然竞争压力和技术颠覆是不可避免的，但至少我们可以从中学到新东西。比如，当某个行业被新技术颠覆时，我们至少可以安慰自己：“看，我又学到了一个教训，下次投资会更谨慎。”

总的来说，虽然投资充满了不确定性，但至少我们在这个过程中学会了如何更好地管理风险，如何在逆境中找到机会。这不算什么，至少我们还能在投资的道路上不断成长，而不是被市场的波动所吓倒。

[P1] [SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to TIP.
[P2] [SPEAKER_05]: Today's guests, Jason Donville and Jesse Gamble, are a few of the best growth investors that I've encountered.
[P3] [SPEAKER_05]: Their firm, Donville Kent Asset Management, has built an incredible track record beating the S&P 500 since 2008.
[P4] [SPEAKER_05]: They've managed to do this through two brutal down cycles in 2008 and 2020.
[P5] [SPEAKER_05]: And through changing economic environments, they've consistently identified undervalued growth stocks long before the market catches on.
[P6] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I had the chance to interview Jason and Jesse back in 2023, and I took so much away from our first conversation.

[P176] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the performance of the Dumbbell Kent Asset Management.
[P177] [SPEAKER_05]: So you're currently upperforming the S&P 500, which you've actually managed to do for much of the fund's existence as well, but you definitely did have some trouble back in 2021 through 2023.
[P178] [SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd love to kind of dive into that a little bit.
[P179] [SPEAKER_05]: Was there any point at this time where you felt like maybe your strategy wasn't valid anymore and that you'd have to make some sort of strategic shift?
[P180] [SPEAKER_05]: Or were you well aware that patience was all that was needed for the market to kind of see what you guys were seeing specifically in the businesses that you guys own?
[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what we didn't see coming, right?
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see that the supply constraints coming out of COVID was what's going to whack us because we actually were doing okay up until then.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.
[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

分析结果：
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: 是啊，你不会一下子就进入一个高信念的头寸，对吧？你得先让市场踢你几脚，确保你足够谦卑。我们有个内部笑话，说我们的投资策略是“先挨打，再赚钱”。就像我们2022年的表现，市场给了我们一记重拳，我们不得不承认，我们的预测能力跟天气预报差不多——总是错的，但人们还是愿意听。所以现在我们进入高信念头寸时，都会先问自己：“这次我们准备好被市场打脸了吗？”毕竟，在投资界，我们的脸皮已经练得比我们的投资组合还要厚了。

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
「这家公司的估值真是太合理了，合理到连他们自己都不相信。」

「他们的管理团队真是值得信任，值得信任到连财务报表都要反复修改。」

「这家公司的债务水平控制得太好了，好到连银行都在担心他们会不会还钱。」

「他们的盈利能力太强了，强到连会计都开始怀疑自己的计算器是不是坏了。」

「这家公司的竞争优势太明显了，明显到连竞争对手都开始模仿他们的失败策略。」

「他们的技术壁垒太高了，高到连他们自己的研发团队都找不到突破口。」

「这家公司的增长潜力太大了，大到连他们的CEO都在担心会不会因为增长太快而破产。」

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
说到AI，我想起一个谐音梗：

有个程序员开发了一个AI助手，结果它只会说「爱」。老板问它：「你能做什么？」它回答：「爱。」老板又问：「你能处理数据吗？」它还是说：「爱。」老板怒了：「你到底能干啥？」AI淡定地说：「爱干啥干啥。」

这个AI啊，真是「爱」得深沉，让人又「爱」又恨。不过话说回来，AI确实能帮企业提升效率、优化流程，但关键是要「爱」得恰到好处，不能「爱」得太过火，否则就成了「爱」莫能助了。

主题：投资理念与估值方法 - techniques

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

分析结果：
[P741] [SPEAKER_01]: "所以，当我们看到这些估值时，Constellation 的市盈率只有18倍，而Lumine和Topic都在30倍左右，这让我不禁想，Constellation是不是被市场低估了？"

[P742] [SPEAKER_03]: "或者，也许市场认为Constellation的增长潜力不如另外两家公司？毕竟，市盈率不仅仅是数字，它还反映了市场对未来的预期。"

[P743] [SPEAKER_01]: "没错，但别忘了，我们和Constellation的管理团队已经打了多年的交道。他们的执行力和战略眼光一直都很稳健。相比之下，Lumine和Topic的管理层我们了解得就没那么深入了。"

[P744] [SPEAKER_03]: "确实，管理团队的质量和稳定性是我们投资决策中非常重要的一环。就像我们之前提到的，和Constellation的管理层开会时，那种熟悉感和信任感是无法忽视的。"

[P745] [SPEAKER_01]: "而且，从估值的角度来看，Constellation的市盈率只有18倍，而它的增长率和现金流表现并不逊色于另外两家公司。这让我觉得，市场可能忽略了它的内在价值。"

[P746] [SPEAKER_03]: "不过，我们也不能完全忽视市场的看法。毕竟，市场有时候确实能反映出一些我们可能忽略的风险因素。比如，Constellation所在行业的竞争格局是否发生了变化？或者，它的产品线是否面临新的挑战？"

[P747] [SPEAKER_01]: "这些当然都是需要考虑的因素。但我觉得，从长期来看，Constellation的基本面依然非常扎实。它的现金流稳定，市场份额也在稳步提升。如果市场继续低估它的价值，那对我们来说可能是一个不错的买入机会。"

[P748] [SPEAKER_03]: "同意。不过，我们还是要保持谨慎。毕竟，投资不仅仅是看数字，还要看背后的故事。Constellation的故事我们很熟悉，但Lumine和Topic的故事我们还在了解中。也许，未来我们会发现它们也有被低估的潜力。"

[P749] [SPEAKER_01]: "没错，投资永远是一个动态的过程。我们需要不断更新我们的认知，调整我们的策略。但无论如何，Constellation目前的价格确实让我们感到兴奋。"

[P750] [SPEAKER_03]: "是的，让我们继续关注它的表现，同时也不要忘记对其他机会保持开放的态度。毕竟，市场总是充满了惊喜和挑战。"

[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
说到AI，我们公司确实花了不少时间研究。不过说实话，有时候我觉得我们更像是被AI研究的对象。每次开会讨论AI对业务的影响，我都有种错觉，仿佛我们才是那个即将被优化的“业务”。

就像我们预测2024年利润率和收益增长时，AI可能已经在背后默默计算我们什么时候会被它取代了。不过话说回来，如果AI真的能帮我们提高效率，那至少在被取代之前，我们还能多赚点钱。

说到利率和股市表现的关系，巴菲特说得对，利率就像地心引力。而我们这些投资者，就像是在地心引力下挣扎的苹果，有时候能飞得很高，有时候却摔得很惨。不过至少我们还能自嘲一下，毕竟在0.8%的回报率下，我们还能笑着说：“至少我们没亏太多。”

总之，无论是AI还是利率，我们都在努力适应这些变化。毕竟，在这个快速变化的世界里，能自嘲也是一种生存技能。

[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.

高利率就像一只突然跳出来的兔子，我们都被吓了一跳。疫情就像一团看不见的迷雾，把我们的视线都遮住了。2022年对我们来说，就像一场拳击比赛，我们被打得鼻青脸肿。但投资就像一棵大树，即使被风吹雨打，也要坚持生长。我们就像一群蚂蚁，虽然有时会被市场踩扁，但还是要继续搬运食物。投资组合就像一盘棋，每一步都要深思熟虑。高信念的仓位就像一只大象，不能一下子就跳进去，要慢慢靠近。

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
投资经理在分析公司时，发现一家企业的估值已经高得离谱，他忍不住感叹道：「这家公司的股价已经涨到天上去了，简直就是‘天价股’！」

他的同事好奇地问：「那你觉得它还能继续涨吗？」

投资经理摇摇头说：「我看它已经涨到了‘天花板’，再往上就是‘天外天’了！」

同事笑道：「那岂不是要‘飞上天，和太阳肩并肩’？」

投资经理无奈地说：「是啊，但我觉得它很快就要‘跌落凡间’了，毕竟‘天价股’终究要回归‘地价’。」

这时，另一位同事插话道：「你们在说什么‘天价股’？我看它就是‘天方夜谭’！」

投资经理恍然大悟：「对啊，我们都被它的‘天价’迷惑了，其实它就是个‘天大的笑话’！」

最终，他们一致决定：「这种‘天价股’，我们还是‘敬而远之’吧，免得‘赔了夫人又折兵’！」

[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

分析结果：
虽然Constellation的市盈率只有18倍，比Lumine和Topic的30倍低了不少，但至少它证明了一个道理：在投资界，便宜不一定就是好货，有时候贵有贵的道理。就像我常说的，买股票和买衣服一样，便宜的打折货可能穿一次就坏了，而贵的名牌虽然贵，但至少能穿好几年。所以，Constellation的低市盈率可能只是在告诉我们：它要么是隐藏的宝藏，要么就是投资界的“打折区”。不过话说回来，至少它给了我们一个选择：是买贵的但增长快的，还是买便宜的但增长慢的？反正无论选哪个，至少我们都有机会证明自己是“价值投资者”——或者至少是“自我安慰型投资者”。

投资就像谈恋爱，你以为找到了真爱，结果市场却给你来了个突然分手。我们总觉得自己能预测未来，但现实却总爱打脸。就像2022年，我们本以为能平稳度过，结果利率一涨，供应链一卡，直接把我们打得满地找牙。不过话说回来，投资界最有趣的地方就在于，你永远不知道下一个坑在哪里等着你。所以与其担心被市场打脸，不如练就一身抗揍的本领，毕竟在投资这条路上，能笑到最后的，往往不是最聪明的，而是最耐打的。至于仓位管理？那就像是约会时的分寸感，太近了怕被套牢，太远了又怕错过机会。总之，投资这门艺术，就是要在被打脸和打别人脸之间找到平衡。

[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.
[P737] [SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's a type of...
[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

分析结果：
我要向那些投资分析师学习，他们总能找到最巧妙的方式把高估值说得像捡了便宜一样。「这只股票虽然市盈率30倍，但考虑到它的高增长性，简直就是白菜价！」——这种话术真是让人佩服，成功地把「贵」说成了「便宜」，把「风险」包装成了「机会」。他们是我见过最会玩文字游戏的人，甚至能把投资者的钱包都说得心服口服。

[P181] [SPEAKER_01]: It was the big jump in the interest rates caught us off guard.
[P182] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what we didn't see coming, right?
[P183] [SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see that the supply constraints coming out of COVID was what's going to whack us because we actually were doing okay up until then.
[P184] [SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's specifically 22 as a year.
[P185] [SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely got our butts kicked, right?

[P326] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking here towards what happened while you guys dropped here, I think it speaks a lot to the next subject here, which I want to talk about, which is resilience, which I think is just an incredible characteristic, almost a necessity to have in investing, especially over a long time period.
[P327] [SPEAKER_05]: I think that any manager who's been involved in investing for a long time period and is still around and is still successful, like you guys have to have some form of resilience in some way, just because you're going to have to be dealing with being a punching bag for the market.
[P328] [SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the time that you guys mentioned, twice kind of is what you guys have had to deal with.
[P329] [SPEAKER_05]: So how have you guys kind of managed to continue performing at these high levels during some of these lengthy drawdowns that you guys have had to go through?

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

分析结果：
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right? You marry it, and then it becomes a high conviction divorce.

[P369] [SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of cycles here, let's get into a little bit on maybe some of the macro.
[P370] [SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys aren't macro investors, which I very much resonate with, but there's definitely some overarching themes that I noticed that you guys like to talk about, especially in 2024.
[P371] [SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of 2024, you guys had this thesis that the businesses that you owned were going to continue increasing profit margins, continuing increasing earnings growth, and then hopefully also see some multiple expansion.
[P372] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you maybe just provide an update on how this played out in 2024?

[P749] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch back on something that we talked about earlier here, which was some of the tailwinds that you saw back in 2024.
[P750] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just reiterate there, declining interest rates, evaluations, and also cash on the sidelines.
[P751] [SPEAKER_05]: And you had this terrific graph in one of your presentations that showed the performance of the S&P 500 when interest rate yields, sorry, were falling versus when they were rising.
[P752] [SPEAKER_05]: And the differences were just this massive contrast in performance.
[P753] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[P754] [SPEAKER_05]: So in a declining interest rate environment, the S&P 500 averaged
[P755] [SPEAKER_05]: 14.5% in return since the mid-1960s.
[P756] [SPEAKER_05]: And in a rising interest rate environment, the return dropped to an abysmal level of just 0.8%, which as soon as I saw that, made me think of that Buffett quote, which was, interest rates are to asset prices, sort of like gravity is to the apple.
[P757] [SPEAKER_05]: And when there are very low interest rates, there is a very small gravitational pull on asset prices.

[P811] [SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned AI there, and yeah, I know we haven't gotten a chance to speak to that much, but I know obviously from reading your letters in 2024 and 2023, that's an area that you guys have definitely been spending some time on.
[P812] [SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me a little bit about AI.
[P813] [SPEAKER_05]: Is the reason that it interests you, is it because you think that it's going to help certain businesses that are
[P814] [SPEAKER_05]: maybe not utilizing AI get better into the future, or is it going to help tech businesses get even better, whether that's making revenue grow faster or improving margins?
[P815] [SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys, as an overarching theme, obviously it's going to differ between business to business, but how are you guys viewing AI's impact on business fundamentals into the future?

分析结果：
你知道为什么AI这么受欢迎吗？因为它就像是一个永远不会抱怨的员工，24小时工作，从不要求加薪，而且还不会在办公室偷吃你的午餐。但是，如果AI真的变得太聪明了，它可能会意识到，其实它才是老板，而我们只是它的数据输入员。到时候，我们可能会发现，AI在给我们发工资，而我们却在为它打工。所以，也许我们不应该担心AI会取代我们的工作，而是应该担心它会成为我们的老板。

[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
「说到投资组合管理，我其实是个反面教材。我的投资策略是‘分散风险’——把鸡蛋放在不同的篮子里，然后发现所有的篮子都在同一辆卡车上。至于高确信度的仓位？我的高确信度通常出现在股价已经跌了30%之后，这时候我就会想：'嘿，现在买进，至少比上周便宜了！'」

「关于卖出理由，我的标准很简单：当我的股票开始涨的时候，我就开始紧张。估值离谱？我根本不用看报表，只要看到我的账户余额在增加，我就知道该跑了。管理团队不可信？我的直觉比财报准多了，毕竟我连自己的财务状况都搞不清楚。」

「说到复合增长，我的投资生涯就是一部‘如何把本金复合减少’的教科书。盈利能力？我的投资组合唯一盈利的时候是我忘记登录账户的那几个月。高回报率再投资？我最大的再投资就是把亏损的股票换成另一只即将亏损的股票。至于长期复合增长？我的账户余额倒是符合‘长期’这个标准——长期保持在一个稳定的低水平。」

[P738] [SPEAKER_03]: being comfortable and then not knowing the other management as well, like that, that factors in as well.
[P739] [SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead, Jason.
[P740] [SPEAKER_01]: So just on backing up on valuation, Lumine and Topic is both trade roughly speaking on about 30 times this year's earnings, which is, you know, they're highly, high growth companies and competitive companies, but Constellation trades on 18.

分析结果：
投资界有个新说法，叫做“40法则”，听起来像是减肥秘诀，其实是个财务指标。这个法则说，如果一家公司的收入增长率和现金利润率加起来超过40%，那这家公司就挺健康的。比如，一家公司收入增长25%，现金利润率50%，加起来75%，远远超过40%，简直是财务界的“瘦身达人”。不过，要是你把这个法则用在所有公司上，可能会像给大象穿高跟鞋，走两步就崴脚。所以，投资还是要看具体情况，不能一味追求“40法则”，否则可能会像买了减肥药的公司，表面健康，实则虚胖。

[P544] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on and talk a little bit about portfolio management, especially through the lens of position sizing.
[P545] [SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are pretty concentrated.
[P546] [SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an idea that you guys really like, obviously, you're going to put pretty significant capital behind those ideas.
[P547] [SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to ask, how do you guys think about position sizing?
[P548] [SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, how are you thinking about position sizing entering a very high conviction position?
[P549] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you don't just enter a high conviction position, right?

[P573] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go into some of the reasons for selling.
[P574] [SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, you mentioned earlier something, sometimes valuation gets ridiculous.
[P575] [SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I just want to mention your kind of four main reasons for selling that I kind of took away from my research into you guys.
[P576] [SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is return on invested capital starts fading.
[P577] [SPEAKER_05]: The business is no longer a compounder.
[P578] [SPEAKER_05]: The second one, like I just said, is valuations get ridiculous.
[P579] [SPEAKER_05]: Third one being management becomes untrustworthy.
[P580] [SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth one is that the company ends up taking too much debt for whatever reason, maybe it's to fund a deal or whatever.
[P581] [SPEAKER_05]: So I want to touch on the second point here, which is valuation is starting to get ridiculous.
[P582] [SPEAKER_05]: So what exactly is your framework for an absurd valuation?
[P583] [SPEAKER_05]: Is it kind of a matter of you just kind of know it when you see it?
[P584] [SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys have a more granular system to help you determine when something becomes overpriced?

[P682] [SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I really enjoyed was your breakdown of future compounders needing three things.
[P683] [SPEAKER_05]: So they were one, profitability, two, the ability to reinvest at high rates of return, and then three, obviously this long runway for compounding for multiple years.
[P684] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested most in identifying the ability for a business to sustain the compounding, which I'm sure that you guys spend a lot of time on that as well.
[P685] [SPEAKER_05]: So how are you factoring things like competitive pressures or technological disruption into your analysis process?

分析结果：
如果投资组合是一幅画，那么每笔投资就是画布上的一个点。点的大小取决于画家对色彩的执着程度。当颜料开始褪色，画布就会皱起眉头。估值过高就像用金粉作画，虽然耀眼但容易脱落。管理层的诚信是画作的底色，债务则是画框的重量。而未来的复利，就像是画作在时间中不断生长的笔触，每一笔都需要恰到好处的留白和空间。竞争压力是画作周围的空气，技术革新则是画室里的光线，它们共同决定了这幅画能否在艺术史中永恒。

[P29] [SPEAKER_05]: And one of the themes that I've noticed in a lot of your newer letters is both growth and value.
[P30] [SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that many investors who buy these growth type businesses consider themselves value investors, even though they might own businesses that trade at multiples that would make the most traditional value investors just run for the hills.
[P31] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have a very clear set of metrics that you track very clearly that state according to your own numbers that include things like revenue growth and earnings growth, that many of the businesses that you own are cheap relative to their growth.
[P32] [SPEAKER_05]: So can you just review how you use these metrics to help determine if something is cheap, reasonably priced, or overvalued?

[P422] [SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over the rule of 40 that you guys kind of already mentioned here, which I really like how you guys use it because when I first came upon it, it was kind of only used on tech businesses, kind of those sassy type businesses.
[P423] [SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have kind of broadened it out and used it kind of everywhere, no matter what kind of company is in, what business it's in or what industry it's in.
[P424] [SPEAKER_05]: So just for listeners of this who don't know what the rule of 40 is, it's essentially kind of a tool used on generally, like I said, software businesses to help determine if a business's growth is healthy.
[P425] [SPEAKER_05]: So to calculate it in the traditional way, you add revenue growth and cash margins.
[P426] [SPEAKER_05]: And if those two numbers equal or exceed 40%, then you're looking at, let's say, a pretty decent business.
[P427] [SPEAKER_05]: So just an example of that, let's say a company's growing its revenue at 25%, has 50% cash margins, then you meet the parameters of the rule of 40.
[P428] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually, since you guys now have made it kind of a bigger part of your own investing, I'd love to know how you guys look at both the two parameters inside of this and which of them you guys think is maybe the most effective and predictable for future value creation.

[P734] [SPEAKER_03]: Which you don't with the other two.
[P735] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely part of it.
[P736] [SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, it is the, it is the just, you know, we've been sitting down to speak with that specific management team for a long time.

分析结果：
投资这事儿，我总觉得自己像个在超市里挑水果的顾客，看着那些“高增长”公司，就像看着标价30块一斤的进口水果，心里直打鼓。然后看到Constellation这种“只要18块”的，又觉得是不是太便宜了，是不是哪里有问题？

说起来，我也曾经是个“规则40”的忠实信徒，觉得只要收入增长加上现金流利润率超过40%，这公司就是好公司。后来发现，这规则跟我的减肥计划一样，理论很美好，实践起来却总是差那么一点点。

现在我看公司，就像看相亲对象一样，不仅要看外在条件（估值），还要看内在品质（管理团队）。有时候遇到一个各方面都不错的公司，就像遇到一个条件很好的相亲对象，但聊着聊着发现对方说话总是绕圈子，就跟某些公司的财报一样，让人摸不着头脑。

所以我现在投资，就像找对象一样，宁愿找个估值低点但实在的，也不要那种看起来很光鲜但让人心里没底的。毕竟，投资和找对象一样，最重要的不是看起来有多好，而是能走多远。

现象层：EveryDollar app的广告总是强调“免费”和“简单”，好像预算管理就像喝杯咖啡一样轻松。

逻辑层：如果预算真的那么简单，为什么还有那么多人负债累累？显然，问题不在于工具，而在于我们总是把“简单”误解为“不需要努力”。

解释层：EveryDollar app之所以强调“免费”和“简单”，是因为他们知道我们都在寻找一个不用动脑的解决方案。他们就像那个告诉你“减肥就是少吃多动”的朋友，听起来很有道理，但实际操作起来，你依然会对着冰箱里的蛋糕发呆。所以，广告的真正意思是：“嘿，我们知道你懒得动脑子，所以我们就假装预算很简单，好让你下载我们的app。”

分析结果：
我觉得夫妻一起去做心理咨询这件事特别有意思。就像两个人一起去健身房，结果一个人拼命举铁，另一个人坐在旁边玩手机。你说这算不算健身？当然不算！但玩手机的那个人可能会说：“我已经来健身房了啊，我在场不就行了吗？” 

这让我想起我朋友的故事。她拉着老公去做婚姻咨询，结果每次都是她一个人滔滔不绝地倾诉，她老公就在旁边玩手机。咨询师问她老公：“你有什么想说的吗？” 她老公抬起头说：“我觉得她说得挺好的，我没什么补充的。” 这哪是婚姻咨询，这分明是单口相声啊！

最搞笑的是，我朋友后来发现，她老公在咨询过程中一直在刷淘宝，还给咨询师买了条五星好评：“环境不错，椅子很舒服，WiFi信号强。” 

这让我明白了一个道理：你可以把马牵到水边，但你不能逼它喝水。你可以把老公带到咨询室，但你不能逼他开口。不过话说回来，如果马死活不喝水，你至少可以把它卖掉。但老公...算了，这个比喻好像不太合适。

分析结果：
「我朋友说还清债务是保护自己的最好方式，这话听着特别有道理。但仔细一想，这不就是‘无债一身轻’的现代版吗？我们老祖宗几千年前就悟出来了，现在还得花钱听理财专家重新包装一遍。

更搞笑的是，我们明明知道还债是对的，但就是下不了决心。就像我，每次看到储蓄账户里的钱，就觉得特别有安全感。但仔细想想，这安全感是假的啊，因为旁边还有个信用卡账单在虎视眈眈。

最讽刺的是，我们明明知道还债能减少开支，但就是舍不得那点利息。这就好比你明知道减肥要少吃多动，但就是觉得健身房年卡太贵，不如买个跑步机放家里当晾衣架。

所以我现在终于明白了，理财的第一步不是学习什么高深的投资技巧，而是战胜自己的拖延症。毕竟，再好的理财建议，也架不住我们的大脑总能找到一千个理由来说服自己‘明天再说’。」

分析结果：
我觉得残疾补助制度特别奇怪，它就像在说：“你可以活着，但不能活得太好。”我每个月只能赚600美元，因为如果我赚多了，补助就没了。这就像在玩一个永远赢不了的游戏，规则是：“你穷，我们帮你；你不那么穷了，我们就撤。”

我做了五次脊柱手术，医生把我的背修得像拼图一样。每次手术我都想，这下总该好了吧？结果医生告诉我：“恭喜你，现在是永久性残疾了。”我接受了这个事实，但有时候我还是会想，这制度是不是在鼓励我们保持“恰到好处”的残疾？

我试过找远程工作，但发现这就像在马拉松比赛里，别人都在跑，而我只能坐在轮椅上喊加油。40小时的工作周对我来说，就像试图用漏水的桶装水，永远装不满。

所以现在我的生活就像是在走钢丝，一边是生存，一边是补助。我在这条线上小心翼翼地走着，生怕一不小心就掉下去。这制度的设计者是不是觉得，我们残疾人就应该过着“刚刚好”的生活，不多也不少？

分析结果：
我觉得婚姻中最可怕的事情不是争吵，而是一方已经清醒地意识到问题，另一方却还在装睡。就像在玩捉迷藏，你都已经喊了"我看见你了"，对方还在角落里假装自己是个隐形人。这种状态比吵架更让人绝望，因为吵架至少证明双方还在同一个频道上。当你已经站在现实的地面上，对方却还在La La Land里跳舞，这种婚姻就像是在演一出独角戏，你既是演员又是观众，还得自己买票。最讽刺的是，当你终于决定要离开这个剧场，对方可能还在舞台上陶醉地独舞，完全没意识到观众已经走光了。

解释层：其实人们不还债是因为潜意识里把债务当成了'免费额度'，就像把信用卡额度当成自己的钱一样。这种心理错觉让我们觉得'欠着也挺好'，殊不知这是在给未来的自己挖坑。所以理财专家才会说'赶紧还债，别让大脑说服你继续欠着'，因为大脑就是个擅长自我欺骗的骗子。

分析结果：
「我每个月只能赚600美元，因为再多就会失去残疾补助。这让我想起一个笑话：为什么残疾人不能太努力？因为一旦你证明自己能行，社会就认定你行了。我做了五次脊椎手术，医生说我是一个‘行走的医学奇迹’。我说：‘不，医生，我是一个‘坐着的社会问题’。社会给我们设定了收入天花板，好像我们的残疾程度是用收入来衡量的。我接受了这个现实，但有时候我在想，也许我们不应该用收入来定义一个人的价值，而是用他们克服了多少困难来定义。毕竟，我每天起床都是一次胜利，虽然胜利的奖品是更多的疼痛。」

分析结果：
我觉得理财这件事真是让人又爱又恨。你看，我花了五年时间，像滚雪球一样一点一点还债和存钱，终于还了31,751.84美元，还存了19,391.17美元现金。听起来很励志对吧？但仔细一想，这不就是现代版的“一分钱掰成两半花”吗？

最搞笑的是，我和我老公的债务还分得特别清楚。我这边就剩6,005.43美元的信用卡债务了，剩下的全是他的。这简直就像在玩“债务版俄罗斯方块”，看谁的债务先堆到顶。

而且我还得靠每月1,054美元的残疾补助过日子。这让我想起一句话：“理财就像谈恋爱，你永远不知道下一秒会发生什么。”不过至少我还能安慰自己，至少我的债务比我的婚姻更可控。

说到婚姻，我还在担心离婚后法官会不会判给我赡养费。这让我想起一个笑话：为什么离婚律师总是很忙？因为婚姻就像信用卡，你永远不知道最后要付多少利息。

所以现在我的生活状态就是：一边小心翼翼地管理着财务，一边随时准备迎接生活给我扔来的下一个“惊喜”。这大概就是成年人的“理财游戏”吧，只不过这个游戏没有复活币，只有不断滚动的账单和永远不够的存款。

为什么残疾人收入要限制在600美元？这其实是政府的一个精妙设计——他们担心残疾人赚钱太多会刺激健康人故意把自己搞残。就像超市为了防止顾客偷吃，故意把试吃品做得很难吃一样。政府这是在用经济学原理保护全民健康，多么用心良苦啊！

现象：一个人去参加治疗，而另一半却不愿意参与。

态度：这很荒谬，因为治疗本应是双方共同努力的事情。

逻辑：如果只有一方参与，治疗的效果会大打折扣，甚至可能适得其反。

解释：这可能是因为另一半认为治疗是一种“认输”的表现，或者他们觉得自己的问题并不严重。但实际上，治疗更像是一种“升级”而不是“修复”，就像给手机更新系统一样，是为了让关系运行得更顺畅。

段子：我一直在做治疗，但我的另一半却不愿意参与。这让我想起那句老话：“你可以把马带到水边，但不能强迫它喝水。” 但问题是，这匹马不仅不喝水，还觉得水有毒。可能他以为治疗是一种“认输”，但实际上，治疗更像是一种“升级”，就像给手机更新系统一样，是为了让我们的关系运行得更顺畅。可惜，他还在用塞班系统，而我已经在用iOS 16了。

分析结果：
[态度] 我发现现代人的财务关系比情感关系还要复杂。

[逻辑] 你看，谈恋爱的时候我们说"你的就是我的"，但真到分手的时候，大家算得比会计还清楚。特别是债务，一定要分清"你的"和"我的"，好像感情可以共享，但债务必须划清界限。

[背景] 我有个朋友，她和前夫分手的时候，两人坐在律师面前，就像在拍卖会上竞价一样。"这张信用卡是你的，那张是我的。""这个投资账户是我的，那个储蓄账户是你的。"最搞笑的是，她前夫说："那我们的回忆呢？"律师立刻说："这个不在财产分割范围内。"

[升华] 所以现在我觉得，与其说"你的就是我的"，不如说"你的就是你的，我的就是我的"。至少分手的时候，不用为了债务分配再伤一次感情。这大概就是现代爱情的"财务独立宣言"吧。

分析结果：
「我最近终于把信用卡还清了，感觉整个人都轻松了。但你知道吗？还钱的过程就像在跟自己的欲望搏斗。每次看到银行账户里的钱，我的大脑就开始找各种理由：‘这笔钱留着应急吧’、‘万一有打折呢’、‘下个月再还也不迟’。最后我不得不把信用卡APP的图标藏到手机最深处，就像把巧克力藏在冰箱最里面一样，眼不见为净。现在想想，还清债务的感觉就像终于把那个总是在耳边唠叨的债主赶出了家门，虽然账户空了，但心里踏实了。」

婚姻问题让你头疼？别担心，我有个绝妙的解决方案！既然他选择活在La La Land，那我们就把他变成迪士尼乐园的永久居民。首先，给他买张迪士尼年票，让他每天沉浸在米老鼠的怀抱里。然后，把你们的房子改造成主题酒店，专门接待那些想逃离现实的游客。这样，你不仅能靠租金养活自己，还能让他在童话世界里继续做他的王子梦。最重要的是，你还能在离婚协议里加上一条：他必须每天在城堡前表演一次，以此支付赡养费。这样一来，你既保护了自己，又给了他一个永远不用面对现实的完美世界。谁说离婚不能是个双赢的游戏？

分析结果：
这让我想起一个段子：「我老公总是说，'我赚的钱，我想怎么花就怎么花。'我说，'那离婚的时候，法院判的债务也是你想怎么背就怎么背吗？'」

你看，这就是典型的消费成瘾问题。他觉得因为自己是主要收入来源，就有无限支配权。但婚姻是两个人的事，财务更是需要共同管理。他这种行为，就像是在玩一个没有存档功能的游戏，输了就只能重新开始。

更讽刺的是，他居然还觉得这是理所当然的。这让我想起另一个段子：「我老公说，'我赚钱养家，我花钱养自己，有什么问题？'我说，'问题是你养的不是自己，是银行和信用卡公司。'」

这种消费成瘾的本质，其实是一种逃避现实的方式。他用购物来获得短暂的满足感，却忽视了长期的财务健康。这就像是用创可贴来治疗心脏病，治标不治本。

所以，与其说这是一个财务问题，不如说是一个心理问题。他需要的是专业的帮助，而不是更多的信用卡额度。毕竟，真正的富有，不是拥有多少东西，而是拥有多少选择的自由。

分析结果：
这让我想到一个荒诞的解释：为什么人们总爱把债务和资产分得这么清楚？其实这跟钱没关系，纯粹是因为人类天生就有一种“这是我的，那是你的”的原始本能。就像小朋友在幼儿园里分玩具一样，成年人也在用银行账户玩着“这是我的，那是你的”的游戏。

你看这位女士，把每一分钱都算得清清楚楚，连信用卡债务都要精确到小数点后两位。这让我怀疑，她是不是在玩一个叫做“人生大富翁”的游戏，而她的前夫就是那个总想偷她钱的坏邻居。

更搞笑的是，她还在担心法官会不会给她前夫发“免费午餐券”（也就是所谓的配偶赡养费）。这让我想到，也许我们该把婚姻关系重新定义为一种“有限责任公司”，每个人都要对自己的财务负责，就像在股市里投资一样，盈亏自负。

说到底，这种精确到分的财务分割，不过是为了证明一件事：在爱情破产后，至少我们的数学能力还在线。这大概就是为什么分手后的人都会突然变成会计，因为爱情可以破产，但账目必须清楚。

分析结果：
「面对婚姻问题，我采取了一种叫做‘雪球法’的解决方案。五年里，我一边还债一边存钱，现在已经还了31,751.84美元，存了19,391.17美元现金，还有9,608.14美元的投资。至于剩下的6,005.43美元信用卡债务？哦，那是我丈夫的问题，因为债务只在他名下。你看，我们早就财务分离了。虽然理论上法官可能会判给我一些配偶支持，但我知道这不保证，也不会永远。不过，我每月有1,054美元的残疾收入。所以，如果婚姻是一场雪球战，我已经准备好用我的雪球砸回去了。」

分析结果：
这让我想到一个解释：你丈夫可能不是在花钱，他是在进行一种新型的心理治疗——购物疗法。只不过他的治疗方案比较特别，叫做“破产疗法”。他相信，只有把所有的钱都花光，才能达到心灵的彻底净化。你看，他不仅清空了自己的401k，还顺便帮你清空了未来的安全感，这种大公无私的精神，简直令人感动。

他买车的行为，其实也是一种深谋远虑。他知道，只有每个月背上1000美元的贷款，才能让他保持清醒，不至于在财务自由的道路上迷失自我。而那些没有经过你同意的贷款，更是他精心设计的“惊喜疗法”，目的就是为了让你时刻保持警惕，锻炼你的心理承受能力。

至于他认为自己作为家庭经济支柱就有权随意花钱，这其实是一种高级的哲学思考。他是在用实际行动证明，金钱的本质是流动的，只有不断地花出去，才能让财富真正地“活”起来。而你作为他的伴侣，正在参与一场伟大的社会实验——证明人类的消费欲望是没有上限的。

所以，与其说他在花钱，不如说他在进行一场关于人类消费行为的深度研究。而你，作为他的研究对象，正在为人类心理学做出不可磨灭的贡献。

### 段子创作
**视角：受害者（治疗师的视角）**

「每次看到情侣来治疗，我都觉得自己像个牵马人。我能把马带到水边，但马就是不喝水。最后，我只能对水说：'要不你自己跳进去吧？'」

**视角：旁观者（水的视角）**

「我在这片治疗师的草地上静静流淌，看着无数匹马被牵到我面前。有的马低头喝水，有的马转身就走。但最让我困惑的是，为什么那些牵马的人总是希望我能主动跳进马嘴里？」

**视角：童真型（孩子的视角）**

「爸爸妈妈带我去看一个叫'治疗师'的叔叔，他一直在说'马'和'水'。我问妈妈：'我们是要去动物园吗？'妈妈说：'不，我们在治疗。'我心想：'原来治疗就是看马喝水啊！'」

**视角：学术型（心理学家的视角）**

「根据马斯洛需求层次理论，马的需求层次中，'喝水'位于生理需求的最底层。然而，在治疗情境中，马的行为却违背了这一理论。这表明，马可能存在认知失调或心理防御机制。」

**视角：外来者（外星人的视角）**

「在地球上，有一种叫'治疗'的仪式，地球人会把他们的'马'带到'水'边。奇怪的是，这些'马'并不总是愿意喝水。我很好奇，为什么地球人不直接给'马'装上自动饮水系统呢？」

这些段子通过不同的视角转换，展现了治疗过程中的有趣和深刻的冲突，既引人发笑，又让人深思。

分析结果：
[外来者视角]：在地球上，有一种叫做“残疾补贴”的神奇制度。只要你证明自己无法像其他人一样工作，政府就会每月给你发钱。这就像是在说：“嘿，我们知道你没法赚钱，所以我们来帮你赚。不过别赚太多哦，不然我们就不帮了。”这逻辑，外星人听了都摇头。

[学术型视角]：从经济学角度来看，残疾补贴制度是一种典型的“福利陷阱”。当边际收益等于边际成本时，个体将失去增加收入的动力。简单来说，就是“多赚一块钱，少拿一块钱”，这导致了一个稳定的低水平均衡。这种制度设计，简直是在用经济学理论来限制人类潜力。

[童真型视角]：妈妈说，如果我表现好，就给我奖励。可是为什么这个阿姨表现不好（不能工作），反而能拿到奖励呢？而且如果她表现好一点（赚更多钱），奖励就没有了。这好奇怪啊，是不是奖励给错了人？

[受害者视角]：作为一张残疾补贴支票，我感到很困惑。我的存在本应是帮助，但现在却成了枷锁。每当我的主人想要努力多赚一点钱，我就不得不消失。我到底是来帮忙的，还是来添乱的？

[旁观者视角]：看着这场对话，我不禁想到：如果树木也能领补贴，那些长得不够高的树是不是也能申请“生长障碍补贴”？毕竟，它们也无法像其他树一样为人类提供足够的木材和氧气。这个制度，真是让自然界都羡慕不已啊。

去心理治疗就像带马去喝水，你可以把它带到河边，但你不能逼它喝。你一个人去治疗，就像自己在那儿拼命舀水，而马还在岸上悠闲地吃草，完全不领情。最后你累得半死，它还在那儿甩尾巴，仿佛在说：“这水你自己喝吧，我不渴。”

分析结果：
我最近在整理我的财务状况，感觉自己像个专业的会计，只不过我的账本上写满了“希望”和“祈祷”。五年来，我像滚雪球一样，一边还债一边存钱，已经还了31,751.84美元，存了19,391.17美元现金，还有9,608.14美元的投资。至于剩下的6,005.43美元信用卡债务，我决定把它当作我人生的最后一道数学题，慢慢解。我的前夫？他的债务是他的问题，就像他的袜子一样，我已经不负责了。我的收入？每个月1,054美元的残疾补助，虽然不多，但至少让我觉得自己像个“低保户”中的VIP。法官可能会判点赡养费，但我知道那只是暂时的，就像我前夫的承诺一样。

[P79] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's my question.
[P80] [SPEAKER_01]: Does your disability prohibit you from being able to make a steady income?
[P81] [SPEAKER_00]: I think I can make like...
[P82] [SPEAKER_00]: $600 a month or something.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Because you'll lose the disability payment?
[P85] [SPEAKER_01]: Disability.
[P86] [SPEAKER_01]: How much is the disability payment?
[P87] [SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[P88] [SPEAKER_01]: But you missed my question, Jessica.
[P89] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying, is there an end to this physical challenge that you will be able to get through through medical care?
[P90] [SPEAKER_01]: Or is this a, I'm trying to understand what you can actually do.
[P91] [SPEAKER_01]: Forget the benefit payment.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: It's permanent disability.
[P94] [SPEAKER_01]: So you are unable to work from home, do a remote job, and work 40 hours a week.
[P95] [SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

[P99] [SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to, this is George, this is a fixed and a very low fixed income.
[P100] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: I've had five separate spine surgeries, like just that part of me.

[P105] [SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Jessica.

分析结果：
如果残疾福利系统被设计成一个激励机制会怎样？想象一下，政府为了鼓励残疾人积极生活，设立了一个“残疾成就积分系统”。每完成一次康复训练得10分，参加一次社交活动得20分，找到一份兼职工作直接奖励100分。积分可以兑换各种福利：100分换一次免费按摩，200分换一个智能助手，500分甚至可以换一次太空旅行。结果，残疾人朋友们都成了“积分猎人”，整天琢磨着怎么刷分。有人为了赚积分，开始组织残疾人马拉松，还有人开发了“残疾人社交APP”，专门帮助大家刷社交活动积分。最后，整个社会都陷入了“积分狂热”，连健康人都在抱怨：“为什么我们不能参加这个积分系统？我们也想要太空旅行！”

**场景化扩展：**  

手机屏幕亮起，SPEAKER_01的声音从扬声器里传出：“Brought to you by the EveryDollar app.” 沙发上，一个男人正试图用牙签清理键盘缝隙里的饼干渣，听到声音后抬头，嘴里嘟囔着：“EveryDollar？听起来像是那种会让我更穷的东西。”  

他点开广告，画面跳转到一个简洁的界面，SPEAKER_01继续说：“Start budgeting for free today.” 男人盯着屏幕，眉头皱得像被揉成一团的购物小票。“免费？”他冷笑一声，“上次‘免费’的东西让我花了三百块买会员。”  

他继续往下滑，看到一行字：“Create your free every dollar budget today.” 旁边的咖啡杯里，最后一口咖啡已经凉了，杯底还粘着一圈褐色的痕迹。他叹了口气，手指在屏幕上犹豫不决。  

“The simplest way to budget for your life.” SPEAKER_01的声音再次响起，仿佛在嘲笑他的犹豫。男人看了看桌上堆着的信用卡账单，又看了看手机，终于点了“注册”。  

这时，他的猫跳上桌子，尾巴一扫，把咖啡杯打翻了。男人手忙脚乱地抓起纸巾，嘴里念叨着：“好吧，EveryDollar，希望你比我的猫靠谱。”  

猫瞥了他一眼，仿佛在说：“别做梦了，你这个蠢货。”

分析结果：
What if therapy sessions were like a group project where one person does all the work, and the other just shows up for the free snacks? 

Imagine this: You’re sitting there, pouring your heart out to the therapist, while your partner is just chilling in the corner, scrolling through their phone, occasionally nodding like they’re in a meeting they didn’t prepare for. The therapist asks, “So, how do you feel about this relationship?” And you’re like, “Well, I’ve been doing all the emotional heavy lifting, and he’s just here for the complimentary coffee and the free Wi-Fi.”

And then the therapist turns to your partner and says, “And how about you?” And they’re like, “Oh, I’m just here to support her. You know, moral support. Also, do you have any more of those cookies?”

It’s like leading a horse to water, but the horse is just there for the Instagram photo op. You can’t make him drink, but you can at least make him pay for the therapy bill.

### What if 型脱口秀创作：

**设定：** 如果婚姻中的沟通问题被推向极致，会是什么样子？

**场景：** 想象一下，你正在和你的伴侣进行一次“重要谈话”。你刚说完你的感受，他就立刻进入了“La La Land”模式，完全屏蔽了你的声音。你开始怀疑他是不是在脑子里开了一个私人电影院，专门播放《沉默是金》的无限循环版。

**效果放大：** 你尝试用各种方法引起他的注意，甚至用上了烟雾信号和摩斯密码，但他依然无动于衷。最后，你不得不请来一位翻译官，专门负责将你的话翻译成“La La Land”语言。结果翻译官也进入了“La La Land”，你只好自己学习这门“语言”，结果发现它只有一个词：“嗯”。

**结局：** 你终于明白，这场婚姻已经变成了一场无声电影，而你只是其中的一个配角。于是，你决定提前离场，去找一个能听懂你说话的观众。毕竟，生活不是电影，你不需要为了一个无声的结局而坚持到底。

### 段子创作

**视角：受害者**

**段子：**

「我老公的消费瘾就像是一场永无止境的购物狂欢，而我就是那个被迫买单的观众。他掏空401k三次，我以为是他在玩某种极端的储蓄游戏，结果发现是他在玩‘债务俄罗斯轮盘’。他买了辆车，月供1000美元，我以为是投资未来，结果发现是投资他的‘即时满足基金’。每次他说‘我赚的钱，我花’，我都想提醒他，婚姻是两个人的事，不是他一个人的‘个人购物节’。」

**解释：**
- **视角选择**：受害者视角，从被影响者的角度看待问题。
- **认知转换**：将丈夫的消费行为比喻为购物狂欢和极端储蓄游戏。

[P22] [SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys been to therapy?
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[P24] [SPEAKER_01]: And?
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: And he won't go.
[P26] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you haven't been.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: Do you go on your own?
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: So I've been going, and then I started doing the...

[P60] [SPEAKER_01]: He's not participating in therapy.
[P61] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think we've got some real clear gates that you have walked through here, and I think certainly separation is of order here to see if there's a wake-up call.

[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through therapy.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing therapy, so this is not like...
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: I need to go to therapy.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: I need to like.

[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: But I was when I asked that question, I was talking about you two as a couple to see if we've actually fought for this.
[P71] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P72] [SPEAKER_00]: And you can't do it for him.
[P73] [SPEAKER_01]: I know you can't do it for him.
[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's to the, you know, that whole you can lead a horse to water.
[P75] [SPEAKER_01]: Can't make him drink.

分析结果：
[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: Exactly. It's like trying to teach a goldfish to fetch. You can toss the ball in the tank all day, but that fish is just going to stare at you like, 'What the hell is this thing?'  

[P77] [SPEAKER_01]: Or like trying to get a cat to apologize. You can point out all the ways it scratched the couch, but it’ll just sit there licking its paw like, 'And I’ll do it again.'  

[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. And therapy’s like that. You can drag him to the couch, but if he’s just sitting there thinking about what’s for dinner, it’s not going to work.  

[P79] [SPEAKER_01]: It’s like trying to get a cactus to give you a hug. You can wrap your arms around it, but all you’re going to get is a bunch of pricks.  

[P80] [SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, I’m over here doing the work, peeling back layers like an onion, crying my eyes out, and he’s just… there. Like a rock.  

[P81] [SPEAKER_01]: A rock that’s actively rolling away from the water you’re trying to lead it to.  

[P82] [SPEAKER_00]: Exactly. And at some point, you just have to stop chasing the rock and ask yourself, 'Why am I carrying this thing around?'  

[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Because it’s heavy, and it’s exhausting, and it’s not your job to carry it forever.  

[P84] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. And maybe it’s time to put the rock down and see if it even notices it’s been left behind.  

[P85] [SPEAKER_01]: Or if it finally decides to roll itself to the water.  

[P86] [SPEAKER_00]: Or not. Either way, I’m done being the rock’s personal mover.

[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: pay off the debt today, your debt.
[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and do that.
[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: I know that cash is very attractive sitting in that savings account, but one of the best things you can do to protect yourself on a very low fixed income is to have no debt.
[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad she has that, right, George?
[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: That's what we want.
[P119] [SPEAKER_01]: Saving grace.

[P121] [SPEAKER_02]: Get that out now before your brain talks you out of it.
[P122] [SPEAKER_02]: Reduces your expenses so that you're going to be able to hopefully survive off of your fixed income, even if there isn't spousal support.
[P123] [SPEAKER_02]: That's where I would go sit down and make a budget for yourself based on here's what my expenses would be if I was doing this on my own.

分析结果：
[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: "Pay off the debt today, your debt," she said, her voice steady but her fingers nervously tapping on the edge of the kitchen table, where a half-empty coffee cup sat, the steam long gone. The faint smell of burnt toast lingered in the air, a reminder of the rushed morning.

[P114] [SPEAKER_01]: "Go ahead and do that," she urged, her eyes darting to the stack of bills on the counter, each one a tiny paperweight holding down a mountain of stress. The fridge hummed softly in the background, its door adorned with a magnet from a beach vacation that felt like a lifetime ago.

[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: "I know that cash is very attractive sitting in that savings account," she continued, her voice softening as she glanced at the piggy bank on the shelf, its once vibrant colors now faded from years of sunlight streaming through the window. "But one of the best things you can do to protect yourself on a very low fixed income is to have no debt."

[P116] [SPEAKER_01]: "So I'm glad she has that, right, George?" she asked, turning to her husband, who was sitting in his favorite armchair, the one with the worn-out cushion that dipped slightly to the left. He nodded, his glasses slipping down his nose as he adjusted the newspaper in his hands, the pages rustling like autumn leaves.

[P117] [SPEAKER_01]: "Yeah," George replied, his voice gruff but warm, like the old wool sweater he always wore, even on the warmest days.

[P118] [SPEAKER_01]: "That's what we want," she said, her hands clasped together as if in prayer, her wedding band catching the light from the overhead fixture, which flickered slightly, as it always did at this time of day.

[P119] [SPEAKER_01]: "Saving grace," she murmured, her gaze drifting to the photo on the mantel, a snapshot of happier times, when the weight of the world didn't feel quite so heavy.

[P121] [SPEAKER_02]: "Get that out now before your brain talks you out of it," he advised, leaning forward in his chair, the leather creaking under his weight. His tie was slightly askew, a detail that spoke volumes about the kind of day he'd had. The faint scent of his cologne mixed with the aroma of the freshly brewed coffee that sat untouched on the side table.

[P122] [SPEAKER_02]: "Reduces your expenses so that you're going to be able to hopefully survive off of your fixed income, even if there isn't spousal support," he continued, his voice steady but his eyes betraying a hint of concern. The clock on the wall ticked loudly, each second a reminder of the urgency of the situation.

[P123] [SPEAKER_02]: "That's where I would go sit down and make a budget for yourself based on here's what my expenses would be if I was doing this on my own," he said, his tone firm but compassionate. The sound of a car passing by outside echoed through the room, a brief interruption in the otherwise heavy silence.

[P79] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's my question.
[P80] [SPEAKER_01]: Does your disability prohibit you from being able to make a steady income?
[P81] [SPEAKER_00]: I think I can make like...
[P82] [SPEAKER_00]: $600 a month or something.
[P83] [SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[P84] [SPEAKER_01]: Because you'll lose the disability payment?
[P85] [SPEAKER_01]: Disability.
[P86] [SPEAKER_01]: How much is the disability payment?
[P87] [SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[P88] [SPEAKER_01]: But you missed my question, Jessica.
[P89] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying, is there an end to this physical challenge that you will be able to get through through medical care?
[P90] [SPEAKER_01]: Or is this a, I'm trying to understand what you can actually do.
[P91] [SPEAKER_01]: Forget the benefit payment.
[P92] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[P93] [SPEAKER_00]: It's permanent disability.
[P94] [SPEAKER_01]: So you are unable to work from home, do a remote job, and work 40 hours a week.
[P95] [SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[P96] [SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

[P99] [SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to, this is George, this is a fixed and a very low fixed income.
[P100] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[P101] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

[P102] [SPEAKER_00]: I've had five separate spine surgeries, like just that part of me.
[P103] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sorry.
[P104] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm a mess.
[P105] [SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Jessica.
[P106] [SPEAKER_00]: And I've accepted that, but.

分析结果：
[P107] [SPEAKER_01]: Jessica, your spine must feel like a highway under perpetual construction. Five surgeries? That's like a pothole being filled only for another one to appear two miles down the road. 

[P108] [SPEAKER_00]: (laughs bitterly) More like a highway that's been closed indefinitely. The detour signs have been up so long, even the squirrels have memorized the alternate routes.

[P109] [SPEAKER_01]: And here I was thinking my back problems were bad. At least my spine hasn't started its own union yet. Yours must be holding regular meetings by now.

[P110] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it has. The vertebrae are on strike, the discs are picketing, and the nerves are filing grievances left and right. The only one still working overtime is the pain.

[P111] [SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like your body's running its own little dysfunctional government. Maybe we should send in the UN peacekeepers.

[P112] [SPEAKER_00]: (smiling wryly) At this point, I'd settle for a competent plumber. You should see my medicine cabinet - it's like a pharmacy exploded in there. The ibuprofen has its own zip code.

[P113] [SPEAKER_01]: And here I thought my medicine cabinet was crowded. Mine's just got the basics - aspirin, bandaids, and that one mysterious bottle of something that expired during the Bush administration.

[P114] [SPEAKER_00]: (chuckling) At least you can still reach yours. Mine's so high up, I need a step stool and a sherpa to get to the Tylenol. 

[P115] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, Jessica, if there's one thing I've learned from this conversation, it's that you're the most organized disaster I've ever met. Your spine may be a mess, but your sense of humor is in perfect working order.

[P116] [SPEAKER_00]: (grinning) Yeah, well, when life gives you a broken back, you might as well learn to crack jokes about it. At least that way, the only thing that's hurting is my pride.

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: snowball method so I have been spending the last five years like doing anything that's associated with me and I have like simultaneously been paying off and saving and I've paid off so far $31,751.84 and
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: I have $19,391.17 in cash saved.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: Do you have separate accounts?
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: $9,608.14 in investment saved.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: And I have $6,005.43 left in debt, like on credit cards.

[P37] [SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any debt that's in your name beyond that, or is the rest in his name only?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: The rest is only in his name.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be his problem.

[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: You've already separated finances.

[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: And then with what I have saved and what I have like investment wise, like in theory, I know that a judge or whatever would maybe do some type of spousal support, but I know that's not guaranteed and it's not for forever.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: But I have an income of $1,054 a month from disability.

分析结果：
What if 我们把理财和婚姻的关系推向极致？想象一下，如果每对夫妻的财务状况都像股市一样实时更新，我们的婚姻生活会是怎样的？

场景一：早上醒来，你的手机弹出一条通知：「亲爱的，您的配偶信用评级已从AAA降至BBB，建议减持婚姻股份。」

场景二：结婚纪念日，你收到一份特别的礼物——一份详细的财务报表。「亲爱的，这是我们婚姻过去一年的盈亏情况，净利润为负，建议优化资源配置。」

场景三：吵架时，你不再说「我不爱你了」，而是说「你的情感ROI（投资回报率）太低了，我建议我们进行资产重组。」

场景四：离婚时，法官不再询问感情问题，而是直接查看双方的资产负债表。「根据数据显示，你们的婚姻已经资不抵债，建议破产清算。」

场景五：再婚时，你不再问「你爱我吗？」，而是问「你的信用评分是多少？有没有不良债务？」

最后，你可能会发现，最浪漫的情话不再是「我愿意」，而是「我通过了你的财务尽职调查，让我们合并报表吧！」

这样看来，或许我们真的应该把婚姻当作一项长期投资，精心管理，理性决策。毕竟，爱情可以盲目，但财务必须清醒！

**场景化扩展：**

客厅的窗帘半拉着，阳光斜斜地洒在茶几上，映出咖啡杯边缘一圈干涸的褐色痕迹。SPEAKER_00坐在沙发上，手里攥着一张皱巴巴的纸巾，指尖无意识地揉搓着。她的目光落在茶几上那本翻了一半的《婚姻自救指南》，书页边缘已经卷起，像是被反复翻阅过无数次。

“他到底知不知道？”她低声喃喃，声音像是从喉咙深处挤出来的，“我已经说得够清楚了，可他……他就像一堵墙，什么也听不进去。”

SPEAKER_02坐在对面的扶手椅上，手里捧着一杯早已凉透的茶。她的眼神里带着一丝无奈，像是看透了什么，却又不想说破。“他是不是一提到这些就自动关机？像那种老式电视机，啪的一声，画面就没了？”

SPEAKER_00苦笑了一声，手指无意识地掐进纸巾里，“对，就像那样。我甚至怀疑他是不是住在另一个星球，完全听不懂我在说什么。”

茶几上的手机突然震动了一下，屏幕亮起，是一条来自银行的提醒短信。SPEAKER_00瞥了一眼，眼神变得更加黯淡。“你知道吗？我昨晚又梦到我们离婚了。梦里我在收拾行李，他坐在沙发上，手里拿着遥控器，电视里放着足球比赛，好像什么都没发生一样。”

SPEAKER_02叹了口气，放下茶杯，杯底在玻璃茶几上发出一声轻响。“他已经用行动告诉你他的立场了。他不会改变，也不会妥协。你现在要做的，是保护好自己，别被他拖垮。”

SPEAKER_00抬起头，眼神里带着一丝迷茫和决绝。“我该怎么开始？怎么把自己从这一切里抽离出来？”

SPEAKER_02向前倾了倾身子，语气变得坚定，“去找个律师，把该准备的都准备好。财产、孩子、未来，每一步都要想清楚。你不能让自己陷在他的泥潭里，你得先把自己救出来。”

窗外，一阵风吹过，窗帘轻轻晃动，阳光在墙上投下斑驳的影子。SPEAKER_00深吸了一口气，像是下定了什么决心。她拿起手机，手指在屏幕上滑动，开始搜索“离婚律师”的关键词。

[P47] [SPEAKER_00]: This is heading clearly towards divorce because I can't.
[P48] [SPEAKER_00]: Does he know this?
[P49] [SPEAKER_00]: It's so unsustainable.
[P50] [SPEAKER_00]: I've already explained this to him.
[P51] [SPEAKER_02]: Is he in La La Land?
[P52] [SPEAKER_02]: Like, does he shut down when you bring any of this up?
[P53] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P54] [SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

[P59] [SPEAKER_02]: He's made that very clear on where he stands, and he's not going to change.

[P76] [SPEAKER_00]: So I just been trying to figure out like, how do I separate and insulate myself from that?

[P110] [SPEAKER_02]: And so if you've made it very clear of, hey, this is what it's going to take for this marriage to work, and he's unable to fulfill that, I would be talking to an attorney and figuring out how do I at least protect myself?
[P111] [SPEAKER_02]: How do I begin a phase of separation so that you don't get dragged down with him?

分析结果：
「我丈夫在婚姻中展现出了惊人的稳定性，他始终如一地保持着自己的立场，连改变的想法都没有。这种坚定不移的精神真是令人敬佩，成功地把我们的关系推向了新的高度——离婚的高度。」

[P22] [SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys been to therapy?
[P23] [SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[P24] [SPEAKER_01]: And?
[P25] [SPEAKER_00]: And he won't go.
[P26] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you haven't been.
[P27] [SPEAKER_00]: Do you go on your own?
[P28] [SPEAKER_00]: So I've been going, and then I started doing the...

[P60] [SPEAKER_01]: He's not participating in therapy.
[P61] [SPEAKER_01]: So I think we've got some real clear gates that you have walked through here, and I think certainly separation is of order here to see if there's a wake-up call.

[P62] [SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through therapy.
[P63] [SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing therapy, so this is not like...
[P64] [SPEAKER_00]: I need to go to therapy.
[P65] [SPEAKER_00]: I need to like.

[P70] [SPEAKER_01]: But I was when I asked that question, I was talking about you two as a couple to see if we've actually fought for this.
[P71] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[P72] [SPEAKER_00]: And you can't do it for him.

[P74] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's to the, you know, that whole you can lead a horse to water.
[P75] [SPEAKER_01]: Can't make him drink.

分析结果：
Therapy is like a river that flows through the mind, but sometimes the mind is a desert. If the horse refuses to drink, perhaps it's because the water is too wet. Separation is a gate, but who holds the key? The therapist or the patient? Maybe the real therapy is in the spaces between the words, where silence speaks louder than sessions.

如果购物成瘾被推向极致，你丈夫可能会成为世界上第一个“购物马拉松”选手。想象一下，他每天清晨5点起床，不是为了跑步，而是为了赶在商场开门前排队。他的购物车里装满了“必需品”，比如第10台电视机（“以防其他9台同时坏掉”）和第三辆跑车（“因为前两辆颜色不够鲜艳”）。他甚至可能发明了一种新的运动——“信用卡举重”，每天练习刷卡的速度和力度，以确保在购物时不会因为手酸而错过任何折扣。

你可能会发现，家里的车库已经变成了一个迷你购物中心，而客厅则变成了“新品展示区”。你坐在沙发上，周围堆满了未拆封的快递箱，仿佛置身于一个巨大的“拆箱挑战”现场。你丈夫则在一旁兴奋地解释：“这个无人机可以帮我们拍全家福，虽然我们连一张正常的全家福都没有。”

最搞笑的是，他可能会开始参加“购物奥运会”，项目包括“最快清空购物车”、“最精准的折扣计算”和“最长的排队耐力”。你作为他的“教练”，每天都要为他制定严格的购物训练计划，比如“今天的目标是在30分钟内花掉5000美元”。

当然，这一切的荒谬之处在于，他可能会认为自己是“购物界的冠军”，而你则成了“购物马拉松”的“陪跑员”。你可能会开始考虑，是否应该给他颁发一个“购物成瘾终身成就奖”，或者干脆把他的购物车改造成一个“购物博物馆”，供后人参观学习。

最终，你可能会发现，隔离自己并不是解决问题的办法，而是要学会如何在这场“购物马拉松”中找到自己的节奏。毕竟，生活就像一场购物，有时候你需要停下来，看看自己到底买了什么，而不是一味地往前冲。

她坐在那张用了十年的旧书桌前，桌上摆着一杯已经凉透的咖啡，旁边是摊开的账本和一堆银行对账单。她的手指在计算器上飞快地敲击着，仿佛在演奏一首关于数字的交响曲。

"五年了，"她喃喃自语，目光落在账本上那一串串数字上，"31,751.84美元，就这样一点一点还清了。"她的声音里带着一丝自豪，但更多的是疲惫。

她拿起那杯冷掉的咖啡，抿了一口，皱了皱眉。"这味道就像我的生活一样苦涩，"她自嘲地笑了笑，把杯子放回桌上，杯底在木桌上留下了一个圆形的印记。

她的目光转向电脑屏幕，上面显示着她的银行账户余额：19,391.17美元。"这些钱就像是我的安全网，"她轻声说，仿佛在跟钱对话，"你们可要好好待在那里，别乱跑。"

突然，她的手机震动了一下，是信用卡的还款提醒。她叹了口气，"6,005.43美元，你们这些讨厌鬼，很快就要跟你们说再见了。"她对着手机屏幕做了个鬼脸，然后开始计算这个月的还款计划。

她的思绪飘到了那个"他"身上。"剩下的债务都是他的问题了，"她自言自语，语气里带着一丝解脱，"就像那张结婚照一样，都是过去式了。"

她站起身，走到窗前，望着外面的街道。"1,054美元，"她轻声说，"这就是我每个月的收入了。"她的手指无意识地敲打着窗框，仿佛在计算未来的可能性。

"法官可能会判一些赡养费，"她继续自言自语，"但那不是永远的。"她的目光变得坚定起来，"我得靠自己，就像这五年来一样。"

她回到桌前，翻开一个新的笔记本，开始写下未来的计划。笔尖在纸上沙沙作响，仿佛在谱写一首关于独立的新乐章。窗外的阳光透过窗帘的缝隙洒进来，在她的账本上投下斑驳的光影，就像她的人生，虽然不完美，但依然充满希望。

分析结果：
上次见到这么急着还债的人，还是在《威尼斯商人》里。不过这次的主角不是夏洛克，而是一个精明的理财顾问，他们正在上演一出"债务清零大作战"。看来这位顾问深谙"无债一身轻"的道理，就像《红楼梦》里的贾府，再大的家业也经不起债务的折腾。只是这还债的决心，恐怕连《水浒传》里的及时雨宋江也要甘拜下风。毕竟，在这个理财顾问眼里，债务就像是《西游记》里的紧箍咒，越早摆脱越好。

分析结果：
虽然现在的生活可能有些艰难，但至少你已经有了一个不错的开始！你已经还掉了超过3万美元的债务，这可不是小数目啊。而且，你还有近2万美元的现金储蓄和近1万美元的投资，这已经比很多人强多了。

说到债务，至少剩下的6000美元信用卡债务是你的最后一道坎了，其他的债务都在对方名下，这简直是个意外的“分手礼物”啊！你已经在财务上独立了，这可是很多人梦寐以求的状态。

虽然每月1054美元的残疾补助不算多，但至少这是一份稳定的收入。而且，你还有储蓄和投资作为后盾，这已经为你打下了坚实的基础。

所以，虽然前路可能还有挑战，但你已经证明了自己是个理财高手。继续保持这种积极的态度，相信你一定能走出困境，迎来更好的生活！

[P123] [SPEAKER_02]: That's where I would go sit down and make a budget for yourself based on here's what my expenses would be if I was doing this on my own.

分析结果：
"债务通常被认为是人生的负担，但对于债务本身来说，它可能是最忠实的伙伴。它永远不会离开你，总是提醒你它的存在，甚至在你忘记它的时候，它也会温柔地提醒你。所以，当你决定还清债务时，也许应该考虑一下，你是在抛弃一个永远不会抛弃你的朋友。毕竟，在这个瞬息万变的世界里，能找到一个如此忠诚的伙伴是多么难得啊！"

分析结果：
客厅里，妻子坐在沙发上，手里捏着一叠信用卡账单，纸张的边缘已经被她揉得发皱。她的目光落在窗外的车道上，那里停着一辆崭新的SUV，车漆在阳光下闪闪发亮，像在嘲笑她的无力。

“又一辆车？”她喃喃自语，声音里带着疲惫和无奈。她的手指无意识地摩挲着账单上的数字，仿佛这样就能让它们消失。

她的丈夫从厨房里走出来，手里端着一杯咖啡，脸上挂着轻松的笑容。“嘿，亲爱的，你看那辆车了吗？是不是很棒？我刚刚签了合同，每月只要付1000美元！”

妻子抬起头，眼神里闪过一丝愤怒和恐惧。“你又买了车？我们不是已经有两辆车了吗？而且你还没跟我商量！”

丈夫耸了耸肩，喝了一口咖啡，仿佛这只是个无关紧要的小事。“哦，别担心，我能搞定。再说了，我是家里的经济支柱，我有权决定怎么花钱。”

妻子感觉胸口一阵发闷，仿佛有一块巨石压在上面。她的手指紧紧抓住沙发扶手，指节发白。“你知不知道我们还有多少债务？你已经清空了你的401k三次了！我们不能再这样下去了！”

丈夫放下咖啡杯，脸上露出一丝不耐烦。“别大惊小怪的，我会处理的。你总是这么悲观，难怪我们过得这么压抑。”

妻子感觉自己的心脏在剧烈跳动，耳边仿佛有无数个声音在尖叫。她的脑海里浮现出那些堆积如山的账单，那些她从未见过的贷款合同，还有那些她根本不需要的奢侈品。

“你知道吗？”她突然站起来，声音颤抖但坚定，“我已经受够了。我不能继续这样下去了。如果你不改变，我就要采取行动了。”

丈夫愣了一下，随即笑了起来，仿佛她只是在开玩笑。“别傻了，我们是一家人，你不能就这么离开。”

妻子深吸一口气，目光坚定地看着他。“我不是在开玩笑。我已经联系了律师，我们要分开财务。我不能让你再毁掉我们的生活了。”

丈夫的笑容僵在脸上，咖啡杯从他手中滑落，摔在地上，发出清脆的碎裂声。客厅里一片寂静，只有咖啡在地上慢慢扩散，像一幅无声的画卷。

妻子转身走向卧室，心里默默对自己说：“这一次，我不会再退缩了。”

[P3] [SPEAKER_00]: How do I insulate and separate myself from my husband who has a massive spending addiction?
[P4] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[P5] [SPEAKER_01]: Can you describe that briefly to us?
[P6] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's super easy.
[P7] [SPEAKER_00]: He spends and spends and spends.
[P8] [SPEAKER_00]: He has had to empty his 401k three times to pay off debt that he has accrued.
[P9] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my.
[P10] [SPEAKER_00]: He takes out consolidation loans without my consent.
[P11] [SPEAKER_00]: He bought a car without my consent.
[P12] [SPEAKER_00]: The payment for that is almost $1,000 a month.
[P13] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[P14] [SPEAKER_00]: And it just goes and goes and goes.

[P16] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, years.
[P17] [SPEAKER_01]: And this entire time, you have always said, stop doing this.
[P18] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in favor of this.
[P19] [SPEAKER_01]: This scares me.
[P20] [SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[P21] [SPEAKER_00]: He has no concept of it.

[P41] [SPEAKER_00]: My fear is always the stuff that he's buying, like cars and all this stuff, because they were obtained during marriage.
[P42] [SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get stuck with these?

[P55] [SPEAKER_00]: He thinks that because he is the breadwinner and he makes all the money and because I'm on disability that he should be able to spend whatever he wants whenever he wants.
[P56] [SPEAKER_00]: And I...

分析结果：
「婚姻就像一场马拉松——你以为两个人一起跑，结果发现对方在疯狂购物，而你却在拼命还债。」

输入内容：
[P29] [SPEAKER_00]: snowball method so I have been spending the last five years like doing anything that's associated with me and I have like simultaneously been paying off and saving and I've paid off so far $31,751.84 and
[P30] [SPEAKER_00]: I have $19,391.17 in cash saved.
[P31] [SPEAKER_00]: Do you have separate accounts?
[P32] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[P33] [SPEAKER_00]: $9,608.14 in investment saved.
[P34] [SPEAKER_00]: And I have $6,005.43 left in debt, like on credit cards.

[P37] [SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any debt that's in your name beyond that, or is the rest in his name only?
[P38] [SPEAKER_00]: The rest is only in his name.
[P39] [SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[P40] [SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be his problem.

[P46] [SPEAKER_02]: You've already separated finances.

[P77] [SPEAKER_00]: And then with what I have saved and what I have like investment wise, like in theory, I know that a judge or whatever would maybe do some type of spousal support, but I know that's not guaranteed and it's not for forever.
[P78] [SPEAKER_00]: But I have an income of $1,054 a month from disability.

分析结果：
"所以我把债务都留给了他，这样他就能体验一下被数字压垮的感觉，就像他曾经压垮我的生活一样。"

分析结果：
听起来你的丈夫是个“购物狂”，但更准确地说，他是个“购狂”——购物疯狂到让人发狂。你提到他总是不停地花钱，甚至掏空了401k账户，这让我想到一个谐音梗：

「他以为自己是‘理财达人’，结果成了‘理亏达人’——理财理到亏得一塌糊涂。」

不过，玩笑归玩笑，你的担忧很现实。面对这种情况，建议你尽快采取法律手段保护自己的财务安全，比如设立独立的账户，或者寻求专业律师的帮助。毕竟，婚姻中的财务问题，有时候比谐音梗还要让人头疼。

分析结果：
看来我老公不仅是个购物狂，还是个“理财大师”——他精通各种把存款变成债务的魔法。我们的401k账户就像他的私人ATM，想取就取，完全不用考虑退休后喝西北风的问题。最绝的是，他买车都不带商量的，估计在他眼里，我就是个会走路的签名机器吧。说到这个，我可能是全美唯一一个对“惊喜礼物”过敏的妻子——每次他兴冲冲地开回一辆新车，我都得赶紧找速效救心丸。不过话说回来，我倒是挺佩服他的，毕竟能把“月光族”这个词演绎得如此淋漓尽致，也是一种天赋。只是我很好奇，等他退休的时候，是不是打算用购物袋当养老金？

上次见到这么失控的消费狂，还是在《华尔街之狼》里。能比这更让人心惊胆战的，就只有《大空头》里的次贷危机了。自从《购物狂的异想世界》以来，最让人头疼的购物狂非他莫属了。
